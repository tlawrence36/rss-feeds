      "An academy member since 2014, Taylor has served the organization in several high-profile positions, including as vice president and chair of the awards committee. She\u2019s also a prolific film producer whose works include \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (2018), \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and \u201cThe Accountant.\u201d She also produced the 92nd Oscars broadcast.

    "story": [
      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Herman compares the movie to another Sony animation: \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which also attracted a broad audience with its creative animation. \u201cAnd it's a fun, animated musical, which we haven't had in a while,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.\u201d",
      "Santiago was initially skeptical of the title \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. They kind of like to take advantage of K-pop fans\u2019 sincerity,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cBut I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.\u201d",
      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",

      "\u201cFiguring out what makes K-pop tick in a way that resonates with musical fans was really important to this movie,\u201d said Herman.",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B.

      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",

      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "\"The Bad Guys 2\" hits theaters, and it's a wild ride",
      "The good news for fans of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d is the new sequel is stellar. But that's because a good portion is actually set in \u2014 are you kidding us? \u2014 outer space. \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d has clearly lost its moorings.",
      "Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days \u2014 amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",
      "The gang is all back: Sam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf,Marc Maron as safe-cracker Mr. Snake, Craig Robinson as master-of disguise Mr. Shark, Anthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha and Awkwafina as hacker Ms. Tarantula. We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to change has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Wolf, pushing the George Clooney-like charm offensive, begs one dubious interviewer. \u201cI'm just asking for a chance.\u201d",
      "A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron \u2014 so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Now he spends his days doing Vinyasa yoga, listening to Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso,\u201d telling people \"namaste\" and sips wheatgrass kombucha with dandelion. He's even more irritating.",
      "Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew \u2014 Danielle Brooks\u2019 lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova\u2019s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne\u2019s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on \u201cPoker Face.\u201d These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever \u2014 or lazy \u2014 joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot.",

Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a \u201c24-carat catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. The franchise's love of vroooming and fishtailing Looney Tunes-like car chases stays intact, as does the wavy green air farts that emanate from Piranha.",

It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it.

(Another thing to chew on: If \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d is a worse sequel, does that make \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d good?)",

He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d (There's going to be a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d)",
      "The joy of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like \u201cOcean\u2019s 11.\u201d This time, the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series gets mocked, as does \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and maybe \u201cMoonraker,\u201d which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: \u201cWe've got one shot to save the world.

      "So what does it all mean? It means the folks behind \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but \u2014 c'mon, everyone \u2014 they didn't make it count.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG for \u201caction/mild violence, rude humor, and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "For two-plus decades, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival has been a cultural reunion, a summer sanctuary and a safe haven where some of the industry's most influential voices converge in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev.

      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",
      "Set on the campus of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Performing Arts Center and the Vineyard Lounge, the festival has grown from a grassroots gathering into a premier destination where Black creatives can find inspiration, connection and support.",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",

      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",

      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",
      "\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \"But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\"",
      "Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d",
      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",
      "\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Fans of the Grateful Dead are pouring into San Francisco for three days of concerts and festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the scruffy jam band that came to embody a city where people wore flowers in their hair and made love, not war.",
      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",

      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",

    "story": [
      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

(He didn't need to tell his listeners that it was a bastion of segregation at the time.) \"Pollution\" takes a look at the then-new concept that perhaps rivers and lakes should be cleaned up.",

      "\u201cWho they came to see?\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 asks as she performs her 2023 single \u201cMy House\u201d during the Cowboy Carter tour. For many, the answer has been Blue Ivy.",
      "Blue Ivy Carter, the Grammy-winning artist\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, is more present than ever on stage, and fans are impressed by the growth from her first performance years ago to now.",
      "Isabella Kerr, 15, has admired Beyonc\u00e9 for years, but said she attended the Cowboy Carter tour specifically to experience Blue Ivy\u2019s moves in person.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying, \u201cOh, she\u2019s a mini Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d but no, I think she\u2019s the first Blue. Everything about her when she\u2019s on stage is electrifying,\u201d said Kerr.",
      "The Cowboy Carter tour concludes Saturday in Las Vegas. The tour\u2019s 30 previously stops have fans buzzing that Blue Ivy is well on her way to being a next generation powerhouse.",
      "Blue first graced the stage at 11 years old during her mother\u2019s 2023 Renaissance tour, appearing during the legacy-celebrating anthems \u201cMy Power\u201d and \u201cBlack Parade.\u201d Supporters anticipated her performance at each stop.",
      "She performed again during \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Bowl,\u201d the NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show that was just nominated for four Emmy Awards. She danced alongside the icon as she performed songs from the \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album for the first time.",
      "\u201cEven the difference between the Renaissance Tour and now, you can tell she\u2019s really grown in her confidence,\u201d said fan and artist Olivia Ellis. \u201cYou can tell she has a different vibe about her.\u201d",
      "On the Cowboy Carter tour, she can almost be mistaken for one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s professional dancers. She is on stage for nearly every song and has a solo recreating her mother\u2019s choreography from her 2006 \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0-vu\u201d music video, a nod to the undeniable similarities between the two.",
      "Online videos of Blue display professionalism comparable to her mother\u2019s during the Cowboy Carter tour. During a rainy New Jersey stop, she brought out towels to dry her area of the stage before nailing her \u201cAmerica Has a Problem\u201d choreography.",
      "In another unexpected moment during a Chicago show, her earring got caught on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hair. Blue remained calm, removed the jewelry and motioned to the singer that it was safe in her hand as they both seamlessly continued.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the family business,\u201d said Kinitra D. Brooks, an academic and author of \u201cThe Lemonade Reader,\u201d a collection that explores the nuances of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 visual album, \u201cLemonade.\u201d \u201cShe is literally studying under the best person doing it out there today. Why wouldn\u2019t she take advantage of that opportunity?\u201d",
      "In \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d fans were given a behind-the-scenes look at the decision-making process the first time Blue was allowed to perform. Beyonc\u00e9 expressed how nervous she was about her child being in front of thousands of people made her, revealing she initially said no.",
      "\u201cI did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on a stadium stage,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cI made a deal with her, and I said, \u2018If you practice and you show your commitment, I\u2019ll let you do one show.\u2019\u201d Blue Ivy fulfilled her end of the deal, and a fan base was formed: the \u201cIvy League.\u201d",
      "Kerr says Blue\u2019s accomplishments inspire her to work harder to achieve her own dreams. \u201cShe worked to be on stage, and look at her now. If I work to what I want to be, I can be killing it like her.\u201d",
      "At last month's Cowboy Carter Paris stop, members of the Beyhive and Ivy League finally got what they had been asking for \u2014 Blue Ivy merchandise. Shirts with the teen\u2019s face and the phrase \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Blue\u201d plastered on the front were available for purchase.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax rules aimed at reducing auto tailpipe emissions",
      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",
      "It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.",
      "EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.",
      "\u201cAutomakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won\u2019t abandon their EV development efforts,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. \"But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.\u201d",

      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations.

      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",

      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",

      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \u201cno brainer\u201d way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\u201d",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",

      "Under Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children\u2019s saving program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That\u2019s not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cNo wonder people aren\u2019t having children and our birth rates are going down.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \u201cbaby bonuses,\u201d a policy similar to Rx Kids.",

      "A group of more than 20 states are suing the Trump administration over efforts to cut Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis attack isn't just about abortion,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt's about denying vulnerable communities access to care they rely on every day.\u201d",
      "But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, named a defendant in the suit, defended the provision.",
      "\u201cStates should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care,\u201d spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon said in an email. \u201cIt is a shame that these democrat attorney generals seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.\u201d",
      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",

      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June.

      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",

      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",

He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris.

      "John Lindley, president and CEO of the industry group Michigan Manufactured Housing Association, said the rarity of such cases is evidence that state and local law enforcement are choosing not to enforce the rules.",
      "\u201cThis whole notion that, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do about this.\u2019 Clearly there is, or that prosecution wouldn\u2019t have taken place,\u201d Lindley said. \u201cNot having the authority to go after communities that don\u2019t have a license is completely different from choosing not to go after those. And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable. The group says it supports extending water protections to within parks, as called for in this year\u2019s legislation. It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "A United Nations report highlights rising food insecurity in Africa, with over 1 billion people unable to afford a healthy diet in 2024",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion \u2014 some two-thirds of the continent's population \u2014 in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday.",
      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",
      "A major mark of distress is the number of Africans unable to afford a healthy diet. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period.",
      "That means the vast majority of Africans are unable to eat well on the continent of 1.5 billion people.",
      "The U.N. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks \u2014 in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance \u2014 were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 \u201chunger hot spots.\u201d",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

And like many former POWs, he still battles hypervigilance \u2014 listening for threats, scanning his surroundings. At night, sleep comes in fragments, and that was true even before a recent uptick in nightly drone attacks by the Russian army.",

      "\u201cI love music. Music unites,\u201d he said, touching the tattoo of a treble clef behind his ear \u2014 inked after his return. Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- A group of elderly people trapped in a flooded nursing home were among at least 70 people who died during powerful storms that lashed Beijing and neighboring provinces.",
      "Officials said Thursday 31 people died at the Taishitun Town Elderly Care Center when Beijing's Miyun district became one of the hardest hit areas by storms that dumped nearly a year's worth of rain in the area over a few days. Flood waters surged in the area Monday and many were caught unprepared.",
      "Officials offered a rare public apology Thursday when they announced the deaths.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, this senior center was in the town's center and was safe, and such was not included in the preparedness plans. This means that our prepared plans had holes,\u201d Miyun Party secretary Yu Weiguo said, expressing his condolences and adding it was a \u201cbitter lesson.\"",
      "The care center housed 69 residents, including 55 who were disabled in some capacity. The facility sat on low-lying ground near a river that had flooded after the unusually intense rains, local media outlet Caixin reported. When the floods hit Monday, there were 77 people in the building including staffers.",

      "China\u2019s government censors have tightened information control since leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, seeing it as crucial to preventing unrest. In recent years, increasingly more topics from negative news about the economy to basic information about violent attacks, such as the number of injured people, have been subject to censorship.",
      "When the waters came this week, they rose quickly to 2 meters (6.5 feet) at the deepest points, Beijing officials said.",
      "Many couldn't escape. One Beijing resident's 87-year old mother managed to get out of the elder care center in Miyun, Caixin reported.",

      "The killing of a collared lion involved in a research project in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter has been condemned by wildlife groups",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The killing of a collared lion involved in a research project in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter has been condemned by wildlife groups, echoing the infamous case of a lion called Cecil whose death at the hands of an American tourist in the same country a decade ago was met with international outrage.",
      "The latest lion, known as Blondie, was part of an Oxford University study and wore a research collar sponsored by Africa Geographic, a safari company. Africa Geographic said Blondie was killed by a hunter in June close to the country's flagship Hwange National Park after being lured out of a protected area and into a nearby hunting zone with the use of bait.",
      "After Blondie's killing became a new rallying cry for those opposed to hunting, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe's National Parks told The Associated Press on Thursday that the hunt was legal and the hunter had the necessary permits. Zimbabwe allows up to 100 lions to be hunted a year. Trophy hunters, who are usually foreign tourists, pay tens of thousands of dollars to kill a lion and take the head or skin as a trophy.",
      "Africa Geographic CEO Simon Espley said Blondie's killing made \u201ca mockery of the ethics\u201d trophy hunters claim to prescribe to because he wore a clearly visible research collar and was a breeding male in his prime. Hunters say they only target ageing, non-breeding lions.",
      "\"That Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d Espley said.",
      "Hunting lions is fiercely divisive, even among conservationists. Some say if it is well managed it raises money that can be put back into conservation. Others want killing wildlife for sport to be banned outright.",
      "Some countries in Africa like Kenya have commercial hunting bans, others like Zimbabwe and South Africa allow it. Botswana lifted a ban on hunting six years ago.",
      "Tinashe Farawo, the spokesperson for the Zimbabwe parks agency, said money from hunting is crucial to support the southern African nation's underfunded conservation efforts. He defended the hunt and said they often happen at night, meaning the collar on Blondie may not have been visible.",
      "He said he had no information on Blondie being lured out of the park with bait \u2014 which is usually a dead animal \u2014 but there \u201cis nothing unethical or illegal about that for anyone who knows how lions are hunted. This is how people hunt.\u201d",

      "More than three years after they were seized from their homes, concerns are growing for three Ukrainians who worked for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe",
      "VIENNA -- It was late at night when they came for Dmytro Shabanov, a security assistant in eastern Ukraine at the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.",
      "His seizure from his home in the Luhansk region in April 2022 \u2014 weeks after Moscow's full-scale invasion \u2014 was part of a coordinated operation by pro-Russian forces who detained him and two other Ukrainian OSCE workers. Maksym Petrov, an interpreter, also was seized in the Luhansk region, while Vadym Golda, another security assistant, was detained in neighboring Donetsk.",
      "More than three years later, the three Ukrainian civilians who had worked with the international group\u2019s ceasefire monitoring efforts in the eastern regions remain behind bars. They have not been part of recent large-scale prisoner exchanges with Russia.",
      "Their detention has raised alarm among OSCE officials, Western nations and human rights advocates, who demand their immediate release while expressing concern about their health and prison conditions amid allegations of torture.",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian mission to the OSCE did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on those allegations or on OSCE personnel having immunity from prosecution as international civil servants.",
      "\u201cHe was taken from his home after the curfew took effect,\u201d said Margaryta Shabanova, Shabanov\u2019s wife, who lives in Kyiv. \u201cI had a last call with him around 20 minutes before it happened.\u201d",
      "After his arrest, Shabanov disappeared for three months, held incommunicado by Russian separatists and interrogated in a Luhansk prison until he was forced to sign a confession.",
      "That fateful night turned Shabanova\u2019s life upside down.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, I wake up hoping that today will be different -- that today I will hear that my Dima is free,\u201d she said. \u201cPainfully, days stretch on, and nothing changes. The waiting, the not knowing, the endless hope slowly turning into quiet despair.\u201d",
      "Fighting back tears, Shabanova describes life without her husband.",
      "\u201cThe silence at the dinner table, the birthdays and holidays have been missed for over three years. People say to me that I am strong, but they don\u2019t see the moments I collapse behind closed doors,\u201d she said.",
      "The Vienna-based OSCE monitors ceasefires, observes elections, and promotes democracy and arms control, and Shabanov \u201creally liked his job\u201d at the international organization, said his wife, especially working with the foreign staff. She said her husband believed that \u201cinternational service could protect lives and make the world a little more just.\u201d",
      "The OSCE had operated a ceasefire monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists had been fighting Ukrainian government troops since 2014, with about 14,000 killed even before the full-scale invasion. The monitors watched for truce violations, facilitated dialogue and brokered local halts in fighting to enable repairs to critical civilian infrastructure.",
      "But on March 31, 2022, Russia blocked the extension of the OSCE mission, and separatist leaders declared it illegal the following month.",
      "It remains unclear whether the three detained OSCE staffers had tried to flee eastern Ukraine.",
      "Locally recruited Ukrainians like Shabanov, Petrov and Golda worked in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions to help shut down the OSCE mission. They cleared offices, safeguarded OSCE assets, including armored vehicles, drones and cameras, and oversaw evacuations of their international colleagues. That operation was completed by October 2022.",
      "The three men were arrested despite carrying documents confirming their immunity, the OSCE said.",
      "Shabanov and Petrov were convicted of treason by a Russian-controlled court in Luhansk in September 2022 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Golda, 57, was convicted of espionage by a court in Donetsk, also under Moscow's control, in July 2024 and sentenced to 14 years.",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry said in November 2022 it believed the activities of the OSCE monitors \u201cwere often not only biased but also illegal.\u201d Without identifying the three Ukrainian OSCE staff by name, the ministry alleged that local residents were recruited by the West to collect information for the Ukrainian military and \u201cseveral\u201d were detained.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned.

Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- A neon sign inside the Das Hoven cafe in a trendy Berlin neighborhood proudly proclaims \u201cQUEER AND FRIENDS.\u201d",
      "The sign was intended to show the cafe is a safe space for LGBTQ+ people. But it has also become a beacon for hate and homophobic attacks.",
      "Owner Danjel Zarte said there are 45 pending criminal investigations related to the cafe over the past year and a half, ranging from verbal and physical attacks on patrons and workers to windows being broken or covered in feces and swastika graffiti. One person even stood outside the cafe with a gun.",
      "\u201cAn act of terror,\u201d Zarte said. \"I sometimes have panic attacks in the morning and am afraid to look at my cell phone because I\u2019m afraid that something has happened again.\u201d",
      "Attacks against queer people and gay-friendly establishments are rising across Germany, including in Berlin, a city that has historically embraced the queer community.",
      "Last year, there was a 40% increase in violence targeting LGBTQ+ people in 12 of Germany's 16 federal states as compared to 2023, according to the Association of Counseling Centers for Victims of Right-Wing, Racist and Antisemitic Violence.",
      "Activists say those figures only show a fraction of the probem's scope because victims are often afraid to come forward. They partly blame the rise of the far-right across Europe, including in Germany where the Alternative for Germany party made significant gains in the February election.",
      "Hostility toward LGBTQ+ people serves as a \u201crallying cry\u201d for believers in right-wing extremism, according to Judith Porath, the association's managing director. Experts have seen an increase in demonstrations and violence among neo-Nazis, most of whom are young men.",
      "Bastian Finke, the head of MANEO, an organization tracking anti-gay violence in the capital city, said those who are openly queer on Berlin\u2019s roads \u201cautomatically run a very, very high risk simply because of who they are. To be attacked, to be insulted, to be spat on. We have these scenarios every day.\u201d",
      "The fear was palpable at Saturday's Christopher Street Day parade in Berlin. The annual Pride event commemorates the 1969 Stonewall rebellion in New York City, when a spontaneous street uprising was triggered by a police raid on the Stonewall Inn gay bar on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village.",
      "\u201cThe mood is actually tense: People are afraid, they are unsettled,\" Thomas Hoffmann, a member of the event's executive board, said Saturday.",

      "Samuel Doria Medina is running for president of Bolivia",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- It's no surprise that Samuel Doria Medina is running for president of Bolivia: The 66-year-old multimillionaire ran as a center-right candidate in the elections of 2005, 2009 and 2014. He failed each time as Bolivia's leftist ruling party, founded by former President Evo Morales, maintained a tight grip over politics.",
      "What\u2019s unexpected is that next month, after almost two decades of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party in power, the candidate who promises to arrest Morales and cozy up to U.S. President Donald Trump stands a real chance of victory.",
      "Polls show Doria Medina, owner of hotel chains and Bolivia\u2019s Burger King restaurants, as a front-runner in the Aug. 17 election.",
      "\"Not only are we going to change the president, but the political cycle,\" Doria Medina, a former cement magnate, told The Associated Press Wednesday from his sleek office on the 20th floor of one of Bolivia\u2019s tallest towers that he helped build. \u201cPart of that change will be the emergence of new figures.\u201d",
      "Doria Medina, a successful businessman and entrepreneur, is tapping public outrage over Bolivia\u2019s worst economic crisis since 1991.",
      "He promises unity to voters frustrated by the fracturing of the MAS party between current President Luis Arce and his erstwhile ally, the larger-than-life Morales, who oversaw a so-called economic miracle of rising growth and falling poverty for much of his tenure from 2006-2019.",
      "But Morales' statist economic model, built on natural gas exports, has gone bust. Now the landlocked nation of 12 million is approaching a watershed moment as crippling dollar shortages, mass unrest and fuel scarcity threaten the once-unquestioned dominance of the MAS party founded in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cWe have a population that wants the economic conflict and lack of fuel to be solved,\u201d Doria Medina said.",
      "Much remains uncertain in the run-up to the highly anticipated vote, with Morales\u2019 large base of loyalists vowing to leave their ballots blank on account of the former president\u2019s contentious exclusion from the race \u2014 in part a result of his bitter political fight with Arce.",
      "Facing a humiliating defeat, Arce dropped out of the race.",
      "The only leftist candidate leading polls is Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, the 36-year-old president of the senate and vice president of Morales\u2019 coca-farming union. Rodr\u00edguez would be considered the political heir of Morales' MAS if it weren't for Morales branding him a traitor for running against him.",
      "With other opposition candidates further to the right, analysts see the moderate Doria Medina as best-positioned to win over traditional MAS party supporters as he promises to put the brakes on the foreign exchange rate and resolve fuel shortages within his first 100 days.",
      "The value of a boliviano on the black market is now around half the official exchange rate.",
      "\u201cThis type of crisis has to be resolved very quickly,\" Doria Medina said, citing as a model the shock adjustment of radical libertarian President Javier Milei that drove down Argentina's double-digit inflation.",
      "To achieve such a swift transformation, Doria Medina told AP he would first scrap fuel subsidies, which have long been a politically sensitive pillar of the MAS party\u2019s economic policy. When Morales tried to eliminate the generous subsidies in 2010, mass nationwide riots forced him to backtrack.",
      "\u201cIt's the biggest absurdity that in Bolivia it's $0.30 per liter of gasoline and in all neighboring countries it's $1,\u201d Doria Medina said, dismissing possible fallout from the move. Bolivia hemorrhaged $3 billion subsidizing gasoline and fuel last year.",

      "Arguably the biggest potential prize for the U.S. is Bolivia's large stockpiles of strategic minerals, including lithium, a key component of renewable batteries. Chinese and Russian companies have sought stakes in Bolivian lithium mines that remain largely undeveloped despite Morales' attempts and Arce's ambitions.",
      "After being run out of the presidential election and hit with an arrest warrant on charges related to his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl, Morales remains holed up in his tropical stronghold. He says the allegations are politically motivated.",

      "Ukraine\u2019s Parliament has approved a bill tabled by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that restores the independence of two of the country\u2019s key anti-corruption watchdogs",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill presented by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that restores the independence of two of the country\u2019s key anti-corruption watchdogs, reversing his contentious move last week that curbed their power and brought an outcry.",
      "Last week\u2019s measure by Zelenskyy to place the watchdogs under the oversight of the prosecutor-general prompted rebukes from Ukrainians, the European Union and international rights groups. It raised fears that the government could meddle in investigations and potentially shield its supporters from scrutiny.",
      "Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine\u2019s aspirations to join the EU and maintain access to billions of dollars of vital Western aid in the nearly 3\u00bd-year all-out war. It's also an effort that enjoys broad public support.",
      "EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos, who called last week\u2019s legislative changes \u201ca serious step back,\u201d welcomed approval of the bill, saying lawmakers had \u201ccorrected last week\u2019s damaging vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s law restores key safeguards, but challenges remain,\u201d Kos, who monitors the record of countries that are candidates to join the bloc, wrote on X. \u201cThe EU supports (Ukrainian) citizens\u2019 demands for reform. Upholding fundamental values & fighting corruption must remain the priority.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said his country \u201cis committed to reforms and the fight against corruption\u201d and that Zelenskyy \u201cdemonstrated a principled approach.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe got it fixed,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "At the start of a livestream of the parliamentary session, which was the first to be broadcast live since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, two lawmakers could be seen exchanging punches. Although the reason for the scuffle was not known, it occurred amid a tense atmosphere in the chamber where the speaker\u2019s podium is flanked by Ukrainian and EU flags.",
      "The backlash against Zelenskyy's measures brought street protests across the country, the first major demonstrations since Russia's full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. Though the protests didn\u2019t call for the president's removal, the controversy threatened to undermine public trust in their leaders at a critical time.",

      "The Ukrainian branch of Transparency International also criticized last week's legislation, saying it weakened one of the most significant reforms since what Ukraine calls its Revolution of Dignity in 2014.",
      "Zelenskyy said his goal had been to speed up prolonged investigations, ensure more convictions and remove Russian meddling in investigations, which he didn\u2019t detail.",
      "He said he had taken note of the protests and decided to present a new bill to Parliament underscoring that the prosecutor general and his deputies cannot give orders to anti-graft agencies or interfere in their work.",
      "Lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament in Kyiv, approved Zelenskyy\u2019s new proposal with 331 votes and nine abstentions on Thursday, official figures showed.",

      "South Dakota rancher Calli Williams wants to benefit from high beef prices, but it's not so simple",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- In a period when retail beef prices are at an all-time high and consumers are still willing to pay, South Dakota rancher Calli Williams would love to cash in. But it's not so simple.",
      "Williams and her husband, Tate, raise about 70 cow-calf pairs near Letcher in southeastern South Dakota, roughly 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Mitchell. They own about 80 acres (32 hectares) and rent additional pasture.",
      "Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can\u2019t yet make the financial investments that they\u2019d need to raise production.",
      "\u201cIt is a goal of ours to expand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure if that will be in the 10-year plan or even longer.\u201d",
      "Farmers and ranchers across the U.S. would love to take greater advantage of the high prices, but with the U.S. herd at record lows, they can\u2019t meet the demand quickly. It's basic biology.",
      "\u201cIt takes three years to get more cows \u2014 between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,\" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis.",
      "The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said.",
      "Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just \u201cabnormally dry\u201d in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they\u2019re simply playing catch-up.",
      "Swanson said some of the main cattle areas in North America \u2014 from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada down to Texas in the U.S. \u2014 are just naturally prone to drought. It's often boom or bust.",
      "Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, said a lot of cattle country has had good rain this summer, but it's a cyclical business.",
      "\u201cSometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don\u2019t,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cAnd we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in \u201919, \u201920 and \u201921, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times.\"",
      "And Woodall said his members are still leery. They're asking how long the better weather will last.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.\u201d",
      "Although it\u2019s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment.",
      "When extreme weather collides with tight margins, farmers and ranchers feel the squeeze.",
      "Retail beef prices have hit record highs with no relief for consumers in sight. Ground beef rose to an average of $6.12 per pound in June, up nearly 12% from 2024. The average price of all steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "The total U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it has been at midyear since the government began keeping those figures in 1973, and probably since the 1950s. There were few signs in the U.S. Department of Agriculture data released last Friday that producers have begun rebuilding herds.",
      "As of July 1, the U.S. had 94.2 million cattle and calves, down from the last midyear peak in 2019 of nearly 103 million. Critical for the future supply, 2025 calf production is projected at 33.1 million head, down 1% from last year.",
      "Derrell Peel, a livestock marketing specialist at Oklahoma State University, said if producers were planning to grow their herds, the USDA reports would have shown them keeping heifers \u2014 female cows that haven\u2019t given birth yet.",
      "While retail prices are high, consumers so far have been willing to pay them.",
      "Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University, said taste is the most important consideration when shoppers choose proteins \u2014 and beef remains the favorite.",
      "The late June report found that consumers were willing to fork out $17.62 a pound for rib-eye steaks and $8.82 for a pound of ground beef. That\u2019s more than the $7.13 they\u2019d pay for pork chops, $6.19 for bacon, or $8.55 for chicken breasts.",
      "A major reason, Woodall offered, is that the beef industry has focused on the eating experience.",
      "\u201cThe kind of beef that we are producing today is some of the highest quality, best tasting beef that we\u2019ve ever produced in history here in the United States,\" he said. \u201cSo, things such as USDA prime graded steaks that at one point in time you could only get in a restaurant, you can now get that in a grocery store.\u201d",
      "For consumers who balk at costs, the marketing specialist Peel said, pork and poultry are \u201cabundant and quite favorably priced.\"",
      "The Williamses, who are both 34, built their TW Angus business from scratch. Tate Williams started buying cattle when he was in high school, and they bought their land in 2015. They sell bulls in the spring and keep heifers when they can. They also raise steers in their own feedlot and sell the meat directly to consumers.",
      "\u201cWe would really like to expand our operation,\" Calli Williams said. \"We have a goal of being able to pass this on to the next generation,\u201d Williams said, meaning their sons Jack, 7, and Tommy, nearly 4.",
      "But recalling a friend\u2019s words, she said ranchers are a resilient bunch.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that if Mother Nature \u2014 she wreaked havoc on us, whether that was a drought or a flood \u2014 that next year she\u2019ll be kinder to us, \u201c she said. \u201dOr, if the markets weren\u2019t on our side, we\u2019re optimistic that the markets will be on our side next time.\u201d",

      "An Australian appeals court has ruled against X Corp. in a legal battle with an online safety watchdog",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian appeals court on Thursday ruled against X Corp., rejecting a challenge to a safety watchdog's demands for details on how the Elon Musk -owned company was combating widespread child exploitation material on its platform.",
      "Three federal court judges unanimously rejected X\u2019s appeal against a federal court decision in October last year that the company was obliged to respond to a notice from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant on child abuse material being shared on X, which is incorporated in Texas.",

      "Inman Grant has driven world-first legislation that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from social media platforms including X from December.",
      "The federal court case goes back to early 2023, when Inman Grant asked some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies to report on what they were doing about child abuse material appearing on their platforms.",
      "A reporting notice, issued under Australia\u2019s Online Safety Act, was sent to Twitter Inc., incorporated in Delaware, in February that year.",
      "Twitter merged with X the following month.",
      "X arguments against complying with Inman Grant\u2019s order included that Twitter no longer existed as a legal entity and that X did not carry its predecessor's regulatory obligations in Australia.",
      "Inman Grant, a former Twitter employee, welcomed Thursday\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cThis judgment confirms the obligations to comply with Australian regulations still apply, regardless of a foreign company\u2019s merger with another foreign company,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "She said her agency would continue enforcing the Online Safety Act and \u201cholding all tech companies to account without fear or favor, ensuring they comply with the laws of Australia.\u201d",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher. The figures are above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.",
      "The uptick in prices helps explain the central bank\u2019s reluctance to cut its key interest rate this week, despite repeated demands from Trump that it do so. On Wednesday, the Fed left its key rate unchanged at 4.3%, and Chair Fed Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the import duties will cause just a one-time rise in prices or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than consistent with the 2% target.",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",

Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year.

      "It was the second time in many days that Trump laid into senators in his own party as the president tries, sometimes without success, to publicly pressure them to fall in line. Earlier, Trump tore into veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa over an obscure Senate procedure regarding nominations.",

      "Trump added: \u201cI don\u2019t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the \u2018whims\u2019 of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!\u201d",
      "Stock trading by members of Congress has long been an issue that both parties have tried to tackle, especially as some elected officials have become wealthy while in elected office. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, it was disclosed that lawmakers were trading as information about the health crisis before it became public. Insider trading laws don\u2019t always apply to the types of information lawmakers receive.",

      "GOP senators had been working with the White House on the stock trade bill, and some supported a broad carve-out to exclude the president from the ban, but it failed, with Hawley joining Democrats to block it.",
      "Trump also complained that Hawley joined with Democrats to block another amendment that would have investigated the stock trades of Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and her spouse. Paul Pelosi has been a much-watched trader, but the California lawmaker's office said she personally does not own stock.",

      "In a joint statement, Hawley and Peters said the legislation, called the Honest Act, builds on an earlier bill and would ban members of Congress, the president, vice president and their spouses from holding, buying or selling stock. An earlier proposal from Hawley, named after Pelosi, had focused more narrowly on lawmakers.",
      "If the bill were to become law, it would immediately prohibit elected officials, including the president, from buying stocks and would ban them from selling stocks for 90 days after enactment. It also requires the elected officials to divest from all covered investments, but not until the beginning of their next term in office \u2014 shielding the term-limited president from that requirement.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity here today to do something that the public has wanted to do for decades,\u201d Hawley told the panel. \u201cAnd that is to ban members of Congress from profiting on information that frankly only members of Congress have on the buying and selling of stock.\u201d",

Rick Scott of Florida proposed one amendment that would exempt the president, the vice president, their spouses and dependent children from the legislation, and the other one that would have required a report on the Pelosi family\u2019s trades. Both were defeated, with Hawley joining the Democrats.",

      "It\u2019s too early for the board to identify what exactly caused the crash. The board\u2019s final report won\u2019t be released until sometime next year. But it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The January incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.",
      "\u201cThis is the very event that this would have been the cautionary note for,\u201d she said.",
      "Video and animation presented during the proceeding's first day showed the helicopter flying above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit before colliding with the plane.",
      "Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn\u2019t exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings.",
      "Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn\u2019t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them.",
      "Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk\u2019s altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet.",

      "The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.",
      "\u201cAll aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States.",
      "But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",
      "And they won Round One.",
      "In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "Now it goes on to Round Two.",
      "On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",
      "That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump\u2019s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system.",
      "The issues are so weighty \u2014 involving the president\u2019s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad \u2014 that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",
      "Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019\u2019 pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes \u2014 including tariffs \u2014 to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

The emergency he cited was America's long-running trade deficit.",
      "Trump later suspended the reciprocal tariffs, but they remain a threat: They could be imposed again Friday on countries that do not pre-empt them by reaching trade agreements with the United States or that receive letters from Trump setting their tariff rates himself.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that the emergency power laws does not authorize the use of tariffs. They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u2019\u2019 threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits \u2014 in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them \u2014 for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.",
      "The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.",

      "Meta\u2019s artificial intelligence spending spree appears to be paying off with investors, who sent the company\u2019s stock soaring after hours on Wednesday following a blowout quarterly earnings report.",
      "The Menlo Park, California-based company easily beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the second quarter, helped by higher advertising revenue and a growing user base on its flagship social media platforms. The money is helping to fund the company's massive investments in AI development and hiring top talent at eye-popping compensation levels.",
      "\u201cNot only has Meta made demonstrable strides with AI, but it\u2019s helping to future proof itself as a growth company, should its family of apps get affected by the current anti-trust case or changing social media sentiment,\u201d said Forrester research director Mike Proulx.",
      "Meta is facing an antitrust case that's now awaiting a judge's decision and could force the company to break off WhatsApp and Instagram, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The company earned $18.34 billion, or $7.14 per share, in the April-June period. That's up 36% from $13.47 billion, or $5.16 per share, in the same period a year earlier.",
      "Revenue jumped 22% to $47.52 billion from $39.07 billion.",
      "Analysts expected Meta to earn $5.88 per share on revenue of $44.81 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "Meta's daily active user base on its apps \u2014 Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads \u2014 was 3.48 billion, up 6% year-over-year.",
      "Meta said it expects costs to increase as it spends billions on infrastructure and luring highly compensated employees as it works on its AI ambitions. It's forecasting 2025 expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, up 20% to 24% year-over-year.",

      "The abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d is what rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI. It's the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company\u2019s name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",

We believe in putting this power in people\u2019s hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cThis is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The biggest event in harness racing celebrates a centennial anniversary this weekend with the 100th running of the Hambletonian",
      "Growing up in a family of horsemen in Ontario, John Campbell knew how prestigious the Hambletonian was. Then he saw good friend Ray Remmen win the first to take place at the Meadowlands in 1981.",
      "\u201cIt was beyond a big deal,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt was something special.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the biggest event in harness racing celebrates a centennial anniversary with the 100th running of Hambletonian. While harness racing, like its thoroughbred equivalent, no longer holds the same prominence it once did in the U.S. sporting landscape, the storied history of the Hambletonian and its evolution to grow interest in Europe are responsible for its longevity.",
      "\u201cTo have this big event still going on 100 years, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t even envision when it was formed,\u201d said Campbell, a Harness Racing Hall of Fame driver who won the Hambletonian a record six times and participated a record 32 consecutive times from 1983-2014. \u201cIt's the consistency of it. They raced it no matter what, through the Depression, through World War II, so it was always there.\u201d",
      "Campbell is now president and CEO of the Hambletonian Society that has shepherded the race named for the founding sire of standardbred horses through changing times. The purse is the sport's richest at $1 million, a long way from the nearly $75,000 on the line during the inaugural rendition in 1926 at the New York State Fair in Syracuse.",
      "The Hambletonian bounced around to Lexington, Kentucky; Goshen, New York and Du Quoin, Illinois, before finding a home in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cEven during the war, they did have to because of gas rationing take it to Yonkers,\u201d said Tom Charters, who worked at the Hambletonian Society from 1984-2017, including a lengthy stint as president. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the charm of it, I think: the multiple venues and where it\u2019s gone and where it\u2019s been.\u201d",
      "Another charm? The winning horse gets to drink out of the trophy. That is something Charters saw pictures of and made sure would become part of the Hambletonian ceremony \u2014 with the name of the race and the horse logo always facing the cameras.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become as symbolic as drinking milk at Indianapolis, for me, anyway,\u201d Charters said, referring to the Indy 500 tradition.",
      "Campbell has his favorite memories, notably, he said, \u201cWinning.\" His first victory with Mack Lobell in 1987 and winning with Tagliabue\u2014 trained by his brother, Jim, and named after longtime NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue \u2014 in '95 stand out as special, along with 2006 with Glidemaster to revitalize his career after injury.",
      "Chris McErlean, who worked at the Meadowlands from 1992-2007, remembers filly Continentalvictory beating the colts in \u201896, amateur Malvern Burroughs winning with Malabar Man in \u201997 and Swedish owner/trainer/driver Stefan Melander taking the race in 2000 with Scarlet Knight following efforts to encourage European participation.",

Fanning credits crossover horse betting from Saratoga Race Course and national television for keeping the event in the spotlight internationally, even though the on-track attendance is now expected to be 8,000-10,000.",
      "At its height in 2005, a crowd of 31,000 packed the old Meadowlands \u2014 and the current limit is roughly a third of that.",
      "\u201cHarness racing is a niche kind of regional sport. It has lost ground. Tracks have closed,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cRacing had a wonderful 200-year gambling monopoly that it no longer has, so it has taken a lot of work to keep it prominent and keep it on national TV and keep the big days big.\u201d",
      "Essentially the Kentucky Derby of the harness world, Fanning said the Hambletonian might be the one trotters race known in the mainstream public. Inside the industry, it remains a big deal and something special.",
      "\u201cEven though the sport in general\u2019s been challenged and it maybe is not at the peaks it used to be, the Hambletonian is still the biggest thing, the biggest prize out there,\u201d McErlean said. \u201cIt almost has as much international cache as it does prominence over here because of its longstanding history and being the richest race, being the biggest race on the calendar.\u201d",

      "Before he entered into a deal to sell a charter to Legacy, he already had an agreement with RFK to swap the charters currently in play and lease the other one to RFK in 2026. Then, in 2027, Ware planned to sell a charter outright to Legacy, which has a major investment from Knighthead Capital Management, a private equity firm worth over $13 billion.",

      "PORTHCAWL, Wales -- Rio Takeda overcame a double bogey at the turn with four birdies over her final seven holes Thursday for a 5-under 67 to share the lead with Eri Okayama in a Women's British Open that featured a Japanese surge and a mixed day for Lottie Woad.",
      "Japanese players held the top three spots at Royal Porthcawl, with Miyu Yamashita at 68. Three others were among the top 12 after an opening round in which the wind kept anyone from going low but about half the field was at par or better.",
      "Takeda, one of 20 players who have won on the LPGA Tour this year, took a double bogey on the par-5 ninth hole, only to rally over the closing hole to make up ground. Okayama, who plays the Japan LPGA, hit fairway metal to 12 feet on No. 17 for her final birdie.",
      "Woad started the month as the No. 1 amateur in women's golf. She won on the Ladies European Tour, missed a playoff by one shot in an LPGA major and then won the Women's Scottish Open against a strong field in her pro debut.",
      "She was the betting favorite at the final major of the year and did well to stay in the mix with a birdie on the par-5 18th for an even-par 72.",
      "Woad played alongside defending champion Lydia Ko (73) and Lilia Vu, a double major winner from two years ago, who had a 74.",
      "\u201cHad a good amount of birdies, just a few poor bogeys on the front nine that could have definitely been avoided,\u201d Woad said. \u201cNice to finish on par and birdie the last. It's one of those rounds that could have definitely gotten away from me. I am happy how I hung in there and got a decent round together.\u201d",
      "Nelly Korda, whose No. 1 ranking she has held for the last 16 months is in jeopardy, had an early bogey and kept a clean card the rest of the way, adding three birdies for a 70. Much like Woad, that round could have produced a much higher score if not for a series of key pars, none bigger than Korda's 12-footer on No. 16.",
      "\u201cSometimes you have to get lucky when you make the wrong decision. You kind of have to bail yourself out,\u201d said Korda, still looking for her first win this year after seven titles last season.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Atlanta Braves put five-time All-Star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. on the 10-day injured list with right Achilles tendon inflammation Wednesday, though the exact severity of the injury to the slugging outfielder may not be known until additional testing is done.",
      "The Braves recalled outfielder Jarred Kelenic from Triple-A Gwinnett to take his place on the roster.",
      "Acu\u00f1a first experienced discomfort in his calf area Monday night, when he scored from first on Austin Riley's double to help the Braves to a 10-7 victory over Kansas City. Acu\u00f1a lobbied to play on Tuesday night and Braves manager Brian Snitker assented, only for Acu\u00f1a to come up limping while trying to chase down a ball in right field in an eventual 9-6 loss.",
      "\u201cIt happened when I scored from first to home on that play,\u201d Acu\u00f1a explained after the game, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cThey are going to examine me (Wednesday) so we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d",
      "Even after he came up limping, Acu\u00f1a wanted to remain in the game. He headed out to his position in the field but saw Eli White trotting out to replace him. That Acu\u00f1a was able to jog into the dugout at least generated some optimism that the injury to the Achilles tendon was not a complete tear and he could be back this season.",
      "\u201cI was kind of out there hoping they wouldn\u2019t hit it my way and of course any time you do that, they always hit it your way,\" Acu\u00f1a said. \u201cI told them (about the pain Monday) and everyone said: \u2018Take the day if you want it.

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "While northeastern nights may seem brighter this summer, the bugs are still on the decline and they're waning at a faster rate than ever before.",
      "\u201cIt would be a mistake to say firefly populations are high this year, therefore there's no decline,\u201d said Matt Schlesinger with the New York Natural Heritage Program, who is part of an effort to count fireflies in state parks.",
      "Some firefly species could be doing well this year, Schlesinger said, while others are still on the decline.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticide use and light pollution are responsible. In cities, blaring lights from billboards, cars and storefronts can drown out the bugs' glow, making it harder for them to find their kin and pass their genes onto the next generation.",
      "Fireflies are part of the story of summer, said entomologist Jessica Ware with the American Museum of Natural History. Her children grew up seeing them flash in her backyard, but the bugs started to disappear once her kids hit their teenage years.",

      "The fictitious rock group, Velvet Sundown, which comes complete with AI-generated music, lyrics and album art, is stoking debate about how the new technology is blurring the line between the real and synthetic in the music industry, and whether creators should be transparent with their audience.",
      "Computer software is widely used in music production, and artificial intelligence is just the latest tool that disc jockeys, music producers and others have added to their production pipeline. But the rise of AI song generators such as Suno and Udio is set to transform the industry because they allow anyone to create songs with just a few prompts.",
      "While some people do not care whether they're listening to AI-generated music, others might be curious to know.",

      "The \u201cmost obvious cues\u201d come from \u201cexternal factors,\u201d said Manuel Mousallam, head of research and development at streaming service Deezer.",
      "Does the band or artist have social media accounts? Lack of a social presence might indicate there's no one there. If they do exist online, examine the kind of content they post, and how long it goes back.",
      "Is there any sign that the artist or band exists in real life? Are there any upcoming concerts and can you buy a ticket for a gig? Is there footage of past concerts on YouTube? Has an established record label released their singles or albums?",
      "Try going to the source. Song creators often \u2014 but not always \u2014 publish their generated tunes on the Suno or Udio platforms, where they can be found by other users.",
      "The catch is that you'll have to sign up for an account to get access. Users can look up songs by track name or the creator's handle, and browse genres and playlists. But it can still be difficult to spot a song, especially if you don't know the name of the song or creator.",
      "Deezer has been flagging albums containing AI-generated songs, as part of its efforts to be more transparent as it battles streaming fraudsters looking to make quick money through royalty payments.",

      "As a cross-check, I also uploaded some old MP3s from my song library, which got a very low AI probability score.",

      "Casual users, though, might prefer to just let the machine write them. So bad rhyming schemes or repetitive lyrical structures might be a clue that a song is not man-made. But it's subjective.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A 12-year-old boy died from a brain-eating amoeba two weeks after a holiday weekend on a popular South Carolina lake.",
      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",
      "Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn\u2019t closed and no water testing was performed.",
      "\u201cMy son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,\u201d Carr said.",

      "There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.",
      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",
      "\u201cMy son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,\u201d Carr said.",
      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That\u2019s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria \u2014 also referred to as blue-green algae \u2014 are plant-like organisms that live in water.",
      "The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.",
      "The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or \u201cbloom,\" in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.",
      "Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Yes, you read right, your passwords will be DELETED this Friday.",

      "When big infrastructure projects spring up, one crucial law \u2014 the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 has for decades been a key way the government has required powerful industry interests to consider the environment and the public\u2019s voice",
      "When President Donald Trump rolled out a plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers, a key goal was wiping away barriers to rapid growth.",
      "And that meant taking aim at the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 a 55-year-old, bedrock law aimed at protecting the environment through a process that requires agencies to consider a project's possible impacts and allows the public to be heard before a project is approved. Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure. Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",
      "Trump's administration has been weakening the law for months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien, who later worked at the Grand Canyon Trust, also co-chaired a working group that weighed in on a 2012 Forest Service proposal, finalized in 2016, for aspen restoration on Monroe Mountain in Utah. Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "Fishing for krill near Antarctica has surged to a record high, nearing a seasonal catch limit that could close the fishery early",
      "MIAMI -- Trawling near Antarctica for krill \u2014 a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming \u2014 has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",
      "Then they watch.",
      "The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence.",
      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",
      "\u201cNo other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively\" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project.",
      "Still, Congram warns, technology \u201cis not a panacea.\u201d",
      "\u201cNinety percent of searches are resolved with a good witness and digging,\u201d he said.",
      "Silv\u00e1n walks by a site where scientists buried 14 pigs about two years ago. He says they may not know how well the technology works, where and when it can be used, or under what conditions, for at least three years.",
      "\u201cFlowers came up because of the phosphorous at the surface, we didn\u2019t see that last year,\u201d he said as he took measurements at one of the gravesites. \u201cThe mothers who search say that that little yellow flower always blooms over the tombs and they use them as a guide.\u201d",

      "Pigs and humans are closely related, famously sharing about 98% of DNA. But for the mapping project, the physical similarities also matter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, pigs resemble humans in size, fat distribution and the structure and thickness of skin.",
      "A big Colombian drone mounted with a hyperspectral camera flies over the pig burial site. Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t pure science,\u201d Silv\u00e1n said. \u201cIt is science and action. Everything learned has to be applied immediately, rather than wait for it to mature, because there\u2019s urgency.\u201d",
      "Researchers also employ thermal drones, laser scanners and other gadgets to register anomalies, underground movements and electrical currents. One set of graves is encased behind a pane of transparent acrylic, providing a window for scientists to observe the pigs\u2019 decomposition in real time.",
      "The Jalisco commission compares and analyzes flies, beetles, plants and soil recovered from the human and pig graves.",
      "Each grave is a living \u201cmicro ecosystem,\u201d said Tunuari Ch\u00e1vez, the commission's director of context analysis.",
      "Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silv\u00e1n and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a \u201cbody farm.\u201d They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat good is science or technology if it doesn\u2019t solve problems?\u201d he said.",
      "They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared.",
      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",
      "\u201cThe knowledge flows in both directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Maribel Cede\u00f1o, who has been looking for her missing brother for four years, said she believes the drones and other technology will be helpful.",
      "\u201cI never imagined being in this situation, finding bodies, becoming such an expert,\u201d she said of her quest.",
      "H\u00e9ctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support.",
      "Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",
      "Congram, the forensic scientist, said researchers are aware of the limitations of technology, but that \u201cyou always have to try, fail, fail again and keep trying.\u201d",

      "The Australian government has announced YouTube will be required to ensure account holders are at least 16 years old starting in December",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced YouTube will be among the social media platforms that must ensure account holders are at least 16-years-old from December, reversing a position taken months ago on the popular video-sharing service.",
      "YouTube was listed as an exemption in November last year when the Parliament passed world-first laws that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and X.",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells released rules Wednesday that decide which online services are defined as \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d and which avoid the age limit.",
      "The age restrictions take effect Dec. 10 and platforms will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for \u201cfailing to take responsible steps\u201d to exclude underage account holders, a government statement said. The steps are not defined.",
      "Wells defended applying the restrictions to YouTube and said the government would not be intimidated by threats of legal action from the platform\u2019s U.S. owner, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cThe evidence cannot be ignored that four out of 10 Australian kids report that their most recent harm was on YouTube,\u201d Wells told reporters, referring to government research. \u201cWe will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids.\u201d",
      "Children will be able to access YouTube but will not be allowed to have their own YouTube accounts.",

      "\u201cWe share the government\u2019s goal of addressing and reducing online harms. Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens. It\u2019s not social media,\u201d a YouTube statement said, noting it will consider next steps and engage with the government.",

      "\u201cPlatforms have to provide an alternative to providing your own personal identification documents to satisfy themselves of age,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThese platforms know with deadly accuracy who we are, what we do and when we do it. And they know that you\u2019ve had a Facebook account since 2009, so they know that you are over 16.\"",
      "Exempt services include online gaming, messaging, education and health apps. They are excluded because they are considered less harmful to children.",
      "The minimum age is intended to address harmful impacts on children including addictive behaviors caused by persuasive or manipulative platform design features, social isolation, sleep interference, poor mental and physical health, low life-satisfaction and exposure to inappropriate and harmful content, government documents say.",

      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet (9.5 kilometers) deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet (11 kilometers).",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",

      "The singer-songwriter and actor shared the diagnosis in a social media post.",
      "Music superstar Justin Timberlake has been diagnosed with Lyme disease.",
      "The singer-songwriter and actor shared the diagnosis with his fans in an Instagram post Thursday that reflected on the conclusion of his two-year Forget Tomorrow World Tour.",
      "\"As many of you know, I'm a pretty private person. But as I'm reflecting on the tour and festival tour -- I want to tell you a little bit about what's going on with me,\" Timberlake wrote.",
      "The singer, who shares two sons with wife Jessica Biel, wrote that he hesitated to share his diagnosis but decided to do so in hopes of being more transparent with his fans.",
      "\"If you've experienced this disease or know someone who has -- then you're aware: living with this can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically,\" Timberlake wrote. \"When I first got the diagnosis I was shocked for sure. But, at least I could understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness. I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going.\"",
      "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease that, if left untreated, can affect the joints, heart and nervous system, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Most cases of Lyme disease can be effectively treated with a 10- to 14-day course of antibiotics. However, in some cases, prolonged symptoms may persist after treatment, including fatigue, body aches, and difficulty with concentration or memory. This condition is sometimes referred to as Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, or PTLDS.",
      "Timberlake, 44, did not share further details of his diagnosis or treatment.",
      "The former *NSYNC member launched his Forget Tomorrow World Tour in April and performed his final show on Wednesday in Turkey.",
      "In February, Timberlake canceled his final U.S. show of the tour just hours before he was set to take the stage in Columbus, Ohio, telling fans on social media that he was battling the flu.",
      "More recently, Timberlake faced criticisms from fans on the European leg of his tour, who accused him of singing too few of his songs live during his performance, and instead calling on the crowd to sing the lyrics.",
      "In revealing his Lyme disease diagnosis publicly, Timberlake wrote on social media that he was glad he continued his tour, despite the health struggles he faced.",
      "\"Not only did I prove my mental tenacity to myself but, I now have so many special moments with all of you that I will never forget,\" he wrote. \"I was reluctant to talk about this because I was always raised to keep something like this to yourself. But I am trying to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren't misinterpreted.\"",
      "What to know about Lyme disease",
      "Timberlake is not alone in battling Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., according to the CDC.",
      "Other celebrities who have spoken publicly about their struggles with the disease include comedian Amy Schumer, singers Shania Twain and Justin Bieber and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.",
      "The illness, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to humans via tick bites and is more likely to be contracted in the late spring, summer and fall. In most cases, the tick must be attached to the skin for at least 24 hours before the bacterium can be transmitted.",

      "Lyme disease is most commonly found in the Northeast and upper Midwest.",
      "The CDC recommends preventive measures such as treating your clothes and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin. They also recommend always doing a \"tick check\" after being outside and wearing insect repellent with Deet.",
      "Ticks can also come into the home through clothing and pets, so the CDC recommends checking pets for ticks and tumble drying clothes on high heat for 10 minutes after coming indoors to kill ticks.",
      "If you are ever in a situation where you are bitten by a tick, the CDC recommends tugging gently but firmly near the head of the tick until it is pulled away from the skin.",
      "People who are outdoors in areas that may have ticks should also conduct a full body check when they return, including checking under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, behind the knees, in and around the hair, between the legs and around the waist, the CDC says.",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reaction the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism for the American Eagle ad could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The discussion continued after eagle-eyed social media users noticed that Dunkin's promotion for its new summer drink features \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d co-star Gavin Casalengo attributing his suntan to genetics.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",

      "But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d",
      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",

      "Clear-air turbulence happens most often in or near the high-altitude rivers of air called jet streams. The culprit is wind shear, which is when two huge air masses close to each other move at different speeds. If the difference in speed is big enough, the atmosphere can\u2019t handle the strain, and it breaks into turbulent patterns like eddies in water.",

      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",

      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",
      "\u201cThis satellite data enables hurricane forecasters and their computer models to peer inside a hurricane\u2019s structure, offering vital insight,\" said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. \"Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.\u201d",
      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",

      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",

      "Massachusetts lawmakers are looking to approve a pay raise for public defenders in hopes of ending a legal crisis",
      "BOSTON -- Lawmakers in Massachusetts have reached a deal to give public defenders a pay raise in hopes of ending a legal crisis that led to cases being dropped and defendants who couldn't get lawyers being released from jail.",
      "But the deal was widely criticized by private attorneys who handle a bulk of cases for indigent clients, raising doubts as to whether the pay raise will be enough to end a work stoppage public defenders launched in May.",
      "The stoppage has led to more than 120 cases being dropped, including some for serious crimes such as domestic abuse and assaulting a police officer. Dozens more defendants were released from jail because they had no legal counsel. As many as 3,000 defendants have been without attorneys.",
      "The deal lawmakers will vote on Thursday calls for spending $40 million to double the number of attorneys who work for the state Committee for Public Counsel Services and allows for hiring 320 more public defenders by the end of fiscal 2027. It also would raise the hourly rate paid to private attorneys who work as public defenders by $20 an hour over two years, a 30% increase.",
      "The committee's chief counsel, Anthony Benedetti, applauded the proposed funding increase and called it \u201cthe most significant progress ever made toward improving Bar Advocate pay and strengthening the statewide right to counsel.\u201d",
      "But Sean Delaney, speaking at press conference surrounded by private attorneys who handle a bulk of the cases, said the plan was inadequate and called on lawmakers to reject it. Many advocates, he said, would continue refusing new cases unless their rates are increased $35 an hour in fiscal year 2026 and $25 an hour the year after.",
      "The challenges were on display in a Boston courtroom last week, when case after case was dropped due to the \u201cLavallee protocol.\u201d It requires cases be dropped if a defendant hasn\u2019t had an attorney for 45 days and that the defendants be released from custody if they haven\u2019t had representation for seven days.",

      "CHICAGO -- A Peruvian survivor of clergy sex abuse brought her public campaign for reforms to the American hometown of Pope Leo XIV on Thursday, saying he failed in investigating her case when he was a bishop in her home country and needs to step up now as leader of the world\u2019s Catholics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been quiet since the pope has been elected,\u201d Ana Mar\u00eda Quispe D\u00edaz said in Spanish at a news conference in downtown Chicago. \u201cBut I\u2019m not planning to be quiet forever.\u201d",
      "She appeared with members of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. The advocacy group sent a letter to the pope on Thursday renewing demands for more accountability on clergy sex abuse complaints and released documents related to D\u00edaz's case.",
      "The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly, as D\u00edaz has. She began speaking out on social media in 2023, and has faced threats and harassment in Peru because of it, SNAP officials said.",
      "Ahead of Leo\u2019s May election, SNAP filed a formal complaint against then-Cardinal Robert Prevost with the Vatican secretary of state, alleging he abused ecclesiastical power in his handling of two cases.",
      "D\u00edaz said she is a victim in one of those cases which overlapped with Prevost\u2019s tenure as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru. According to the complaint filed in March by SNAP, Prevost's diocese didn't fully investigate in April 2022 when three women accused priests Eleuterio V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1les and Ricardo Yesqu\u00e9n of sexually abusing them as minors.",
      "D\u00edaz said Thursday that she had spoken briefly with Prevost on the phone in 2020, telling him how she was abused by V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1les, but wasn't given assurances that much could be done. All three women spoke with Prevost in person in 2022 about both priests, according to D\u00edaz.",
      "\u201cHow much more damage can he do now that he is the pope?\" she asked, speaking through a translator.",
      "But Prevost did everything he was supposed to do, according to the Chiclayo diocese and Vatican, including restricting the priest\u2019s ministry, sending a preliminary investigation to the Vatican\u2019s sex crimes office, offering the victims psychological help and suggesting they go to authorities, who archived the case because it happened too long ago.",
      "Pope Francis had a mixed record on responding to the clergy sexual abuse crisis, bungling a major case in Chile in 2018 before reversing course, ordering an investigation and apologizing to the victims. Ultimately, it became a turning point for how he directed the church to handle cases of priests sexually abusing children for the rest of his papacy.",
      "In these cases, the Vatican investigation found Prevost acted correctly in imposing preliminary restrictions on V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1les while Peruvian authorities conducted their own civil investigation. The Vatican office archived the case for lack of evidence, then reopened it in 2023 after it gained traction in the media.",
      "Victims\u2019 groups are demanding an accounting from Leo. Meanwhile, his supporters say the Chiclayo case is being exploited by his opponents to undermine him after he made enemies by helping shut down Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a scandal-plagued lay Catholic community in Peru.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple shook off a thicket of tariffs and a botched entry into artificial intelligence to accelerate its revenue growth during its springtime quarter, but the trendsetting tech company still faces a bumpy road ahead that could lead to higher iPhone prices.",
      "The April-June results released Thursday came against a backdrop of adversity that has been raising worries about the trajectory of a longtime tech kingpin that expects to absorb a setback of nearly $2 billion from the tariffs that President Donald Trump has already imposed and others in the pipeline.",
      "Despite the doubts, Apple remains a moneymaking machine.",
      "The Cupertino, California, company earned $23.4 billion, or $1.57 per share, during its fiscal third quarter, a 9% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 10% from a year ago to $94 billion. The company\u2019s iPhone sales surged 13% from a year ago to $44.6 billion. In another positive development, Apple's business in China showed signs of snapping out of a prolonged malaise with a 4% bump in revenue from the same time last year.",
      "All those numbers were well above the analyst projections that steer investors, helping to boost Apple\u2019s recently slumping stock price by about 3% in extended trading. But the unexpectedly solid performance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s smooth sailing ahead for Apple.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war targeting foreign-made products such as the iPhone and Apple\u2019s stumbling start in the pivotal transition to AI is causing investors to question if the company will remain at the tech forefront as the industry moves into a new era.",
      "Before Thursday\u2019s report came out, Apple\u2019s stock price had plunged by 17% so far this year to wipe out more than $600 billion in shareholder wealth and knock the company off its perch as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Meanwhile, the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia have surged 32% this year and the shares of AI pacesetter Microsoft have gained 27%, propelling the market value to $4 trillion.",
      "Even though Apple remains highly profitable, the tariffs that Trump has already imposed on China and other countries cost the company $800 million during the past quarter, and CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a conference call that the fees would exact an additional toll of $1.1 billion during the July-September period.

      "Apple softened the blow of Trump\u2019s tariffs on products made outside the U.S. during the past quarter by shifting its production of iPhones from China to India. But the administration intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, a move that could intensify the pressure on Apple to raise the prices on the next generation of iPhones expected to be released in September. Cook wasn't asked about the possibility of an iPhone increase during his Thursday remarks to analysts.",
      "Consumer fears about the tariffs driving up iPhone prices spurred an unusual buying spree of iPhones and Mac computers in the U.S. during early April, according to Cook. Apple estimated that spike accounted for roughly one percentage point of its 10% revenue increase in the past quarter, which translates into about $82 million in sales. Cook also credited an uptick in consumers upgrading to the latest model for helping Apple sell its 3 billionth iPhone since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Apple to make all its iPhones in the U.S., a move that analysts believe would take years to pull off and ultimately double or triple the roughly $1,000 average price of the device. But Cook told analysts Thursday that the company is pushing to increase its computer chip production in the U.S. as one way of avoiding tariffs. \u201cWe ultimately will do more in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple is still trying to fulfill the AI promises it made last year when it unveiled an array of new iPhone features built on the revolutionary technology, raising expectations that the shift would spur millions of people to upgrade their old devices. But Apple still hasn\u2019t delivered on an AI upgrade that was supposed to smarten up its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri, one of the main reasons underlying the lackluster growth of iPhone sales.",
      "\u201cWhile these numbers certainly buy Apple time, the fact is that investors \u2014 and consumers \u2014 remain laser-focused on AI innovation. And Apple still has a long way to go in this game,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.",

      "Two wildfires burning in the western United States are so hot that they\u2019re spurring the formation of \u201cfire clouds\u201d that can create their own erratic weather systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Two wildfires burning in the western United States \u2014 including one that has become a \u201cmegafire\u201d on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon \u2014 are so hot that they\u2019re spurring the formation of \u201cfire clouds\u201d that can create their own erratic weather systems.",
      "In Arizona, the wind-whipped wildfire that destroyed the Grand Canyon Lodge is 9% contained and has charred more than 164 square miles (424.7 square kilometers) to become the largest fire now burning in the continental U.S.",
      "Another large fire in Monroe, Utah, has burned 75 square miles (194 square kilometers) since July 13 and is 11% contained, officials said Thursday. Evacuation orders were issued Wednesday for several towns in the fire's path, and scorched power poles caused electricity to be shut off in other nearby communities in south-central Utah.",
      "Towering convection clouds known as pyrocumulus clouds have been spotted over Arizona's blaze for seven consecutive days, fueling the fire with dry, powerful winds, fire information officer Lisa Jennings said. They form when air over the fire becomes super-heated and rises in a large smoke column. The billowing clouds can be seen for hundreds of miles and look like a dark spear jutting into the atmosphere.",
      "Their more treacherous big brother, a fire-fueled thunderstorm known as the pyrocumulonimbus cloud, sent rapid winds shooting out in all directions this week as a smoke column formed from the Utah fire then collapsed on itself, said fire team information officer Jess Clark.",
      "\u201cIf they get high enough, they can also create downdrafts and that\u2019s something we really watch out for because that can quickly spread the fire and can be very dangerous for firefighters who are doing their work on the ground,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Multiple fire crews in Utah were forced to retreat Wednesday as the unpredictable climate created by the clouds threatened their safety.",
      "The same type of cloud, which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has dubbed the \u201cfire-breathing dragon of clouds,\u201d recently formed a fire tornado that tore through an eastern Utah neighborhood with wind speeds estimated at 122 miles (196 kilometers) per hour.",
      "\u201cThink of the fire as kind of like a hot air balloon, so it adds buoyancy and things rise as a result,\" said Derek Mallia, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Utah who studies pyrocumulonimbus clouds and tracks fires in Utah and Arizona. \u201cYou get this towering thunderstorm over the fire, and just like any other thunderstorm it gets really windy underneath it. Because it\u2019s the West, these thunderstorms tend to be very dry.\u201d",
      "The Dragon Bravo Fire burning on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon was sparked by lightning on July 4. It was about a week later that conditions deteriorated, with hot, dry and windy weather helping to push the flames toward the Grand Canyon Lodge and the historic cabins that surround it. The fire destroyed dozens of buildings and forced the closure of the national park\u2019s North Rim for the rest of the season as hundreds of firefighters struggled to gain an upper hand.",
      "Thursday marked the eighth straight day of historically dry conditions, Jennings said. Humidity levels have been in the single digits, fuel moisture levels are extremely low and wind gusts were expected to crank up to 35 miles per hour (54.7 kilometers per hour).",
      "The pyrocumulus clouds have reached heights of at least 25000 feet (7620 meters), and fire behavior analyst Arthur Gonzales said they could go higher.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-feinstein-on-passing-his-love-of-great-songs-to-the-next-generation/",
    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated star of \"The English Patient\" and \"Slow Horses\" has directed and co-written her first film: the heartfelt \"My Mother's Wedding,\" about three daughters who come together to attend their mom's third nuptials \u2013 a story inspired by Thomas' own childhood losses.",
    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all! Keep it coming!'\"",

    "summary": "It took the art world decades to recognize Louise Nevelson, whose monochromatic and immersive sculptures, often incorporating found objects, verged on the monumental.",
    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

    "story": [
      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that it doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",

He appeared with his medical team, including representatives from CU Anschutz and UCHealth, to discuss his outlook and that he is considered \"cancer-free.\"",
      "Sanders' doctor confirmed that his bladder was removed after the cancer diagnosis and they proceeded with the creation of a new bladder. She also said that Sanders is currently cancer-free.",
      "\"We removed the tumor. It was very high-grade and invading through the bladder wall. Not into the muscle layer, something we call very high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer,\" said Dr. Janet Kukreja with CU Cancer Center at the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.",
      "Sanders appeared in good spirits at the 40-minute long news conference, wearing a cowboy hat and overalls along with his signature sunglasses.",
      "\"It has been a tremendous journey,\" said Sanders as he became emotional. \"God is good... God is good... You have no idea how good God has been for me to be here.\"",
      "\"I never once in this journey said, 'God, why me?'\"",
      "Sanders said that no one knew about his cancer diagnosis, not even the team. He also said he will remain in his position as head coach for the football team.",
      "\"So, I don't mind going through the afflications that I go through because I know the result and we're helping some folks today. There are some folks right now calling the doctors to schedule checkups, and there are some wives out there saying, 'Baby, I told you,' \" said Sanders. \"Because if it can happen to Prime, it can happen to you.\"",
      "Kukreja said Sanders' outlook was \"very good\" and that they would keep him on surveillance with routine scans.",
      "She said that new bladders are created for patients using their own intestines.",
      "\"At the University of Colorado UCHealth, we usually do the procedure robotically, so it's a laparoscopic surgery where we attach a robot to the patient and then we do all the maneuvering of the robot. And once the bladder comes out, we also take some lymph nodes to make sure that it hasn't spread, and it didn't, and then we make a new bladder for people,\" said Kukreja.",
      "Laparoscopic surgery is described as a surgical technique that uses a thin tube with a camera, to view and operate on internal organs through small incisions in the abdomen.",
      "There has been speculation about his health after he hadn't been seen in public for some time after the end of spring practice in April. Sanders took to social media last month to say that he was OK.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:01:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately. Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, too.",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

    "summary": "Millions of borrowers in forbearance through the SAVE plan will see interest start accruing on Friday. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting on Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

      "Harry Root, owner of Grassroots Wine, in Charleston, South Carolina, which distributes domestic and imported wines to restaurants and retailers, said the new levies on goods from the 27-country EU will leave him no choice but to raise prices for his clients, which he said are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers.",
      "\"We have to increase prices because when the container of wine I've ordered lands, I have to pay 100% of whatever the tariff is on that wine,\" Root said on Wednesday at a U.S. Wine Trade Alliance (USWTA) roundtable on the impact of the new U.S. tariffs on the EU.",
      "Higher prices for imported wines will also raise the cost of wine produced in the U.S. as consumers shift to domestic labels and drive up demand, according to USWTA President Ben Aneff.",
      "\"Econ 101 will tell you that higher-cost imported products will also mean higher prices for domestic products,\" Aneff said at the roundtable. \"So you'd expect a big drop in demand, higher prices, lower choice for consumers. It's a problem.\"",
      "Max Rohn, CEO of Long Island, New York-based Wolffer Estate winery, put it bluntly.",
      "\"We want people to drink wine, and tariffs will make them drink less wine,\" he said during the USWTA event.",
      "A trade group representing Italian winemakers, Unioni Vini Italiani, is warning that a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. could cost around $15 after the 15% EU tariff kicks in.",

      "Higher costs for a wee dram",
      "A 10% American\u00a0levy on the U.K. under a trade deal announced in May could also push up liquor costs for U.S. consumers. Drew McKenzie Smith, founder and managing director of Fife, Scotland-based Lindores Abbey Distillery, told CBS MoneyWatch that the tariff on shipments to the U.S. could force him to hike the price of a bottle of scotch by an equivalent amount.",
      "\"We had hoped to shoulder that cost because if you put your whisky up too much, then people won't buy it. But to cover that, it means we'd have to add 10% to the price of a bottle, so it's a tricky one,\" he said, noting that a bottle of Abbey Distillery scotch that currently retails for about $86 could rise to about $94.",
      "In 2024, the U.K. exported 132 million bottles of scotch whisky to the U.S., according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research firm that is tracking the effects of tariffs on food and beverage costs in the U.S, said that the wine and spirits business is more exposed to tariffs because consumers are less likely to switch to domestic substitutes.",
      "\"It's a little different when you're assessing the impact on prices related to wine and spirits compared to other goods because consumers have certain tastes and preferences,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Meanwhile, unlike with some industries, which may be able to relocate factories from abroad to the U.S., wine production can't be reshored.",
      "\"You can't produce French wine in the U.S. because then it ceases to be French wine,\" he said. \"If consumers have a strong preference for a particular bottle, they'll continue to buy it.\"",
      "Added Aneff of the USWTA, \"Wines from one place are not fungible for wines from another. It's a different product.\"",
      "Lobbying for relief",
      "Trade groups for both European and domestic wine producers are lobbying for exemptions from the 15% tariffs on most EU goods, citing the potential for substantial losses on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Unione Italiana Vini said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that the 15% tariff would result in a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the finalized deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "The USWTA is also urging U.S. trade officials to include wine in its list of exempted goods under the new U.S.-EU trade deal.",
      "\"We are heartened that negotiations are leaving room for wine to be included under the zero-for-zero exemption structure,\" Aneff said in a statement. \"Now is the time to ensure wine is prioritized in the final agreement.\"",
      "Addressing the EU tariff agreement, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger\u00a0said\u00a0the group is also \"optimistic that in the days ahead this positive meeting and agreement will lead to a return to zero-for-zero tariffs for U.S. and EU spirits products.\"",
      "Peril for restaurants",
      "The stepped up U.S. tariffs on the EU wouldn't just hurt consumers \u2014 they could also lead to the loss of thousands of jobs at manufacturers and distributors, according to industry experts. Restaurants, which depend on sales of European wines to buoy them financially, also could feel the impact in the form of slimmer profits.",
      "Typically, if a restaurant pays $15 for a bottle of wine from France or Italy, the two largest exporters to the U.S., it will charge patrons $15 a glass, Aneff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Their margin is five times the cost of the bottle,\" he said. \"And for a restaurant that's not a luxury \u2014 it's an absolute necessity.\"",

      "In his Thursday social media post, the president said he agreed to a 90-day extension during a phone conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he described as \"very successsful.\"",
      "The president has turned to tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he says are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to strike new trade deals with Mexico and many other nations, the Trump administration has announced trade deals with\u00a0five Asian countries, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.",

      "Many economists project that tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices because the import duties are paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, which then pass on some or all of the costs to shoppers.

      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate.

That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

      "Zuckerberg's vision of the future also involves something else: glasses. Meta has teamed up with Ray Ban and other eyewear makers to develop AI glasses that let wearers make phone calls, take photos and handle other tasks.",
      "\"I think personal devices like glasses that can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our main computing devices,\" he said in a social media\u00a0video on X discussing the new initiative.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "Mr. Trump in May ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong, which had allowed retailers like Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion.

    "story": [
      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon.

      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court.",

Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:40:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",

      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",

      "Asked about a tariff rate \"for the world,\" as Mr. Trump put it, the president responded, \"I would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range.\" The U.S. president made the remarks seated alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, as Mr. Trump visits his golf courses there and meets with European leaders.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. have already reached a trade agreement, and over the weekend, after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders announced a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU.",
      "A Trump administration deadline of Aug. 1 for other countries to reach trade deals with the U.S. is rapidly approaching. Without an individual deal, Mr. Trump says most countries' products will see a flat tariff rate.",
      "\"I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding, \"probably one of those two numbers.\"",
      "But as recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump floated a higher range, between 15% and 50%. Mr. Trump, who in April said the U.S. had 200 trade deals with other nations, has since said there are too many countries for individual trade deals with all of them and the U.S. will have \"simple\" tariffs for \"most\" countries.",
      "\"We have over 200 countries, people don't realize, that's a lot of, that's a lot of deals ... that would be too much for anybody,\" the president said Wednesday.",

      "\"It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties,\" the president said.",
      "The deal, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, is a 15% tariff across the board. She praised Mr. Trump, calling it a \"good deal\" and a \"huge deal\" that followed \"tough negotiations.\"",
      "\"We have a deal. We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" she said. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said, \"I think we both wanted to make a deal,\" and he predicted it would \"bring us closer together.\" Mr. Trump also said more than once to reporters Sunday that it was the \"biggest of all the deals.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the negotiations addressed the EU's trade surplus with the U.S., and the deal would be carried out in a way that would enable trade to continue while jobs on \"both sides of the Atlantic\" would be rebalanced.",
      "According to Mr. Trump, the deal also includes that all European Union countries will be \"opened up for U.S. goods\" at 0% and the bloc will invest $600 billion in the U.S. The EU will also purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy as part of the deal.",
      "\"They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is--It's very substantial.\"",
      "In remarks before the session, Mr. Trump pledged to change what he characterized as \"a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.\"",
      "\"I think the main sticking point is fairness,\" he said while also noting, \"We've had a hard time with trade with Europe, a very hard time.\"",
      "Without a deal, Mr. Trump had threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly. Last year, the U.S. trade deficit with the EU was about $235 billion.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:01:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately. Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, too.",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending the legal status and deportation protections for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "While it could be suspended by a higher court, the ruling is a reprieve for more than 60,000 immigrants who had been previously allowed by the U.S. government to live and work in the country legally for years and in some cases, since the late 1990s, under the Temporary Protected Status program.",
      "Immigrants from Nepal enrolled in the TPS program were set to lose their legal status next week, on Aug. 5. TPS holders from Honduras and Nicaragua, meanwhile, were slated to see their work permits and deportation protections under the program expire in early September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ordered the planned TPS terminations for these countries to be postponed through at least Nov. 18, when she scheduled a hearing on the merits of a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision. Thompson said the delay could be extended beyond Nov. 18.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the Department of Homeland Security to offer a temporary safe haven \u2014 in the form of deportation deferrals and work authorization \u2014 to immigrants from countries beset by armed conflict, an environmental disaster or other crises.",
      "Those enrolled in TPS are generally immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally or who arrived legally on temporary visas and then applied for the humanitarian program.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, arguing that some of them are contrary to U.S. national interests and that they've been in place for too long, despite their temporary nature and improved conditions in the relevant countries.",
      "The administration, for example, has noted that the TPS programs for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch caused catastrophic floods and killed thousands in Central America. The TPS program for Nepal was announced in 2015, after an earthquake hit the small Asian country. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said all three countries have recovered from those environmental disasters.",
      "But Thompson, the San Francisco-based federal judge, said the TPS holders who sued the Trump administration were likely to succeed in their arguments that Noem's decisions were \"preordained\" actions that did not fully consider lingering conditions in Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "Thompson, who was appointed by former President Biden, also found the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in arguing that Noem's decisions were \"motivated by racial animus.\" Thompson cited statements by Noem that she said stereotyped the TPS program and associated immigrants with criminality.",
      "The judge also referenced a comment made by President Trump during the 2024 campaign in which he said migrants entering the U.S. illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"",
      "\"The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a request to comment on Thursday's court order, including on the judge's suggestion that the TPS terminations were linked to racial animus.",
      "According to official government statistics, there are 72,000 Hondurans, 12,700 Nepalis and 4,000 Nicaraguans enrolled in the TPS policy. Some of them, however, have been able to gain green cards, or lawful permanent U.S. residency, including 21,000 of the Honduran TPS holders. An estimated 5,500 and 1,100 TPS holders from Nepal and Nicaragua, respectively, have also become permanent residents, according to government data.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, his administration has announced plans to terminate TPS for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including Afghans, Cameroonians, Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "Federal courts have blocked some of those terminations, but the Supreme Court allowed the administration to revoke the TPS protections of more than 300,000 Venezuelans.",

      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended how the Supreme Court is handling an unprecedented number of emergency appeals from the Trump administration, saying that as presidents push the limits of their power, courts will have to respond.",
      "Speaking before a group of lawyers and judges Thursday in Kansas City, Missouri, Kavanaugh said presidents in both parties, stymied by inaction in Congress, have relied more on executive orders \"to get things done.\" That's led to more legal challenges, Kavanaugh said, which inevitably draw in the Supreme Court to determine whether the new regulation can take effect, at least temporarily, while the legal challenges play out.",
      "So far, the court has been inclined to say yes, agreeing to allow a number of President Trump's high-profile executive orders to take effect while the lower courts review the merits, such as orders to fire members of independent federal agencies, freeze certain federal grants and plan layoffs at nearly every federal agency.",
      "Asked about criticism that the court isn't doing enough to explain its reasoning in some of those emergency cases, Kavanaugh said the court has written more than it has in the past. He said the court also had made some internal changes in the past five or six years \"to try to get the right answer,\" including scheduling emergency oral arguments, as in the recent case challenging nationwide injunctions.",
      "He said he was a \"fan of more process\" and mentioned two recent cases, including the president's removal power in independent agencies, where he unsuccessfully urged the court to step in and decide the underlying issue before it went through the lower courts.",
      "Kavanaugh's hour-long remarks came in a conversation with U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk, one of his former law clerks, at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit's judicial conference. It's one of several judicial conferences this summer that will feature different justices.",
      "Last week, Justice Elena Kagan spoke to the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where she urged the court to be more cautious with its handling of the so-called emergency docket. She also said that while she finds some of the court's recent decisions \"frustrating\" and \"sometimes even maddening,\" prompting fierce dissents, she believed her colleagues were \"all operating in good faith.\"",
      "Kavanaugh shared a similar sentiment about the other justices, saying even in disagreement, \"they're thoughtfully engaging in difficult issues,\" and he believed it was \"a sign of strength when there are different views expressed.\"",
      "\"The collegiality of the Supreme Court is very strong, strong to this day,\" he said. \"We all look out for each other. We think the other eight are patriots and are good people.\"",
      "His wide-ranging conversation with Pitlyk was at times personal and humorous, touching on everything from lessons he's taken from sports to some of his favorite opinions in recent terms. He said he's aware of criticism of the court, but that \"criticism is part of the job.\"",
      "Like the referees for high school sports, Kavanaugh said, as a justice, \"you have to recognize and know thick skin and criticism comes with the territory.\"",
      "\"Did you ever walk out of a game and say, 'our team lost, but the refs were great?'\" Kavanaugh said, to laughter from the audience. \"That informs my judging, too.\"",
      "Jan Crawford is CBS News' chief legal correspondent and a recognized authority on the Supreme Court.

      "Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.",
      "Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.",
      "\"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added.",
      "Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said.",
      "Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.",
      "Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.",
      "Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported. The tally is still far short of the 1 million annual deportations Trump officials have said they're targeting.",

    "story": [
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has implemented heavy sanctions on Iranian industries, including trying to stop tankers used to transfer Iranian oil to China, which could help fund Iranian nuclear development programs. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions, which Washington called the most extensive action of its kind since 2018.",
      "Recently, a CBS News crew set off from Singapore, one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, to head more than 80 nautical miles away in international waters to see how the \"dark fleet\" operates.",
      "\"As long as there's a supply, there will be a demand for this discounted oil,\" said Charlie Brown, a former U.S. Navy officer who's now a senior adviser with United Against Nuclear Iran, who is advising the U.S. government.",
      "The supply is Iran, the demand is China, and this mutually beneficial relationship, which has long angered the United States, plays out off the coast of Malaysia in the Riau archipelago, an area the size of New York City.",
      "\"This is 'dark fleet' parking central,\" said Brown, who's been monitoring the \"dark fleet\" for years.",
      "He described one ship, the Tifani, as \"a well-known 'dark fleet' tanker that's always been out here on a regular basis.\"",
      "The tankers, full of oil, sail from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Malacca to the Riau archipelago. There, they transfer the crude to ships bound for China, which buys 90% of Iran's oil.",
      "During the CBS News crew's journey, four ship-to-ship transfers were happening in plain sight.",
      "These \"dark fleet\" tankers \u2014 all with their transponders switched off \u2014   clearly do not want to be identified.",
      "\"Both ships have a net or something, a tarp, deployed over the stern, covering the name and identification number \u2014   it's obvious deceptive practice,\" Brown said.",
      "Further analysis revealed one ship was the elusive Stellar Oracle, laden with Iranian oil. It was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in May.",
      "Close by, another ship-to-ship transfer was underway involving the Alps \u2014   not its real name \u2014   filled with Iranian crude that was also sanctioned in May. The receiving vessel Eon, which is not on any list, was caught in the act \u2014   a new sanctions violator.",
      "According to a congressional report last year, this trade generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up the regime and its nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on this trade this year, but it's having little effect. China doesn't recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran and says that its trade with Iran is legitimate.",
      "By the end of the day, 12 ship-to-ship transfers were recorded in the Riau archipelago \u2014   an unprecedented number and a clear indication Iran and China are only ramping up this illicit activity.",

    "summary": "he NYPD said the gunman purchased the fully-assembled AR 15-style rifle used in the shooting from his supervisor.",
    "story": [
      "Shane Tamura, the gunman who drove from Las Vegas to Manhattan and opened fire in a New York City office building Monday and killed four people, was issued a concealed carry permit in Nevada, despite a documented history of mental health incidents.",
      "Sources said the gunman had at least two mental health incidents in 2022 and 2024. He was also arrested for trespassing in 2023. Law enforcement sources confirmed that he obtained the concealed carry permit in spring 2022.",
      "Tamura, 27, bought the fully assembled AR 15-style rifle for $1,400 from his supervisor at the Las Vegas casino where he worked.\u00a0 The NYPD said the supervisor's purchase of the rifle was legal, but it hasn't yet determined whether Tamura broke any law in buying it from him. The supervisor, Rick Ackley, complied with state and federal gun laws in the sale to Tamura, his attorney, Chris Rasmussen, said.",
      "The NYPD also said they found a handgun in Tamura's\u00a0car, which was purchased legally with the concealed carry permit in June from a gun store in Las Vegas. A tipster told law enforcement that same month that the shooter had purchased a large amount of ammunition and an aftermarket trigger.",
      "Second Amendment expert Ian Bartrum, an emeritus law professor at the University of Las Vegas, noted that while the circumstances of how the suspect bought the gun used in the New York mass shooting are murky, he was legally allowed to carry and transport it within the state under Nevada law.",
      "\"It's the Wild West,\" he said. Tamura's right to transport the weapon across state lines would have been subject to gun bans and other controls on the books in states he drove through, but so in practice, such restrictions would be difficult to enforce.",
      "It is illegal in New York to possess or transport assault-style weapons, but the state law is not designed to stop a shooter who drives into New York from out of state, as Tamura did.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called for a national assault weapon ban, posting on social media \"a gunman from a state with weak gun laws brought an AR-15 to New York.\"",
      "There has not been a national assault weapons ban in the U.S. since the last one expired in 2004. Former President Joe Biden, who was one of the architects of the 1994 ban, urged Congress to pass a new ban but lacked the political support for it. In 2022, Biden signed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun control legislation in three decades, which enhanced background checks for gun buyers under 21 years of age, provided billions for mental health services and closed the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" to prevent convicted domestic abusers from purchasing a firearm for five years.",
      "During his first term, President Trump signed a ban on bump stocks \u2014 which was later overturned by the Supreme Court, another indication of the challenges facing gun legislation. In 2022, the Supreme Court struck down a 108-year-old New York law that limited who can obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in public. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said New York's \"proper-cause requirement\" prevented law-abiding citizens from exercising their Second Amendment right, and held its licensing regime is unconstitutional.",
      "A May 2022 CBS News poll found 54% of Americans want stricter gun laws, while 30% want to keep the laws as they are and 16% want less strict laws. But passing any type of gun control legislation remains difficult, with CBS News polling in 2022 showing deep partisan divides among Americans on the issue. Even if Democrats, who largely support gun control measures, held majorities in Congress, they would likely need to win the support of Republican senators to secure the 60 votes necessary to allow the consideration of any such bill.",
      "Although Nevada has some libertarian characteristics, Bartrum said the state's gun laws are considered more middle of\u00a0 the road for the U.S. \u2014 even though\u00a0 Las Vegas suffered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, when a gunman opened fire on a music festival in 2017, killing 58 people and wounding nearly 500.",
      "Before the Las Vegas shooting, Nevada voters approved a ballot initiative for background checks, which then-state Attorney General Adam Laxalt declared enforceable. But Nevada's state government in 2019 ushered in new gun control measures, including background checks on private sales and transfers and some \"red flag\" legislation, according to the Nevada Independent. Under red-flag laws, courts can issue orders for the seizure of guns from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.",
      "Bartrum said that there has been \"pretty broad bipartisan support for even things like background checks,\" which he described as \"not particularly controversial or onerous.\" But he noted that it has been nearly impossible to enact new gun legislation.",
      "\"Despite that the technology is ever moving forward, the law is sort of stuck in 1865,\" he said. \"So it's a pretty, pretty \u2026 illogical system of regulation.\"",

      "Asked about it by reporters later in the day, Mr. Trump said, \"We've been planning it for a long time.\" He said the new ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building,\" which he called his \"favorite place.\"",
      "\"It won't be\u2014 it'll be near it, but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "According to a release from the Trump administration, the ballroom will be approximately 90,000 square feet of \"innately designed and carefully crafted space\" with a capacity for 650 people sitting down, an increase from 200 people in the East Room of the White House.",
      "It's unclear who the donors are as well as how the architects were chosen. The White House said McCrery Architects will be the lead architect, Clark Construction will oversee the construction and the engineering team will be led by AECOM.",
      "Construction is set to begin in September. The White House said Mr. Trump has held several meetings over the past few weeks with members of the White House staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office and the Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.",
      "\"The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it's theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,\" the White House said in a release. \"The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942.\"",
      "After the announcement, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked, \"Where'd this money come from? Did Congress appropriate it? I don't think so.\"",

      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most well-known sex trafficking accusers, expressed shock after President Trump said Giuffre was one of the employees Epstein \"stole\" from the spa at the president's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "Giuffre, who had accused Britain's Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year.",
      "\"It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been 'stolen' from Mar-a-Lago,\" the family's statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump, responding to a reporter's question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers, including Giuffre, from his Palm Beach, Florida, club.",
      "The statement from Giuffre's family is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Mr. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case.",
      "Mr. Trump's comment \"makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions,\" the family's statement said. Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida, is the one \"who targeted and preyed upon\" then 16-year-old Giuffre in 2000, the family said.",

      "A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family's statement was sent to Maxwell's attorney Thursday.",
      "A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates.",
      "Giuffre called Maxwell \"the mastermind\" behind the alleged sex trafficking in an interview with CBS News' Gayle King in 2020.",
      "\"She is a monster. She's worse than Epstein. She did things even worse than Epstein did. She was vicious. She was evil. And she's a woman,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Giuffre also told King that Maxwell could incriminate \"very well-known\" people.",
      "Giufree previously said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old.

      "Their visit is prompted by a dire humanitarian crisis, as children and adults in Gaza are struggling to survive off insufficient food and the death toll for people trying to get aid in Gaza mounts.

The special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",

      "A U.S. Marshals Service official told CBS News in May the agency \u2014 which handles judicial security \u2014 is \"looking into all the unsolicited pizza deliveries to federal judges and taking appropriate steps to address the matter.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik, who presides in Seattle, said that to his knowledge more than 50 judges nationwide have been pizza-doxxed, not including the judges' families and their associates. He said he and his children all received pizza boxes in Anderl's name after he gave press interviews about attacks on the judiciary.",
      "\"They're looking into it,\" Lasnik said about the U.S. Marshals' investigation. \"But it's very difficult in this day and age to track where these things originate.\"",
      "Lasnik said his colleagues handling cases involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been \"bombarded with hate mail and hate emails and threats.\"",
      "\"It's so discouraging to a young judge to suddenly not only worry about how do I do this job right, but how do I keep my family safe,\" he said.",
      "Salas spoke about the five-year anniversary of her son's death, which occurred in July 2020, and the increase in violent rhetoric in recent months that has led to more judges speaking out about the threats they have received.",
      "\"You know, we're seeing things coming out, from the top down, from White House spokespeople calling, you know, us crazy, leftist, unconstitutional judges,\" Salas said. \"And I think that we, in fairness, are nonpartisan, but we have to speak the facts. And the facts are that we have political leaders with large social platforms, political leaders with power, right? Calling us deranged and idiots, that is the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that I think caused the judges that are on here today to come forward.\"",
      "She urged the nation's political leaders to tone down the rhetoric and stop calling judges \"corrupt\" and \"biased.\"",
      "\"They are inviting people to do us harm, they are inviting that man to call you because now he feels emboldened to use those words against you, because our leaders are calling us idiots and deranged and monsters,\" she said. \"Don't make it personal. Appeal us to a higher court.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, also on the bench in Seattle, said he and his wife were \"swatted,\" an illegal scheme in which people make false emergency calls in an attempt to draw police SWAT teams to the homes of public figures.",
      "Recounting the incident, the judge, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said law enforcement received a call that he had murdered his wife and arrived at their house with their weapons drawn.",
      "Shortly afterward, the FBI informed him that there was a bomb in his house, Coughenour said.",
      "\"What kind of people do these things?\" he said during the forum. \"It's just so disgusting and it's really unspeakable that people will do these things.\"",
      "Coughenour said that through his decades as a federal judge, he repeatedly heard jurists in other countries discuss how admired the U.S. judiciary was.",
      "But he said it's \"stunning to me how much damage has been done to the reputation of our judiciary, because some political actors think they can gain some advantage by attacking the independence of the judiciary and threatening the rule of law.\"",
      "Coughenour issued a call for lawyers and fellow judges to speak out against the attacks on the judiciary and say \"not in this country and not on our watch.\"",
      "The attacks appear to go beyond threats and harassment and also seek to inflict professional punishments on the judges. McConnell said he was the subject of judicial misconduct complaints filed by America First Legal, a conservative organization that was run by Stephen Miller, and two members of Congress. Miller now serves as White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "Both McConnell and Coughenour are overseeing cases that challenge policies implemented by the second Trump administration. Coughenour in February issued a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship and McConnell in March blocked the White House's freeze on federal funding.",
      "The Justice Department appealed both decisions and legal proceedings are ongoing.",
      "Threats to federal judges have steadily risen over the last six years, according to the Marshals. A vulnerability management program run by the federal judiciary that was established after the death of Salas' son provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report released in March.",
      "In 2022, after the leak of a draft Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, a California man armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Maryland home. The man was charged with attempted murder and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Salas told CBS News that it's not just federal judges who are targeted \u2014 state judges are now being pizza-doxxed, including those in Florida and Colorado.",
      "Colorado Chief Justice Monica Marquez has \"gotten so many pizzas she's stopped counting,\" said Salas. Marquez cast a deciding vote in a 4-3 decision by Colorado's Supreme Court in December 2023 to disqualify then-candidate Trump from the Colorado ballot before the 2024 election. The court found that Mr. Trump was ineligible for the presidency under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment, a decision that was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court.",
      "Marquez spoke about the toll of that vote\u00a0in November 2024, which she knew could be the most consequential of her career. She described how she was late for the court's conference that day because \"I was in my chambers bathroom vomiting from the stress. I knew exactly what was on the line.\"",
      "In Florida, two state judges were targeted with pizzas, some also in the name of Salas' son. A 49-year-old man, Jonathan Mark Miller, has been charged with \"fraudulent use of personal information\" for the orders that targeted the judges.",
      "But Salas said this accountability is rare.",
      "\"State bad actors have been caught,\" she said, but the acts of intimidation against federal judges have come from \"unknown sources.\"",
      "\"That troubles me,\" Salas said, \"because we don't know who is doing this. We don't know whether this is a group of bad actors, a few bad actors. But clearly judges are being targeted, and the message is clear.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:43:36 -0400",
    "summary": "The workforce of a federal agency that oversees billions in grants for primary health care, AIDS/HIV, maternal and child health services, and workforce training has been slashed, sparking fears of what's to come.",
    "story": [
      "A little-known federal agency that sends more than $12 billion annually to support community health centers, addiction treatment services, and workforce initiatives for America's neediest people has been hobbled by the Trump administration's staffing purges.",
      "The cuts are \"just a little astonishing,\" said Carole Johnson, who previously led the Health Resources and Services Administration. She left the agency in January with the administration change and has described the sweeping staff cuts as a \"big threat\" to the agency's ability to distribute billions of dollars in grants to hospitals, clinics, nonprofits, and other organizations nationwide.",
      "Since February, about a quarter of workers at HRSA \u2014 including analysts, auditors, scientists, grant managers, and nursing consultants \u2014 have left, according to a KFF Health News analysis.",
      "The agency, headquartered in a nondescript gray-and-glass office building tucked into side streets in Rockville, Maryland, employed about 2,700 staffers in early 2025. Employees worked behind the scenes to manage and monitor thousands of projects nationwide that fund primary health providers, HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, maternal and child care programs, rural hospitals, and workforce training.",
      "On the ground, HRSA's grants have helped create telehealth initiatives for mothers in rural New Mexico, funded workforce training for Indigenous nurses in South Dakota, and supported Healthy Start programs for expectant mothers and babies in places like rural Georgia.",
      "Ryan Alcorn, a co-founder and the chief executive of GrantExec, a company that helps organizations match and apply for funding, said every American benefits from the programs HRSA's funding supports: \"When the safety net fails, hospitals become overwhelmed, unpaid costs rise, and premiums go up for everyone.\"",
      "Several former HRSA leaders, who have been in touch with employees, confirmed the magnitude of the cuts estimated by KFF Health News. Johnson said she believes the actual number of workers lost is larger.",
      "More than 700 workers were fired or chose to leave from February through the end of June. The analysis is based on data from the HHS employee directory, which may not include workers who opted out of being listed, and may not be an exact count of the worker roster, which is in flux.",
      "Johnson, who is now a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, and several other former employees interviewed by KFF Health News said they are concerned that specific programs will be eliminated, but also that reduced staffing could affect ongoing program oversight. The agency's workforce ethos, Johnson said, is one in which \"if there were two people left at HRSA, they would work around the clock to try to get the money out.\"",
      "For at least one program, revealed during a tense moment on Capitol Hill in July, money to help low-income and minority students has already stopped flowing to colleges and universities. The Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students program, established through congressional legislation, helped schools pay for students to train to become dentists, physician assistants, midwives, and nurses \u2014 all of whom are in short supply in rural and some urban areas. Candice Chen, acting associate administrator of HRSA's health workforce bureau, confirmed the agency \"did have competitions that were canceled.\"",
      "When U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) asked whether they were canceled by the Trump administration, Chen paused before speaking again: \"Well, the funding decisions were made across the administration.\"",
      "Asked about the canceled funding, officials from several schools declined to comment. Patrick Gonzales, a spokesperson for the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, said in an emailed statement that the school is \"helping students navigate this transition with clarity and care.\"",
      "U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has called for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s resignation or firing, \"whichever one comes first,\" saying there was \"no defensible answer\" to eliminating thousands of workers across federal agencies.",
      "In April, nearly a dozen Democratic senators sent a letter to Kennedy demanding answers about the mass firings, noting HRSA is the \"primary agency tasked with improving access to health care for vulnerable populations.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to the senators' letter. Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services \"has refused to answer basic questions about why the administration conducted mass firings in this office,\" said Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.).",
      "President Trump's proposed fiscal 2026 budget eliminates HRSA as well as some of its programs, including grants to rural hospitals, workforce training, Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, and emergency medical services for children. HRSA spokesperson Andrea Takash said in an emailed response that HHS is \"undertaking organizational changes that support multiple goals while ensuring continuity of essential services.\"",
      "HRSA continues to process new funding announcements and awards for the health centers, workforce programs, child and maternal health initiatives, and \"many more of our critical programs and services,\" Takash said.",
      "HRSA's largest bureau supports thousands of community health centers that serve over 31 million people nationwide. Before the end of September, the agency's grants are still scheduled to pay out billions more to health clinics and other organizations nationwide.",
      "Cuts to health centers could come under more scrutiny because their funding has \"a lot of bipartisan\" support, said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit. HRSA's funding, which includes Section 330 grants, goes to \"keeping the doors open\" at federally qualified health centers nationwide, Horstman said.",
      "An additional 42% of health center funding comes from Medicaid, a federal and state insurance program that covers people with low incomes and those with disabilities, she said. Congress recently voted to reduce Medicaid funding.",
      "Joe Stevens, spokesperson for the Virginia Community Healthcare Association, said health centers are rethinking \"how they do business\" because of the Medicaid cuts and the increased administrative challenges faced when processing their HRSA grants, which have been more challenging to obtain since February. Virginia's health clinics treat about 400,000 people annually, Stevens said.",
      "\"It's a system that's been in place for 50-plus years, and this is the first time they're having issues receiving their funds,\" he said, noting that clinics now must also provide an itemized list of how the money is to be used after grants have been approved.",
      "\"Our health centers are understaffed, so having somebody to have to enter that information every two weeks is just more time,\" Stevens said.",
      "For months, HRSA staff across all departments have worked through changes to their technology systems and transitioned work to others as employees left their jobs. Workers have continued to process grants despite a February executive order that froze federal funding and a March announcement that HHS would lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies \u2014 including HRSA.",
      "One former employee said that, at this point, \"all we're doing now is keeping the lights on.\"",
      "Michael Warren, who left the agency in June, ran HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Warren described the bureau's staffing cuts as \"substantial.\" The bureau awarded more than $628 million in grants between Oct. 1, 2024, and July 22, 2025, to programs that included providing block grants to states and funding home visiting programs, through which trained staffers work with families with young children.",
      "Warren, who is now the chief medical and health officer for the March of Dimes, said America faces a crisis as one of the \"most dangerous places in the world to give birth among other high-income countries, and that shouldn't be the case.\"",
      "With tears brimming, Warren said his former employees \"wake up every morning, they work all day, and they go to sleep every night thinking about what they can do for mothers, children, and families.\"",
      "Methodology",
      "For this article, KFF Health News calculated workforce reductions at the Health Resources and Services Administration using public information from the Department of Health and Human Services directory posted online. We compared the number and type of employees listed with HRSA in February to those in early July. Our employee totals exclude people listed as interns, fellows, student trainees, or volunteers. The directory is not an official count of HRSA employees, but it offers detailed snapshots of trends so far this year. Reporters also cross-checked the estimates with former employees.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

But somehow, if you've made money, you're supposedly \u2014 I think Senator Hawley suggests \u2014 you shouldn't be serving, because you might trade stocks.\"",
      "\"Anybody want to be poor? I don't.\" Scott continued. \"Right? So this idea that we're going to attack people because they make money is wrong. Is absolutely wrong. We should cherish all of our different backgrounds. ... So, I think it's disgusting what is going on here.\"",
      "Some Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee insisted that blind trusts are sufficiently restrictive. But Hawley said blind trusts are \"often workarounds,\" and members can still influence decisions.",
      "The measure, originally called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from trading or holding individual stocks, giving them 180 days to sell their stocks. Members would also have to supply their House or Senate ethics committee with written certification of compliance each year, and the Government Accountability Office would conduct a compliance audit every two years. Hawley, as a part of negotiations with Democrats, agreed to call it the Honest Act.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced support for the legislation in a statement.",
      "\"While I appreciate the creativity of my Republican colleagues in drafting legislative acronyms, I welcome any serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service,\" Pelosi said.",
      "Hawley also said the legislation would ban the next president and vice president from holding or trading individual stocks while in office, meaning the legislation wouldn't affect President Trump. A reporter asked the president if he supports Hawley's bill.",
      "\"Well, I like it conceptually,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know about it. But I like it conceptually.\"",
      "But later in the afternoon, Mr. Trump went off on Hawley on Truth Social with a very different tone than he took only hours earlier, calling him a \"second-tier Senator.\"",
      "\"The Democrats, because of our tremendous ACHIEVEMENTS and SUCCESS, have been trying to 'Target' me for a long period of time, and they're using Josh Hawley, who I got elected TWICE, as a pawn to help them,\" the president wrote. \"I wonder why Hawley would pass a Bill that Nancy Pelosi is in absolute love with \u2014 He is playing right into the dirty hands of the Democrats. It's a great Bill for her, and her 'husband,' but so bad for our Country!\"",
      "Hawley on Thursday said he had a visit with Mr. Trump Wednesday night, following the president's Truth Social post. According to Hawley, Mr. Trump said that senators told him, falsely, that the bill would force him to sell all of his assets and properties, including his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "\"And so I said, 'Well, that's just false. It explicitly exempts you and all your assets,'\" Hawley told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. \"So we walked through that and he was like oh, that was not what he had been told.\"",
      "Hawley said the president told him he wants to see a ban on stock trading.",
      "\"He reiterated to me that he wants a stock trade ban, he supports a stock trade ban,\" Hawley told reporters.",
      "Hawley introduced similar legislation in 2023, but it didn't make it out of committee.",
      "The proposed measure is more restrictive than the\u00a0STOCK Act, which requires lawmakers and senior government officials including the president and vice president to disclose their stock trades and bans them from trading on information they learn in the course of their public service.",

      "\"In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their governor,\" the 60-year-old Oakland native and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee said. \"I love this state, its people, and its promise.

      "\"For now, my leadership\u2014and public service\u2014will not be in elected office,\" she added.",
      "Declining a gubernatorial bid gives Harris a window to run for president in 2028. Since Harris' defeat in her truncated 2024 presidential run, which followed then-President Joe Biden's decision to drop his reelection bid, the Democratic Party has wondered what Harris' next political move will be. In May, sources familiar with Harris' thinking said she was weighing a campaign to be California's chief executive, a third run for the White House or not seeking elected office.",
      "Harris announced on Thursday that she's written a book about her 2024 campaign that will be released in September. It's called \"107 Days,\" highlighting the breakneck pace of her last-minute bid for the presidency.",
      "\"What the world saw on the campaign trail was only part of the story,\" she wrote. \"My new book is a behind-the-scenes look at my experience leading the shortest presidential campaign in modern history. 107 Days is out on September 23. I can't wait for you to read it.\"",
      "A source close to Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS News that while Harris \"seriously considered\" a run for California governor in 2026, she ultimately decided against it \u2014 concluding she can have more impact for her party on a national stage and that her \"heart wasn't into running for governor\".",
      "\"She grappled with it,\" the source said about a possible gubernatorial bid. \"There were a lot of conversations over the last few months. But she's been a public servant for her whole career.\" The source said she wants to take time to experience life as a private citizen.",
      "According to the source, Harris felt tempted by the idea of leading her home state, but instead, she is finding other ways to remain engaged in public life \u2014 including potentially writing a book, launching her nonprofit and traveling the country to campaign for Democratic candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"She genuinely has not decided about a 2028 presidential run,\" the source said, adding the decision not to seek the governorship \"keeps the door open\" for a potential run in 2028.",

      "I am a devout public servant, and from the earliest days of my career, I have believed that the best way I could make a difference in people's lives and fight for a better future was to improve the system from within.

      "I have extraordinary admiration and respect for those who dedicate their lives to public service\u2014service to their communities and to our nation. At the same time, we must recognize that our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis. As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking\u2014committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook.",
      "For now, my leadership\u2014and public service\u2014will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.",

      "Mr. Trump wrote on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that South Korean goods will face a 15% tariff \u2014\u00a0lower than\u00a0the 25% he threatened earlier this month \u2014 while U.S. imports to South Korea will not face tariffs. He said South Korea will be \"OPEN TO TRADE\" and will accept U.S. automobiles.",
      "South Korea is the latest key U.S. trading partner to reach an agreement with the Trump administration, ahead of a Friday deadline when Mr. Trump says he'll impose hefty tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung confirmed his country had reached a deal with the U.S. in a Facebook post.",
      "In addition to the 15% tariff, Mr. Trump said South Korea agreed to \"give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself.\" Lee said the fund will help South Korean companies enter the U.S. market, especially in industries like semiconductors and biotech, and $150 billion of the total $350 billion will focus on shipbuilding.",
      "South Korea will also buy $100 billion dollars' worth of liquified natural gas or other energy products, and will \"invest a large sum of money for their investment purposes,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "South Korea was the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner last year, not including multi-country blocs like the European Union, according to Census Bureau data. The U.S. imported $131.5 billion worth of South Korean goods, and South Korea bought $65.5 billion in American goods.",
      "More than $45 billion worth of U.S. imports from South Korea were cars and car parts, according to federal statistics. Cars from South Korea will be subject to the 15% tariffs, rather than the blanket 25% rate that Mr. Trump has imposed on foreign cars and car parts from other countries, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said on X.",
      "The president also\u00a0announced a deal with Japan last week\u00a0and a deal with the 27-nation EU on Sunday. Deals are still outstanding with the U.S.'s three largest single trading partners:\u00a0Canada, Mexico and\u00a0China.",
      "Trump strikes trade deals as tariff threats loom",
      "Mr. Trump has spent much of his first six months in office pressing U.S. trading partners to agree to trade deals \u2014 and floating large-scale tariffs if they don't correct what he views as imbalanced trading practices.",
      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate. Then this month, the president sent letters to South Korea and around two dozen other trading partners telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Friday, Aug. 1, unless deals are reached.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood behind that deadline, writing on Wednesday: \"THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE \u2014 IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\"",

      "All told, the president said this week he expects that most imports to the U.S. will face a baseline tariff of 15% to 20%. By comparison, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports in 2023 was around 2.5%, according to figures from the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing. But many economists warn tariffs can lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves rattled financial markets.",
      "Consumer prices have been relatively stable so far this year \u2014 though above the Federal Reserve's 2%-per-year target. Some economists say that's partly because companies have taken steps to prevent short-term shocks from tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "Top Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm over a GOP plan to redraw Texas' congressional maps, warning in interviews with CBS News it would dramatically dilute minority representation in the Lone Star State and set off a nationwide ripple effect.",
      "Republican state lawmakers unveiled a draft congressional map on Wednesday that would turn five U.S. House districts currently held by Democrats into GOP-leaning seats \u2014 an idea blessed by President Trump as Republicans angle to hold onto their narrow congressional majority in next year's midterms.",
      "One Democratic member of Congress whose district could be impacted called the proposed map \"grossly unfair,\" arguing Black and Latino communities are being \"scrambled\" and intentionally fractured for political gain.",
      "\"They've already gerrymandered the map \u2014 and now they're trying to make it 30 to 8 in favor of Republicans,\" the lawmaker told CBS News, referencing the state's congressional delegation. \"This is grossly unfair and starts a dangerous domino effect. If Texas lights the fire, it will spread to other states like California and New York. It's going to be a mess across the country.\"",
      "The Democratic representative also argued that Texas Republicans are banking on maintaining the historic margins they saw among Hispanic voters in November's election, but warned that recent polling shows a softening in GOP support among Latino voters \u2014 particularly in the wake of backlash over the Trump administration's deportation policies.",
      "Those voters \"may not be there,\" the lawmaker said, cautioning the strategy could backfire and jeopardize Republican gains.",
      "Another top Democrat who has previously run statewide in Texas echoed the concern, calling the proposal \"deeply undemocratic.\"",
      "\"We're seeing losses of representation for people of color in Texas,\" the Democrat said. \"Five of the affected districts are Latino-majority seats. They're not just stacking the deck \u2014 they're doing it without any expectation of being held accountable. But they will be held accountable.\"",
      "New congressional map could expand GOP's House edge",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly encouraged Texas Republicans to reshape the state's congressional districts, predicting to reporters earlier this month a \"simple redrawing\" could net five extra seats for his party. The GOP currently controls 25 of Texas' 38 House districts, which were last redrawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "House Republicans are defending a razor-thin seven-seat majority in next year's congressional elections \u2014 a challenging task since the party that controls the White House almost always loses upwards of a dozen seats in the midterms.",
      "Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called the state legislature into a special session, and on Wednesday, lawmakers released an early draft map \u2014 though changes could be made. It will need to pass the GOP-controlled state House and Senate.",
      "The map would improve the GOP's edge by tilting two Democratic seats in the Rio Grande Valley to the right, making a pair of districts in the Dallas and Houston area redder and merging two Democratic seats near Austin into one.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar \u2014 who already represents a district won by Mr. Trump in 2024 \u2014 would lose parts of the San Antonio suburbs under the new map. And the Dallas-area district held by Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson would be redrawn to stretch more than 100 miles from Dallas County to deep-red parts of rural North Texas.",
      "Texas Republicans have pledged to ensure the redistricting plans are constitutional. Abbott has argued the maps need to be redrawn due to \"constitutional concerns\" raised by the Justice Department. CBS News has reached out to the Texas GOP for comment.",
      "But Democrats have blasted the map, which Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin called a \"blatant gerrymander\" and a \"likely violation of the Voting Rights Act.\" Rep. Greg Casar \u2014 whose Austin-area district would be merged with that of fellow Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett \u2014 called the move \"illegal voter suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans.\"",
      "The governors of some Democratic states, including California and New York, have floated launching their own mid-decade redistricting processes, with an eye to creating more blue seats. But those plans could require constitutional amendments since, unlike Texas, those two states have put independent commissions in charge of redistricting.",
      "Johnson \u2014 whose Texas district is set to be redrawn \u2014 says other states should redraw their maps in response.",
      "\"This is an all-out war,\" she told CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe. \"I am for fair and independent redistricting across the country, so long as we all do it. But if we're going to do partisan gerrymandering, then game on, we all should.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some experts have suggested Texas' plan to create five extra GOP-leaning districts could make some of those newfound red seats more competitive, by distributing Republican voters across more districts.",
      "The state has also undergone significant demographic changes in recent elections. The fast-growing Dallas and Houston suburbs have shifted toward Democrats, but the once reliably blue Rio Grande Valley has become redder with more Hispanic voters supporting Republican candidates.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is willing to provide information to a congressional committee next month during a deposition but only if she is granted immunity or is pardoned, according to a letter from her attorney obtained by CBS News.",
      "Last week, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, to sit for a deposition as fallout over the Trump administration's handling of the case continues to intensify. A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence.",
      "However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump.",
      "\"Public reports \u2014 including your own statements \u2014 indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Markus wrote.",
      "Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to \"ensure accuracy and fairness,\" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create \"security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, \"any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool.\"",
      "However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, \"she would be willing\u2014and eager\u2014to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell \"will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter \"soon,\" but said it \"will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.\"",
      "In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25\u00a0 to discuss Epstein.",
      "After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is \"allowed\" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.",
      "Virginia Giuffre's relatives say Maxwell should \"rot in prison\"",
      "Several family members of Virginia Giuffre \u2014 one of the most prominent people to accuse Epstein and Maxwell of abuse \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday that the government should \"never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency,\" calling her a \"monster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.\"",
      "\"Maxwell destroyed many young lives, and she was convicted for only a fraction of the crimes she actually committed. She must remain in prison \u2013 anything less would go down in history as being one of the highest travesties of justice,\" read the statement, which was penned by two of Giuffre's siblings and their spouses.",
      "The relatives also criticized the decision to meet with Maxwell.",
      "\"If our sister could speak today, she would be most angered by the fact that the government is listening to a known perjurer. A woman who repeatedly lied under oath and will continue to do so as long as it benefits her position,\" they wrote.",
      "Giuffre\u00a0died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Maxwell with perjury as part of her 2020 sexual abuse case, accusing her of lying in a deposition for a civil lawsuit. Those charges were separated out of the main case.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week\u00a0that he \"hasn't thought about\" pardoning Maxwell.",
      "\"No leniency is being given or discussed. That's just false. The President himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Trump says Epstein \"stole\" employees from him \u2014 possibly including Virginia Giuffre",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he cut ties with Epstein in the early 2000s because the financier \"stole\" employees from his business \u2014 reiterating his comments from a day earlier.",
      "The president said the workers in question were young women who worked in the spa at Mar-A-Lago. Asked whether Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre was one of the employees, Mr. Trump said, \"I think that was one of the people.\"",
      "Giuffre has alleged in civil court\u00a0that she was a 16-year-old employee at Mar-A-Lago when Maxwell first met her and \"recruited\" her \"into Epstein's sex trafficking activities.\" Giuffre was among the most prominent people to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Mr. Trump noted Tuesday that Giuffre \"had no complaints about us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was friends with Epstein for years before their relationship ended in the 2000s. In the past, the White House has said the president \"kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a creep.\" Asked Tuesday about whether Epstein was cut off for being a \"creep\" or for stealing employees, Mr. Trump said, \"maybe they're the same thing.\"",
      "\"He took people. And because he took people, I said, 'Don't do it anymore, you know, they work for me,'\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday, while flying back to the U.S. on Air Force One after a trip to Scotland. \"Beyond that, he took some others. And once he did that, that was the end of him.\"",

    "summary": "A dozen congressional Democrats are suing the Trump administration for limiting access to ICE detention facilities.",
    "story": [
      "A dozen Democratic members of Congress sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its effort to limit their access to detention centers housing immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, accusing the White House of inhibiting lawmakers' oversight responsibilities.",
      "The lawsuit alleged the Trump administration had blocked attempts by Democratic lawmakers in states throughout the U.S. to enter Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers and sought to delay plans to visit and inspect such facilities.",
      "The lawmakers argued in their complaint that the actions by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, violate a provision of federal law that guarantees members of Congress access to facilities holding those awaiting deportation.",
      "\"These illegal actions have harmed each Plaintiff's right as an individual member of Congress to conduct oversight and obtain information about DHS facilities and the conditions of immigration detention,\" the lawmakers said in their lawsuit, which was filed by lawyers from the groups Democracy Forward and American Oversight.",
      "The complaint asked the federal district court in Washington, D.C., to require DHS to give members of Congress unfettered access to ICE holding facilities \u2014 even during unannounced visits \u2014 for the purposes of conducting congressional oversight.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have sparred with the Trump administration for months over access to ICE facilities. One May\u00a0clash with ICE officials\u00a0at a Newark detention center led the Justice Department to charge Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey with assaulting law enforcement officers. She has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. Six Maryland Democrats said they were\u00a0denied access to an ICE facility in Baltimore\u00a0earlier this week, and Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado\u00a0said he couldn't get into a facility\u00a0in a Denver suburb last week.",
      "The complaint noted that appropriations law dating back to 2019 says DHS cannot use funds allocated by Congress to \"prevent\" members of Congress from entering detention facilities housing immigration detainees for the purposes of oversight. The Fiscal Year 2024 Appropriations Act also included a provision that states DHS should not require members of Congress to \"provide prior notice of the intent\" to inspect such facilities.",
      "But DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said the department is now requiring lawmakers to give a week of prior notice before any oversight visit to an ICE detention facility, citing President Trump's constitutional powers to oversee the executive branch. She said requests to shorten that time must be approved by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "\"As for visits to detention facilities, requests should be made with sufficient time to prevent interference with the President's Article II authority to oversee executive department functions \u2014 a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President's constitutional authority,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "DHS has also taken the position that lawmakers don't automatically have access to visit ICE field offices and other short-term processing facilities, since they are not long-term detention centers. Some ICE field offices, however, have been used as makeshift detention centers recently, with holding facilities in New York and other cities housing detainees for days.",
      "Citing an increase in threats and attacks against ICE officers, McLaughlin said any visits by lawmakers to ICE field officers or processing sites that are not detention centers would need to be approved by Noem.",
      "McLaughlin said the members of Congress who sued the administration Wednesday \"could have just scheduled a tour.\" Instead, she said, \"they're running to court to drive clicks and fundraising emails.\"",
      "The dozen Democrats who joined the lawsuit were Reps. Joe Neguse and Jason Crow of Colorado; Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York; Bennie Thompson of Mississippi; Jamie Raskin of Maryland; Veronica Escobar of Texas; and Robert Garcia, Luis Correa, Jimmy Gomez, Raul Ruiz and Norma Torres of California.",
      "Wednesday's lawsuit comes as the Trump administration escalates its aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. In recent weeks, ICE has transferred a record number of detainees to its sprawling detention system. As of this week, the agency was holding 57,000 individuals facing deportation, according to internal government data.",
      "As the number of those in ICE custody has ballooned since the start of the year, some detainees have reported unsanitary and substandard conditions in facilities across the country. A recently released video showed detainees lying on the floor at an ICE holding facility in New York in what advocates called \"inhumane\" conditions. The Trump administration has categorically denied all claims of subpar conditions at ICE facilities.",

      "Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas and five other defendants, including a suspected high-level member of an Israeli transnational organized crime group, were arrested Wednesday for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that Arenas owned, according to unsealed court documents.",
      "According to an indictment that was filed on July 15, federal prosecutors in the Central District of California allege that between September 2021 and July 2022, Arenas allegedly rented out a mansion in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles so he and his co-conspirators could run illegal high-stakes poker games out of the house.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Arenas ordered one of the co-defendants to stage the mansion to host the poker games and collect rent, while another co-conspirator Yevgeni Gershman, a suspected Israeli organized crime member, hired women, who allegedly in exchange for tips, served drinks, provided massages, and \"offered companionship\" to the poker players.",
      "Arenas, nicknamed \"Agent Zero\" from his playing days as an all-star guard in the NBA, was charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business, one count of operating an illegal gambling business, and one count of making false statements to investigators.",
      "Arenas pleaded not guilty Wednesday in United States District Court in Los Angeles and was released on $50,000 bond, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 23.",
      "Arenas' successes on the court, including being a three-time All-NBA team player and making three NBA All-Star game appearances as a member of the Washington Wizards, were overshadowed by his off-the-court issues, including multiple incidents involving firearms.",
      "In January 2010, Arenas was charged with felony gun possession in Washington, D.C. after allegedly getting into a card-game dispute with a former teammate in December 2009, which resulted in both men drawing guns on each other in the Wizards locker room.",
      "As a result of the incident, D.C. prosecutors charged Arenas with one count of carrying a pistol without a license, which Arenas pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years' probation and 30 days of time in a halfway house and was suspended by the NBA during the investigation. Arenas, now 43, played his last NBA game in 2012.",
      "Since leaving the NBA, he has hosted a range of daily sports shows and podcasts.",
      "Arenas' five co-conspirators were charged with conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and one count of operating an illegal gambling business.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 18:23:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration filed a complaint this week against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows tension over President Trump's deportation policies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration filed a complaint Monday against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows clashes in court between the D.C.-based federal judge and the government over President Trump's deportation policies.",
      "It's rare for the Justice Department to formally accuse judges of misconduct. The move will kick off a long, complex review process \u2014 though some legal experts say the Trump administration could have a difficult time demonstrating that Boasberg violated judicial rules.",
      "Why did the Trump administration file a complaint against Boasberg?",
      "The complaint accuses Boasberg of \"making improper public comments\" about Mr. Trump, and criticizes the judge's rulings in a high-profile case involving Venezuelan migrants who were deported to El Salvador, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Much of the complaint focuses on a March session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a panel of federal judges led by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts that weighs in on how the judicial branch is run.",
      "The Justice Department accused Boasberg of speaking up during one part of the biannual meeting to warn that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts,\" leading to a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "The source of those quotes is unclear, but they were first reported earlier this month by The Federalist, a conservative digital outlet that says it obtained a memo summarizing the meeting. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for further details.",
      "Those comments, the government argues, violated rules requiring judges to avoid publicly comment on cases and to \"act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\"",
      "The complaint also takes issue with Boasberg's handling of Venezuelan migrants who were rapidly flown to a Salvadoran prison under the wartime Alien Enemies Act in mid-March, less than a week after the Judicial Conference meeting.",
      "Boasberg verbally ordered the government to return the migrants to the U.S., even if officials needed to \"turn the planes around,\" but the deportees were still sent to El Salvador. Since then, the judge has accused the administration of defying his orders, and has threatened to hold the government in contempt.",
      "The Justice Department argued Monday that Boasberg \"rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond.\"",
      "\"Judge \u202fBoasberg publicly forecasted his baseless predictions of presidential lawlessness, then issued erroneous rulings based on that preconceived notion,\" says the complaint, which was signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by Boasberg blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, deciding the lawsuit should have been brought in Texas, not Washington, D.C.",
      "Legal experts say Boasberg complaint is misdirected",
      "Several legal experts told CBS News the complaint could face a tough path.",
      "Federal law defines judicial misconduct as \"conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.\" That covers everything from harassment to making partisan statements and treating people in a \"demonstrably egregious and hostile manner.\"",
      "Several law professors say that the parts of Monday's complaint that focus on Boasberg's handling of the deportation case are misdirected.",
      "In general, if a party in a federal case has issues with how a judge has ruled, they're expected to file an appeal \u2014 not a complaint against a judge \u2014 said Jeffrey Bellin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who has served as a judicial ethics investigator.",
      "\"You're not supposed to use the misconduct process to complain about the judge's behavior in the case that you're involved in,\" Bellin told CBS News.",
      "The parts of the complaint that criticize Boasberg for warning the Trump administration may defy court orders are less straightforward, says Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor.",
      "The government accused the Obama-appointed judge of violating a section of the code of conduct for federal judges that says they \"should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.\"",
      "Geyh said that in some circumstances, Boasberg's comments could be \"a potential problem.\"",
      "But he still doesn't believe Boasberg deserves disciplinary action. He said courts have been \"overwhelmed\" by Trump-era executive actions, \"many of which are of dubious constitutionality,\" and need to figure out how to preserve their legitimacy and ensure their rulings are followed.",
      "\"They need to talk about it somehow,\" said Geyh.",
      "Also, while public comments about cases aren't allowed, if Boasberg's remarks were made in a session of the normally private Judicial Conference, \"you could make a pretty good argument, I think, that that is something different,\" Geyh said.",
      "Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said remarks at Judicial Conference meetings typically aren't meant for public consumption.",
      "She also argued Boasberg's alleged comments about the risk of the Trump administration skirting court orders are based on \"very real concerns.\"",
      "\"This is not a novel issue being raised by one particular judge about, 'what if the administration doesn't comply,'\" said Levenson.",
      "What happens next?",
      "It's a complicated process that can take months.",
      "When a complaint is filed, the first step is usually for the region's chief appellate court judge \u2014 in this case, Judge Sri Srinivasin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \u2014 to review the issue and decide how to proceed.",
      "In the vast majority of situations, the misconduct complaint is dismissed at that stage, Geyh said, noting that many complaints are from \"disgruntled litigants who don't like how their case went, and so they kvetch about what went on in their case.\"",
      "The appeals court judge can also privately take corrective action before the issue escalates. For example, they can encourage the judge to admit their mistake, said Geyh.",
      "If the appellate judge decides a complaint has merit, they can refer it to a special committee of judges to conduct an investigation and make recommendations. Then, the region's judicial council \u2014 yet another committee of judges \u2014 decides whether to punish them.",
      "\"The quickest thing is if they dismiss it,\" Bellin said. \"If they don't dismiss it \u2026 we won't hear about it for a while.\"",
      "How can judges be punished for misconduct?",
      "First off, district court judges can't be fired \u2014 unless they're impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote in favor.",
      "\"It's very hard to discipline a sitting federal judge because they have life tenure,\" said Bellin.",
      "Short of that, a judge found to have engaged in misconduct can be publicly censured or reprimanded, or barred from taking on any new cases. The judicial conference can also choose to refer a judge to Congress for impeachment proceedings.",
      "How common are judicial misconduct complaints?",
      "They're not unheard of, though punishments are rare.",
      "Last year, Boston-based U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor was the subject of a misconduct complaint after he criticized Supreme Court Justice Alito in a New York Times op-ed. An appellate judge didn't take further action because Ponsor apologized.",
      "Bellin said it's \"pretty common\" for parties in cases to file complaints about judges, but \"these are not usually done by people who are professional litigators.\" Instead, most attorneys just work their issues with judges into their appeals.",
      "It's especially unusual for the Justice Department to file complaints.",
      "\"You just don't have a history of the Justice Department having an acrimonious relationship with the judiciary,\" said Geyh. \"Historically, it's just a dumb thing to do. You want an amicable relationship with the judges who are going to be deciding your cases. You don't want to be suing them. You don't want to be filing complaints against them.\"",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has been more openly critical of judges than his predecessors.",
      "Besides Boasberg, the Trump administration filed a misconduct complaint in February against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes, accusing her of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" during a hearing. The D.C. appeals court has not addressed the complaint.",
      "The administration also sued every judge in Maryland over a standing order in that court district blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removal.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and his staff have lashed out at judges who have ruled against the government. The president has called for Boasberg to be impeached.",
      "\"It strikes me as a bit of posturing, as an aggressive pushback by the administration against the federal judges,\" Levenson said of the complaint against Boasberg. \"I think it's a real uphill battle for the administration, but the mere filing of the complaint is sort of the shot across the bow.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",

      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ...

      "Liftoff from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, originally set for 12:09 p.m. EDT Thursday, was scrubbed 67 seconds before liftoff due to cloud buildups over the launch complex. The launch was timed for roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the Falcon 9 rocket into alignment with the space station's orbit \u2014 a requirement for rendezvous missions.",
      "\"Hold, hold hold, we are standing down for a violation of weather rules,\" a SpaceX controller said on the countdown net. A few moments later, \u00a0a controller told the crew, \"bad luck on weather there. We just got clipped by a cumulus cloud right over the pad. So we ended up scrubbing for weather\"",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman replied: \"Too bad. But we'll be ready next time.\"",
      "The next launch opportunity is at 11:43 a.m. Friday, weather permitting, setting up a docking at the International Space Station at 3 a.m. Saturday. But forecasters said conditions were expected to worsen slightly, with concern focused on possibly high winds and waves in the Atlantic Ocean along the ascent trajectory where the crew might have to splash down in a launch abort.",
      "Cardman originally expected to fly to the space station last fall, but she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex last June in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" Cardman said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Cardman's co-pilot for the Crew 11 mission is NASA's Michael Fincke, a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, and the expected long delay before it's launched again, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "The fourth crew member is Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, a space rookie. Like his crewmates, he also expected to fly aboard another spacecraft, in his case, a Russian Soyuz.",
      "But he ended up assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it. Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under theagreement.",
      "Fincke said the crew is more than ready for launch.",
      "\"Space has been calling my name ever since I returned from my last mission in 2011,\" he posted on the social media platform X. \"Our crew is ready. Let's do this! Go Falcon, Go Dragon, Go Crew-11!\"",
      "Their ride to the station \u2014 the Crew Dragon Endeavour \u2014 is making its sixth flight, a new record for NASA and SpaceX.",
      "Steven Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said SpaceX is working to certify Crew Dragons for up to 15 flights. The SpaceX ferry ships currently are certified for five flights, but Stich said a detailed analysis of Endeavour's flight history, performance and test results allowed NASA to clear the ship for a sixth flight.",
      "\"Our focus here is to really get to this particular launch, to make sure that we have everything cleared for six flights, and then down the road, we may have a little bit more work to do depending on the specific vehicle and how many flights it is.",
      "\"The overall goal was 15 flights, and we've gotten there on many components. Now we're just down to a handful that really are there (confirmed good) for only six flights.\"",
      "Catching up with the space station",
      "It will take the Crew Dragon 16 hours to catch up with the station early Saturday. After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock around Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-trade-deals-tariffis-deadline/",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:01:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately. Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, too.",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",

      "The airport says Delta Air Lines Flight 56 en route from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam diverted to MSP, landing safely around 7:45 p.m.",
      "The MSP Airport Fire Department and several paramedics responded at the gate, providing initial medical attention to passengers in need. Delta said 25 people were transported to local hospitals for evaluation and care, and most of them were released by Thursday afternoon, including seven crew members.",
      "Based on preliminary flight data, about 45 minutes into the flight the plane experienced fluctuations in altitude consistent with intense turbulence as it was flying over Wyoming, before changing course for MSP.",
      "\"We are grateful for the support of all emergency responders involved,\" a spokesperson for Delta said. \"Safety is our No. 1 value at Delta, and our Delta Care Team is working directly with customers to support their immediate needs.\"",

      "Leslie Woods was heading to Amsterdam to visit some friends when all of a sudden, she felt a drop and the drink cart went flying. She said the intermittent turbulence lasted for about a minute.",

It was that scary,\" said Woods. \"It was like an earthquake. It was just, the plane was shaking so hard and it would stop and it would start again, so it was kind of traumatizing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended how the Supreme Court is handling an unprecedented number of emergency appeals from the Trump administration, saying that as presidents push the limits of their power, courts will have to respond.",
      "Speaking before a group of lawyers and judges Thursday in Kansas City, Missouri, Kavanaugh said presidents in both parties, stymied by inaction in Congress, have relied more on executive orders \"to get things done.\" That's led to more legal challenges, Kavanaugh said, which inevitably draw in the Supreme Court to determine whether the new regulation can take effect, at least temporarily, while the legal challenges play out.",
      "So far, the court has been inclined to say yes, agreeing to allow a number of President Trump's high-profile executive orders to take effect while the lower courts review the merits, such as orders to fire members of independent federal agencies, freeze certain federal grants and plan layoffs at nearly every federal agency.",
      "Asked about criticism that the court isn't doing enough to explain its reasoning in some of those emergency cases, Kavanaugh said the court has written more than it has in the past. He said the court also had made some internal changes in the past five or six years \"to try to get the right answer,\" including scheduling emergency oral arguments, as in the recent case challenging nationwide injunctions.",
      "He said he was a \"fan of more process\" and mentioned two recent cases, including the president's removal power in independent agencies, where he unsuccessfully urged the court to step in and decide the underlying issue before it went through the lower courts.",
      "Kavanaugh's hour-long remarks came in a conversation with U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk, one of his former law clerks, at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit's judicial conference. It's one of several judicial conferences this summer that will feature different justices.",
      "Last week, Justice Elena Kagan spoke to the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where she urged the court to be more cautious with its handling of the so-called emergency docket. She also said that while she finds some of the court's recent decisions \"frustrating\" and \"sometimes even maddening,\" prompting fierce dissents, she believed her colleagues were \"all operating in good faith.\"",
      "Kavanaugh shared a similar sentiment about the other justices, saying even in disagreement, \"they're thoughtfully engaging in difficult issues,\" and he believed it was \"a sign of strength when there are different views expressed.\"",
      "\"The collegiality of the Supreme Court is very strong, strong to this day,\" he said. \"We all look out for each other. We think the other eight are patriots and are good people.\"",
      "His wide-ranging conversation with Pitlyk was at times personal and humorous, touching on everything from lessons he's taken from sports to some of his favorite opinions in recent terms. He said he's aware of criticism of the court, but that \"criticism is part of the job.\"",
      "Like the referees for high school sports, Kavanaugh said, as a justice, \"you have to recognize and know thick skin and criticism comes with the territory.\"",
      "\"Did you ever walk out of a game and say, 'our team lost, but the refs were great?'\" Kavanaugh said, to laughter from the audience. \"That informs my judging, too.\"",
      "Jan Crawford is CBS News' chief legal correspondent and a recognized authority on the Supreme Court. Her 2007 book, \"Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for the Control of the United States Supreme Court\" (Penguin Press), gained critical acclaim and became an instant New York Times Bestseller."

    "story": [
      "Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data.",
      "States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show.",
      "That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration.",
      "The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined.",
      "The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation.",
      "Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data.",
      "Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.",
      "Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.",
      "\"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added.",
      "Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said.",
      "Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.",
      "Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.",

      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",

The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",
      "\"Wild potatoes are very difficult to sample, so this dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of wild potato genomic data ever analyzed,\" said the paper's first author, Zhiyang Zhang of the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen.",
      "Outside of the ancestry, there's also a linguistic similarity, according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"The word 'tomato' started out as 'tomate' and came from the Nahuatl word 'tomatl.' Since the potato had been introduced to the English some decades earlier, the word evolved to mimic the form of 'potato' \u2014 hence the spelling 'tomato,'\" the dictionary notes.",

      "The suspect's gun malfunctioned when he initially tried to shoot at a group of innocent bystanders in the valet area of the property, but once he was able \"to make it operable,\" he fired multiple shots at the victims, Crawforth said.",

She said their house stayed intact but was flooded by 12 feet of water.",
      "Another resident testified that when her family tried to escape the rising water at the vacation house the family has owned for a century, access to the highway and roads was blocked off and fenced.

    "summary": "he NYPD said the gunman purchased the fully-assembled AR 15-style rifle used in the shooting from his supervisor.",
    "story": [
      "Shane Tamura, the gunman who drove from Las Vegas to Manhattan and opened fire in a New York City office building Monday and killed four people, was issued a concealed carry permit in Nevada, despite a documented history of mental health incidents.",
      "Sources said the gunman had at least two mental health incidents in 2022 and 2024. He was also arrested for trespassing in 2023. Law enforcement sources confirmed that he obtained the concealed carry permit in spring 2022.",
      "Tamura, 27, bought the fully assembled AR 15-style rifle for $1,400 from his supervisor at the Las Vegas casino where he worked.\u00a0 The NYPD said the supervisor's purchase of the rifle was legal, but it hasn't yet determined whether Tamura broke any law in buying it from him. The supervisor, Rick Ackley, complied with state and federal gun laws in the sale to Tamura, his attorney, Chris Rasmussen, said.",
      "The NYPD also said they found a handgun in Tamura's\u00a0car, which was purchased legally with the concealed carry permit in June from a gun store in Las Vegas. A tipster told law enforcement that same month that the shooter had purchased a large amount of ammunition and an aftermarket trigger.",
      "Second Amendment expert Ian Bartrum, an emeritus law professor at the University of Las Vegas, noted that while the circumstances of how the suspect bought the gun used in the New York mass shooting are murky, he was legally allowed to carry and transport it within the state under Nevada law.",
      "\"It's the Wild West,\" he said. Tamura's right to transport the weapon across state lines would have been subject to gun bans and other controls on the books in states he drove through, but so in practice, such restrictions would be difficult to enforce.",
      "It is illegal in New York to possess or transport assault-style weapons, but the state law is not designed to stop a shooter who drives into New York from out of state, as Tamura did.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called for a national assault weapon ban, posting on social media \"a gunman from a state with weak gun laws brought an AR-15 to New York.\"",
      "There has not been a national assault weapons ban in the U.S. since the last one expired in 2004. Former President Joe Biden, who was one of the architects of the 1994 ban, urged Congress to pass a new ban but lacked the political support for it. In 2022, Biden signed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun control legislation in three decades, which enhanced background checks for gun buyers under 21 years of age, provided billions for mental health services and closed the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" to prevent convicted domestic abusers from purchasing a firearm for five years.",
      "During his first term, President Trump signed a ban on bump stocks \u2014 which was later overturned by the Supreme Court, another indication of the challenges facing gun legislation. In 2022, the Supreme Court struck down a 108-year-old New York law that limited who can obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in public. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said New York's \"proper-cause requirement\" prevented law-abiding citizens from exercising their Second Amendment right, and held its licensing regime is unconstitutional.",
      "A May 2022 CBS News poll found 54% of Americans want stricter gun laws, while 30% want to keep the laws as they are and 16% want less strict laws. But passing any type of gun control legislation remains difficult, with CBS News polling in 2022 showing deep partisan divides among Americans on the issue. Even if Democrats, who largely support gun control measures, held majorities in Congress, they would likely need to win the support of Republican senators to secure the 60 votes necessary to allow the consideration of any such bill.",
      "Although Nevada has some libertarian characteristics, Bartrum said the state's gun laws are considered more middle of\u00a0 the road for the U.S. \u2014 even though\u00a0 Las Vegas suffered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, when a gunman opened fire on a music festival in 2017, killing 58 people and wounding nearly 500.",
      "Before the Las Vegas shooting, Nevada voters approved a ballot initiative for background checks, which then-state Attorney General Adam Laxalt declared enforceable. But Nevada's state government in 2019 ushered in new gun control measures, including background checks on private sales and transfers and some \"red flag\" legislation, according to the Nevada Independent. Under red-flag laws, courts can issue orders for the seizure of guns from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.",
      "Bartrum said that there has been \"pretty broad bipartisan support for even things like background checks,\" which he described as \"not particularly controversial or onerous.\" But he noted that it has been nearly impossible to enact new gun legislation.",
      "\"Despite that the technology is ever moving forward, the law is sort of stuck in 1865,\" he said. \"So it's a pretty, pretty \u2026 illogical system of regulation.\"",

      "Florida this year has carried out more executions than any other state, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second with four apiece. A 10th execution is scheduled in Florida on Aug. 19 and an 11th on Aug. 28 under death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.",

      "Trial testimony showed he committed the killings at their Okaloosa County home after his wife sought a divorce, and he had told others he would kill his family rather than allow that.",
      "The woman was attacked first with a crowbar and strangled with a rope, court testimony showed. Both children were killed with the machete, and Sylvia was also struck with the blade when Zakrzewski thought she had survived the previous assault, according to court records.",
      "Zakrzewski's lawyers filed numerous appeals over the years, but all were rejected including a final request for a stay of execution denied Wednesday by the Supreme Court.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Zakrzewski awoke at 5:15 a.m. and later had a meal that included fried pork chops, root beer and ice cream, said state Department of Corrections spokesman Paul Walker. He said Zakrzewski had one visitor and \"remained compliant\" as he awaited execution.",
      "Until Thursday's execution, 26 men had died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., while 11 other people were set to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. Florida was also the last state to conduct an execution with Michael Bernard Bell's lethal injection on July 15.",
      "DeSantis signed a warrant for an Aug. 19 execution for Kayle Bates, who was convicted of abducting and killing a woman from an insurance office in 1982. On Wednesday night, DeSantis also issued a death warrant for Curtis Windom, who was convicted of killing three people in the Orlando area in 1992. His execution is set for Aug. 28.",
      "Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "Opponents of Thursday's execution plan pointed to Zakrzewski's military service as an Air Force veteran and the fact that a jury voted 7-5 to recommend his execution, barely a majority of the panel. They noted he could not have received the death penalty with a split jury vote under current state law.",

      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most well-known sex trafficking accusers, expressed shock after President Trump said Giuffre was one of the employees Epstein \"stole\" from the spa at the president's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "Giuffre, who had accused Britain's Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year.",
      "\"It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been 'stolen' from Mar-a-Lago,\" the family's statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump, responding to a reporter's question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers, including Giuffre, from his Palm Beach, Florida, club.",
      "The statement from Giuffre's family is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Mr. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case.",
      "Mr. Trump's comment \"makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions,\" the family's statement said. Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida, is the one \"who targeted and preyed upon\" then 16-year-old Giuffre in 2000, the family said.",
      "\"We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,\" it continued.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter's question and didn't bring up Giuffre himself.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,\" she said.",
      "Asked Thursday afternoon about Giuffre's family's statement, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know\" why Epstein had taken staff.",
      "\"I said if he's taken anybody from Mar-A-Lago, he's hiring or whatever he's doing, I didn't like it. And we threw him out, we said we didn't want him at the place,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I didn't like it that he was doing that.\"",
      "The family's statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche questioned Maxwell over two days in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven't become public.",
      "Maxwell's lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions \"about 100 different people.\" They have said she's willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions.",
      "A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family's statement was sent to Maxwell's attorney Thursday.",
      "A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates.",
      "Giuffre called Maxwell \"the mastermind\" behind the alleged sex trafficking in an interview with CBS News' Gayle King in 2020.",
      "\"She is a monster. She's worse than Epstein. She did things even worse than Epstein did. She was vicious. She was evil. And she's a woman,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Giuffre also told King that Maxwell could incriminate \"very well-known\" people.",
      "Giufree previously said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre's credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a \"substantial donation\" to her survivors' organization.",
      "The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's prolonged downfall.",
      "Her family's statement said she endured death threats and financial ruin over her cooperation with authorities against Epstein and Maxwell.",

      "\"The mother did not return all the way to the car with the kids,\" Maj.

Arkansas State Police Col. Mike Hagar said police have no reason to believe McGann knew the couple or their children.",

      "Police confirmed that McGann's DNA was a positive match to the DNA that was suspected to belong to him at the scene, Hagar said. McGann suffered an injury during the attack that resulted in blood loss, which allowed police to establish a DNA profile, Hager said.",
      "Authorities also executed a search warrant at McGann's house in Springdale, roughly 30 miles north of the state's remote Devil's Den park, where articles were found \"that are consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hager said.",
      "McGann was a teacher in a small Oklahoma school district until May of this year, and then he resigned to take a job in another state. Officials said McGann had no criminal history and no known mental illness history.",
      "The couple was found dead on Saturday at Devil's Den State Park in Washington County, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, the state capital.",
      "The Brink family said the couple died \"heroes protecting their little girls.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge John McConnell said his court in Rhode Island has received more than 400 threatening voice messages.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A trio of federal judges on Thursday publicly detailed threats and harassment they have endured in recent months after handing down decisions against the Trump administration or speaking out against attacks on the federal judiciary, including receiving pizzas that purported to be sent from the late son of a New Jersey federal judge who was the target of an attack.",
      "The appearances marked the first time the judges have spoken out about the threats they've received, and marked the rare occasion of sitting members of the judiciary responding to the attacks leveled against them.",
      "During the course of his second term, President Trump, members of his administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill have lambasted judges who have issued rulings against the president's policies. Some GOP lawmakers have filed articles of impeachment against judges, and the Justice Department has lodged judicial misconduct complaints against two jurists who sit on the federal trial court in Washington, D.C.",
      "The event was hosted by Speak Up for Justice, an organization that seeks to voice support for the judiciary.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell, who is the chief judge of the court in Rhode Island, said he has received six credible death threats. He described one in which a person was searching for McConnell's home address because he wanted \"Smith & Wesson to pay me a visit.\"",
      "McConnell also received a voicemail \u2014 played during the forum \u2014 from a man that said, \"Tell that son of a b***h we're going to come for him,\" and \"how dare you try to put charges on Donald J. Trump.\" The caller continued, telling McConnell \"your ass is going to prison\" and \"I wish somebody would fucking assassinate your ass, someone needs to f**king wipe his ass out.\"",
      "The voicemail was one of more than 400 threatening messages that his court has received, McConnell said.",
      "\"It's daunting. It was frightening,\" he said in remarks during the forum. \"I've never had anyone threaten to put me in prison, threaten bodily injury, wishing that I was assassinated.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama, said it \"shook my faith in the judicial system and the rule of law.\"",
      "But McConnell said the \"most heartbreaking call\" he received was from the U.S. Marshals, who provide protection for federal judges, informing him that a pizza had been delivered to his home in the name of Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas. Anderl was\u00a0killed when he answered the door at his family's New Jersey home\u00a0in 2020 and was shot by a disgruntled gunman who was\u00a0targeting Salas.",
      "CBS News reported in May that about two dozen judges nationwide had received unsolicited pizza deliveries in Anderl's name.",
      "Federal prosecutors have labeled the unsolicited pizza deliveries \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 a spin on \"doxxing,\" in which somebody's address or other personal information is maliciously made public, often as a form of intimidation.",
      "A U.S. Marshals Service official told CBS News in May the agency \u2014 which handles judicial security \u2014 is \"looking into all the unsolicited pizza deliveries to federal judges and taking appropriate steps to address the matter.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik, who presides in Seattle, said that to his knowledge more than 50 judges nationwide have been pizza-doxxed, not including the judges' families and their associates. He said he and his children all received pizza boxes in Anderl's name after he gave press interviews about attacks on the judiciary.",
      "\"They're looking into it,\" Lasnik said about the U.S. Marshals' investigation. \"But it's very difficult in this day and age to track where these things originate.\"",
      "Lasnik said his colleagues handling cases involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been \"bombarded with hate mail and hate emails and threats.\"",
      "\"It's so discouraging to a young judge to suddenly not only worry about how do I do this job right, but how do I keep my family safe,\" he said.",
      "Salas spoke about the five-year anniversary of her son's death, which occurred in July 2020, and the increase in violent rhetoric in recent months that has led to more judges speaking out about the threats they have received.",
      "\"You know, we're seeing things coming out, from the top down, from White House spokespeople calling, you know, us crazy, leftist, unconstitutional judges,\" Salas said. \"And I think that we, in fairness, are nonpartisan, but we have to speak the facts. And the facts are that we have political leaders with large social platforms, political leaders with power, right? Calling us deranged and idiots, that is the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that I think caused the judges that are on here today to come forward.\"",
      "She urged the nation's political leaders to tone down the rhetoric and stop calling judges \"corrupt\" and \"biased.\"",
      "\"They are inviting people to do us harm, they are inviting that man to call you because now he feels emboldened to use those words against you, because our leaders are calling us idiots and deranged and monsters,\" she said. \"Don't make it personal. Appeal us to a higher court.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, also on the bench in Seattle, said he and his wife were \"swatted,\" an illegal scheme in which people make false emergency calls in an attempt to draw police SWAT teams to the homes of public figures.",
      "Recounting the incident, the judge, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said law enforcement received a call that he had murdered his wife and arrived at their house with their weapons drawn.",
      "Shortly afterward, the FBI informed him that there was a bomb in his house, Coughenour said.",
      "\"What kind of people do these things?\" he said during the forum. \"It's just so disgusting and it's really unspeakable that people will do these things.\"",
      "Coughenour said that through his decades as a federal judge, he repeatedly heard jurists in other countries discuss how admired the U.S. judiciary was.",
      "But he said it's \"stunning to me how much damage has been done to the reputation of our judiciary, because some political actors think they can gain some advantage by attacking the independence of the judiciary and threatening the rule of law.\"",
      "Coughenour issued a call for lawyers and fellow judges to speak out against the attacks on the judiciary and say \"not in this country and not on our watch.\"",
      "The attacks appear to go beyond threats and harassment and also seek to inflict professional punishments on the judges. McConnell said he was the subject of judicial misconduct complaints filed by America First Legal, a conservative organization that was run by Stephen Miller, and two members of Congress. Miller now serves as White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "Both McConnell and Coughenour are overseeing cases that challenge policies implemented by the second Trump administration. Coughenour in February issued a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship and McConnell in March blocked the White House's freeze on federal funding.",
      "The Justice Department appealed both decisions and legal proceedings are ongoing.",
      "Threats to federal judges have steadily risen over the last six years, according to the Marshals. A vulnerability management program run by the federal judiciary that was established after the death of Salas' son provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report released in March.",
      "In 2022, after the leak of a draft Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, a California man armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Maryland home. The man was charged with attempted murder and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Salas told CBS News that it's not just federal judges who are targeted \u2014 state judges are now being pizza-doxxed, including those in Florida and Colorado.",
      "Colorado Chief Justice Monica Marquez has \"gotten so many pizzas she's stopped counting,\" said Salas. Marquez cast a deciding vote in a 4-3 decision by Colorado's Supreme Court in December 2023 to disqualify then-candidate Trump from the Colorado ballot before the 2024 election. The court found that Mr. Trump was ineligible for the presidency under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment, a decision that was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court.",
      "Marquez spoke about the toll of that vote\u00a0in November 2024, which she knew could be the most consequential of her career. She described how she was late for the court's conference that day because \"I was in my chambers bathroom vomiting from the stress. I knew exactly what was on the line.\"",
      "In Florida, two state judges were targeted with pizzas, some also in the name of Salas' son. A 49-year-old man, Jonathan Mark Miller, has been charged with \"fraudulent use of personal information\" for the orders that targeted the judges.",
      "But Salas said this accountability is rare.",
      "\"State bad actors have been caught,\" she said, but the acts of intimidation against federal judges have come from \"unknown sources.\"",
      "\"That troubles me,\" Salas said, \"because we don't know who is doing this. We don't know whether this is a group of bad actors, a few bad actors. But clearly judges are being targeted, and the message is clear.\"",

    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting on Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" she added.",

      "In his Thursday social media post, the president said he agreed to a 90-day extension during a phone conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he described as \"very successsful.\"",
      "The president has turned to tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he says are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to strike new trade deals with Mexico and many other nations, the Trump administration has announced trade deals with\u00a0five Asian countries, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.",

      "Many economists project that tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices because the import duties are paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, which then pass on some or all of the costs to shoppers. While inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively muted, there are signs that the import duties are pushing some U.S. prices higher.",

      "The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program.",

      "A fifth person was shot in the back and injured, according to police, who said the individual is 41 and an NFL associate.

Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable.",

      "\"Study my brain please,\" the note read. \"I'm sorry.\"",
      "He also appeared to accuse the NFL of hiding the dangers of CTE.",
      "Tamura was not affiliated with the NFL. Local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appears to show he played high school football.",
      "He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas.",
      "He worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work on Sunday, when he failed to show up.",
      "Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. on Monday afternoon.",
      "That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found.",
      "The gunman purchased the rifle used in the shooting from a supervisor at the casino where he worked, an NYPD spokesperson said. The supervisor has cooperated with investigators and said he purchased the gun legally, the spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear if the sale to Tamura was legal, but the other individual has not been arrested or charged as of Wednesday.",
      "The shooter purchased the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the NYPD said.",
      "NYPD detectives in Las Vegas executed a search warrant at the gunman's studio apartment. They found another note in which the gunman apologizes to his mother, according to an NYPD spokesperson.",
      "They also found a tripod for a rifle, ammunition and prescriptions for antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory and antiepileptic medications, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"A violent, despicable attack\"",
      "Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting.

And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy.\"",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting \"a horrific act of violence\" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States.",
      "\"The killer used an AR-15\u2013style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,\" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms \"only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder.\"",
      "\"The time to act is now,\" Hochul continued. \"The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen.\"",

      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has implemented heavy sanctions on Iranian industries, including trying to stop tankers used to transfer Iranian oil to China, which could help fund Iranian nuclear development programs. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions, which Washington called the most extensive action of its kind since 2018.",
      "Recently, a CBS News crew set off from Singapore, one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, to head more than 80 nautical miles away in international waters to see how the \"dark fleet\" operates.",
      "\"As long as there's a supply, there will be a demand for this discounted oil,\" said Charlie Brown, a former U.S. Navy officer who's now a senior adviser with United Against Nuclear Iran, who is advising the U.S. government.",
      "The supply is Iran, the demand is China, and this mutually beneficial relationship, which has long angered the United States, plays out off the coast of Malaysia in the Riau archipelago, an area the size of New York City.",
      "\"This is 'dark fleet' parking central,\" said Brown, who's been monitoring the \"dark fleet\" for years.",
      "He described one ship, the Tifani, as \"a well-known 'dark fleet' tanker that's always been out here on a regular basis.\"",
      "The tankers, full of oil, sail from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Malacca to the Riau archipelago. There, they transfer the crude to ships bound for China, which buys 90% of Iran's oil.",
      "During the CBS News crew's journey, four ship-to-ship transfers were happening in plain sight.",
      "These \"dark fleet\" tankers \u2014 all with their transponders switched off \u2014   clearly do not want to be identified.",
      "\"Both ships have a net or something, a tarp, deployed over the stern, covering the name and identification number \u2014   it's obvious deceptive practice,\" Brown said.",
      "Further analysis revealed one ship was the elusive Stellar Oracle, laden with Iranian oil. It was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in May.",
      "Close by, another ship-to-ship transfer was underway involving the Alps \u2014   not its real name \u2014   filled with Iranian crude that was also sanctioned in May. The receiving vessel Eon, which is not on any list, was caught in the act \u2014   a new sanctions violator.",
      "According to a congressional report last year, this trade generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up the regime and its nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on this trade this year, but it's having little effect. China doesn't recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran and says that its trade with Iran is legitimate.",
      "By the end of the day, 12 ship-to-ship transfers were recorded in the Riau archipelago \u2014   an unprecedented number and a clear indication Iran and China are only ramping up this illicit activity.",

      "Washington \u2014 U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee are heading to Gaza on Friday to survey food and aid distribution sites and meet with people living there, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Their visit is prompted by a dire humanitarian crisis, as children and adults in Gaza are struggling to survive off insufficient food and the death toll for people trying to get aid in Gaza mounts. President Trump said earlier this week that the U.S. and Israel will partner to run new food centers in the region, but he said Israel would preside over the centers to \"make sure the distribution is proper.\"",
      "Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee have been in Israel meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders about the situation in Gaza. Netanyahu has said, incorrectly, that there is \"no starvation\" in Gaza, despite emerging photos of emaciated children and repeated warnings from food security experts.",
      "\"President Trump is a humanitarian with a big heart,\" Leavitt said during Thursday's White House press briefing. \"And that's why he sent special envoy Witkoff to the region in an effort to save lives and end this crisis. Tomorrow, special envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee will be traveling into Gaza to inspect to the current distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food, and meet with local Gazans to hear firsthand about this dire situation on the ground. The special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "Leavitt said the administration will provide more details once the president approves a plan. She also said the meetings Witkoff and Huckabee have had with Netanyahu and other leaders have been productive.",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this week contradicted Netanyahu's assessment denying grave hunger in Gaza. The U.S. president said the children in Gaza \"look very hungry.\"",
      "\"There is real starvation in Gaza \u2014 you can't fake that,\" he told reporters.",
      "Also at issue is the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has faced\u00a0heavy criticism\u00a0for its food delivery methods and the number of people who have been\u00a0killed\u00a0trying to reach its distribution sites in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have both supported the relatively new GHF to deliver aid in Gaza over the United Nations. A group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, is urging the Trump administration to \"immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "A senior U.S. official told CBS News on Wednesday that the U.S. has committed $30 million for aid in Gaza and those funds would be distributed \"in the next day or so.\"",
      "\"The United States of America supports GHF, but we would support any other mechanism that delivers food and the other needs of the Gazan people in a safe, secure fashion that does not get manipulated or distorted or taken advantage of by Hamas, the official said, adding, \"I'd like to think that some of the NGOs that are not succeeding right now would turn to GHF and say, let's work together for the sake of the Gazans in Gaza.\"",

Witkoff landed in Israel on Thursday, and the White House said he and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will visit Gaza\u00a0on Friday to inspect aid operations.",
      "Witkoff is expected to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told The Associated Press.",
      "This would be the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas showed \"a lack of desire\" to reach a truce.",
      "Over the last 24 hours, at least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. This includes 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said.",
      "That figure is expected to rise further, as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, smaller hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted.",
      "The Israeli military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots, but that it isn't aware of any injuries stemming from Israeli fire. A security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said the gunfire came from within the crowd and altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.",
      "The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducted 251 others. Fifty hostages are still in captivity in Gaza, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas government. Its count doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
      "In Jerusalem, about 50 people, including families of some of the approximately 50 hostages still being held in Gaza, demonstrated on Thursday in front of Netanyahu's office calling for an end to the war.",
      "Israel says it will facilitate the entry of more aid into Gaza",
      "Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza, but aid workers say much more is needed.",
      "The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. That amount is far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed.",
      "The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.\"",
      "The situation has led some leading Israeli rights groups to accuse Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,\" Yuli Novak, the director of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, said Monday.",
      "\"Systematic destruction of the health care system, denial of access to food, blocking of medial evacuations and using humanitarian aid to advance military targets all indicate a clear pattern of conduct, a pattern that reveals intent,\" Guy Shalev from the Israeli group Physicians for Human Rights said.",

      "One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, sending tsunami waves into Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast and Japan. Several people were injured, none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far.",
      "The 8.8 magnitude temblor struck off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, an isolated strip along the Pacific Ocean, overnight. Residents of the peninsula fled inland as 16-foot waves caused flooding.",
      "Immediately after the earthquake, Hawaii issued a tsunami warning and evacuation orders, but by Wednesday morning, the warning was downgraded to an advisory and evacuation orders were lifted on the Big Island and Oahu. Japan's Meteorological Agency also lowered its alerts to advisories.",
      "Hawaii emergency officials gave an all-clear by the afternoon and canceled the the tsunami advisory. The alerts remained in effect along Japan's east coast and southern islands.",
      "States on the U.S. West Coast were placed under a tsunami advisory that remained in effect until Wednesday morning. Many of the warnings in California had been lifted by Wednesday afternoon, with just an area near the California-Oregon border and Ripped Point, in the southern part of the state, under an advisory.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the worst was over.",
      "\"We were fully deployed and ready to respond if necessary but grateful that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been,\" she told reporters in Chile, where she is meeting officials.",
      "Alerts along South America's Pacific coast, including Chile, forced evacuations and closed beaches.",
      "Experts had warned earlier that the effects of the earthquake may continue through Wednesday.",
      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",
      "\"In this case, because of the Earth basically sending out these huge ripples of water across the ocean, they're going to be moving back and forth for quite a while,\" which is why some communities may feel effects longer, he said.",
      "Hawaii sees minor flooding and small waves",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",
      "So far no damage has been recorded, but it will take two to three hours of observation before authorities will be able to determine whether the event has passed, Green said.",
      "Green said data from Midway Atoll, a small island between Japan and Hawaii, measured waves that were about 6 feet from peak to trough. He warned that waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller.",
      "Cars jammed streets and highways in Honolulu, even in areas away from the shore, as people tried to evacuate. Jimmy Markowski, who was visiting Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, said that the roads on the island were packed.",
      "\"We decided to go to elevated ground,\" Markowski told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We passed a few other gas stations, you couldn't even get in 'em.\"",
      "CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV\u00a0reported that the first waves coming ashore were relatively small, though they came at high tide. Flooding was reported in numerous shoreline areas, including parking lots and boat harbors.",
      "The PTSC said the Hilo, Hawaii, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4.9 feet relative to normal sea levels and the Kahului, Maui, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4 feet.",
      "At around 10 p.m. local time, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center director Chip McCreery said wave heights appeared to have peaked.",
      "West Coast feels some effects",
      "The Oregon Department of Emergency Management said on Facebook at around 3 a.m. local time that small tsunami waves were expected along the coast and urged people to stay away from beaches, harbors and marinas and to remain in a safe location away from the coast until the advisory is lifted.",
      "\"This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,\" the department said.",
      "A tsunami warning was posted for a portion of the California coast near the border with Oregon. It was later lowered to an advisory. California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0saying the state's Office of Emergency Services was coordinating with local officials in Northern California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon border.",
      "By Wednesday afternoon, most advisories along the California coast were lifted. The alert for Washington state was also lifted.",

      "Check out this time lapse of the Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay. Notice the abrupt up and down motion of the boats. A tsunami is not just one wave. It's a packet of waves that can last for several hours. This rapid surging of water can create dangerous currents.#tsunami pic.twitter.com/qu5joaFgLG",
      "The National Weather Service said on X that tsunami waves arrived in Monterey around 12:48 a.m. PT. Other cities along the California coast reported small to moderate-sized tsunami waves. A video shared by the National Weather Service Bay Area showed boats bobbing up and down in a harbor as they were rocked by small tsunami waves.",
      "The National Weather Service in Eureka, California,\u00a0said around 4 a.m. local time that Crescent City had seen tsunami waves of about 3.5 feet, with activity building as the region approached a minor high tide. High tide could lead to more flooding. Crescent City has seen dozens of tsunamis since the 1930s, including a 1964 event that killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.",
      "The National Weather Service Bay Area warned that even if the waves are small, they can cause \"seriously dangerous\" currents. The first waves also may not be the highest, the agency said, warning people to avoid coastal areas until told it's safe.",
      "On Alaska's Aleutian Islands, officials recorded waves up to 1.4 feet above tide levels.",
      "Kamchatka sees flooding, volcanic activity",
      "The quake was centered about 74 miles east-southeast of the Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000. Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed and experts predict aftershocks of up to 7.5 for at least a month, according to the Russian News agency TASS.",
      "The temblor appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the 9.1 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "Earlier this month, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 89 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.",
      "The Kremlin said regional authorities on Kamchatka were well prepared for the quake. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the warnings were issued timely and people were quickly evacuated from dangerous areas. He added that the buildings proved resilient to shocks.",
      "A video released by a Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.",
      "Tsunami heights of about 9 to 13 feet were recorded in Kamchatka. Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the port in the city was flooded by tsunami waves, washing fishing boats into the sea. He said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on the Kamchatka peninsula lifted the tsunami warning for the area, some 11 hours after the quake hit. Russian authorities said several people were injured, without giving a figure. The risk of aftershocks and waves remains, officials said.",
      "On Wednesday, lava began to flow from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The 15,584-foot volcano, located in the east of Kamchatka, last erupted in 2023. Observers heard explosions and saw streams of lava on the volcano's western slopes, the Kamchatka branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said.",
      "Scientists have anticipated an eruption, with the volcano's crater filling with lava for several weeks and the mountain spitting out plumes of ash.",
      "\"The Klyuchevskoy is erupting right now,\" the Russian Geophysical Survey said on Telegram, posting photos of an orange blaze on top of the volcano and adding that \"red-hot lava is observed flowing down the western slope. There is a powerful glow above the volcano and explosions.\"",
      "Sometimes described as the \"land of fire and ice,\" Kamchatka is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. It has about 300 volcanoes, of which 29 are active, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "Earthquake sparks international response",
      "The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japanese and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its strength to 8.8 magnitude and a depth of 13 miles.",
      "People went to evacuation centers in affected areas of Japan, with memories fresh of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The tsunami alert disrupted transportation, with ferries, trains and airports in the affected area suspending or delaying some operations.",
      "Waves of about 2 feet were recorded on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and at least one person was injured.",
      "Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nearly 2 million residents are now under evacuation advisories in more than 220 municipalities along the Pacific coast as of midday Wednesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and he urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat. He told evacuees they might not be able to return home by the end of the day on Wednesday.",
      "No abnormalities in operations at Japan's nuclear plants were reported on Wednesday. The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, heavily damaged by the 2011 tsunami, said about 4,000 workers are taking shelter on higher ground at the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure safety.",
      "China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for parts of the country's east coast along Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces. The warning forecasted that waves could reach between one to three feet. The provinces are already under an alert as Typhoon CoMay is expected to land in the Zhejiang province on Wednesday.",
      "Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world's most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas due to\u00a0climate change. People were urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed late Wednesday in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Philippine authorities advised people to stay away from the beach and coastal areas.",
      "\"It may not be the largest of waves, but these can continue for hours and expose people swimming in the waters to danger,\" Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told The Associated Press.",
      "Elsewhere, a tsunami of under a foot was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Mexico's navy warned that tsunami waves will start reaching the northern coast in Ensenada, near California, at around 2:22 a.m. Wednesday local time, and waves could progress along the Pacific coast to Chiapas state, around 7:15 a.m. local time.",
      "In Chile, tsunami warnings were upgraded to their highest level on Wednesday morning. The alert covers most of the nation's 4,000-mile Pacific coastline. The country's Education Ministry also canceled classes along much of the coast.",
      "Colombian officials ordered the complete closure and evacuation of beaches and low-tide areas while maritime traffic was being restricted.",
      "Education officials in Ecuador canceled classes at schools in the Galapagos Islands as well as communities along the coast.",
      "New Zealand authorities warned of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along all coastlines of the South Pacific island nation. The emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.",
      "How are tsunami probabilities categorized?",
      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service.",
      "A tsunami warning is the most severe. It means residents should take action due to a coming tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory means there's the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS.",
      "A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises people to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

      "The United States has repatriated an American child separated from their family from a sprawling camp in northeastern Syria that houses tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the State Department said Tuesday.",
      "The department estimates that some 30,000 people from 70 countries remain in al-Hol Camp and one other similar camp, most of them wives and children of ISIS fighters as well as supporters of the extremist group. They include Iraqis as well as nationals of Western countries who traveled to join the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.",
      "Human rights groups for years have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the al-Hol camp, which the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have administered for years. The SDF are Washington's key ally in combating ISIS in Syria and its sleeper cells, and for years have run large swaths of northeastern Syria.",
      "CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited the al-Hol camp in 2019 and spoke with the camp's residents. Many of them expressed remorse for their prior ties to ISIS and said they wanted to return to their home countries \u2014 often in Western Europe \u2014 but some others defended the group's terror attacks.",
      "The State Department did not give any details about the repatriation, except to say in a statement that the child \"has known nothing of life outside of the camps\" and will be reunified with their family.",
      "The U.S. military for years has been pushing for countries to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp. Iraq has taken back an increasing number in recent years, but many other countries have remained reluctant.",
      "\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in these displaced persons camps in northeast Syria is for countries of origin to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for their nationals,\" the State Department statement read. \"The same goes for former ISIS fighters held in detention centers in northeast Syria,\" it said, using a different abbreviation for IS.",
      "Despite difficult talks to formally merge with the country's new rulers under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, Damascus and the SDF in May reached an agreement to repatriate Syrians in the camp. Since the ouster of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Washington has been pushing for the two sides to implement their deal and unify Syrian territory, which would ultimately put the camp under the control of the government.",
      "Last year, shortly after Assad's government fell, CBS News was taken inside the al-Hol camp. Guards said the security situation had deteriorated since word had spread about Assad's ouster, raising optimism that they could leave the camp.",

      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",

      "The deep-sea trenches, also called Hadal trenches, are \"some of the Earth's least explored and understood environments,\" the researchers wrote. In these extreme environments, the crushing pressure, scant food and lack of sunlight can make it hard to survive. Scientists know that tiny microbes prosper there, but less is known about evidence of larger marine life.",
      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a manned submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet.",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
      "\"Look how many there are, look how deep they are,\" said Huber, who was not involved with the research. \"They don't all look the same and they're in a place that we haven't had good access to before.\"",
      "In the absence of light to make their own food, many trench-dwellers big and small survive on key elements like carbon that trickle down from higher in the ocean.",

The tubeworms and mollusks may survive by eating those tiny creatures or living with them and snacking on the products of their labor, scientists said.",

      "The 31-year-old, who also won seven world championships in biathlon, was climbing Laila Peak in the Karakoram mountain range on Monday when she was struck by falling rocks at about 18,700 feet. Her rope partner, Marina Eva, quickly issued a distress call, launching a massive rescue mission, her management team said. Eva, uninjured, was able to descend to base camp with help from rescuers on Tuesday.",
      "The rescue operation was hampered by low visibility and bad weather.",
      "Rescuers were able to confirm Dahlmeier's death on Wednesday but not retrieve the body because of unfavorable weather, said Faizullah Faraq, a spokesman for the regional Gilgit-Baltistan government.",
      "\"Based on findings from the helicopter flyover and the rope partner's account of the severity of the injuries, it must be assumed that Laura Dahlmeier died instantly,\" her management team said in a statement to German media.

Our shared moments and memories give us the strength and courage to continue on our path.\"",
      "Any final decision on retrieving the body would follow the wishes of Dahlmeier's family, Faraq said. A statement on Dalhmeier's Instagram page said it had been her wish that nobody risk their life to recover her body after an accident. It said Dahlmeier's family thanked the rescue team and climbers, who did their best to make her rescue possible.",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier offered his condolences to Dahlmeier's parents, writing that she \"was an exceptional sportswoman.\" He recalled that he presented her with the highest honor on German sport, the Silver Laurel Leaf, shortly after she won her first Olympic gold medal in 2018.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:40:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The leading international authority on food crises predicted \"widespread death\" in Gaza without immediate action.",
    "story": [
      "The \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,\" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday, predicting \"widespread death\" without immediate action.",
      "The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war.",
      "The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have \"dramatically worsened\" the situation, including \"increasingly stringent blockades\" by Israel.",
      "\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,\" the IPC said. \"Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\"",
      "A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.",
      "\"Deadly turning point\" reached",
      "But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,\" Alex de Waal, author of \"Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press.",
      "An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:",
      "At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.",
      "The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached \"an alarming and deadly turning point.\" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza \u2014 at its lowest level since the war began \u2014 and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished.",
      "Mounting evidence shows \"widespread starvation,\" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed. One in three people in Gaza is going without food for days at a time, according to the World Food Program. Hospitals report a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths in children under 5. Gaza's population of over 2 million has been squeezed into increasingly tiny areas of the devastated territory.",
      "The IPC's latest analysis in May warned that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn't lift its blockade and stop its military campaign. Its new alert calls for immediate and large-scale action and warns: \"Failure to act now will result in widespread death in much of the strip.\"",
      "Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.",
      "Israel eased those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that has been wracked by chaos and violence. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds swarm entering convoys.",
      "While Israel says there's no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza, U.N. agencies and aid groups say even the latest humanitarian measures are not enough to counter the worsening starvation. In a statement Monday, Doctors Without Borders called the new airdrops ineffective and dangerous, saying they deliver less aid than trucks.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said no one is starving in Gaza and that Israel has supplied enough aid throughout the war, \"otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\" Israel's military on Monday criticized what it calls \"false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza.\"",
      "Israel's closest ally now appears to disagree. \"Those children look very hungry,\" President Trump said Monday of the images from Gaza in recent days.",

      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas. And most importantly: to reduce future exposure, new building development should not be allowed in high-risk areas.\"",

There, riders can manage features like audio recording, PIN verification, location sharing, and their list of blocked or favorite drivers. This is part of Lyft's ongoing effort to become the safest rideshare platform in North America.",
      "Lyft Safety Hub on the Lyft app. (Lyft)",
      "What this means for you",
      "These updates from Lyft reflect a broader shift occurring across the rideshare industry: a shift toward more personalized, rider-centric experiences. Companies like Lyft and Uber are recognizing that convenience alone isn't enough; riders also want consistency, control and safety built into every trip. By allowing you to favorite trusted drivers and block those you'd prefer to avoid, Lyft is giving you more say in who you share a car with. These tools create a more predictable, comfortable experience, especially for regular commuters or those who rely on ridesharing for daily routines.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The introduction of features like the Safety Hub shows how rideshare apps are becoming more responsive to what riders value most: clear choices, transparent settings and the ability to shape their own ride environment. This evolution marks a significant departure from the one-size-fits-all model that once defined the rideshare experience.",
      "As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies are focusing on trust, personalization and fostering long-term relationships between riders and drivers. For you, this means future rides won't just be about getting from point A to point B. They'll be tailored to your preferences, comfort and peace of mind.",
      "The image shows a message from Lyft emphasizing the advantages of being a \"favorite driver.\" (Lyft)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ridesharing works best when both the driver and passenger feel respected, valued, and safe. Lyft's latest updates put the power in your hands to shape that experience. With favorite drivers, rider-controlled blocking, and a unified safety hub, you now have more say over how you move through the world.",

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "Why this matters for clean energy and supply chains",
      "Battery waste is piling up, and mining for fresh materials isn't sustainable. Wang's team has proven that high-performance batteries can be made from recycled components at scale.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

      "Meta's wristband could change how you interact with your devices, whether you have a disability or just want a faster way to get things done. Instead of tapping or typing, your wrist muscles can now act as the controller. This means less strain, more freedom, and a whole new way to stay connected on the go. If you've ever wished for a simpler way to text, scroll, or select items without touching a screen, this tech makes it possible. And because it works without a custom setup, you can start using it almost instantly.",

    "summary": "Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn&apos;t replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "This new agent feature is available to Pro, Plus, and Team users through ChatGPT's tools dropdown by selecting 'agent mode' at any point in a conversation. It signals a shift from chat-based assistants to fully capable AI helpers.",
      "ChatGPT agent powers itself with a unified agentic system that combines multiple strengths behind the scenes. It integrates\u00a0Operator's\u00a0ability to interact visually with websites, clicking, filling forms, and navigating pages, with deep research's capacity for synthesizing complex information. Added to this are new tools, including a text-based browser for efficient reasoning, a terminal to run code, and direct API access. The agent also uses\u00a0connectors to apps like Gmail and GitHub to pull relevant data while maintaining security.",
      "When you assign it a task, ChatGPT agent spins up a secure virtual workspace, effectively giving your assistant its own computer. From there, it intelligently decides which tools to use, such as browsing, document editing, or command line interaction, and remembers the task context. This makes workflows smoother and more consistent, letting the agent complete multi-step assignments autonomously yet under your supervision.",

It feels more like a true assistant than a chatbot, capable of following multi-step instructions and updating you as it works.",
      "Agent won't spy on you or go rogue",
      "OpenAI stresses that you remain fully in control. ChatGPT agent explicitly asks for your permission before sending emails, making bookings, or changing files. It actively refuses high-risk requests like bank transfers or actions with serious consequences without your consent.",
      "The agent stops when you open sensitive websites, avoids following harmful web instructions, and lets you clear browsing histories and revoke permissions at any time. Sensitive data like passwords are never stored or exposed because the model does not need to see them.",

      "Now, imagine delegating your most tedious tasks, such as replying to emails, booking dinners, or researching vacations, to an assistant who truly acts on your behalf. ChatGPT agent equips ChatGPT with both intelligence and action; it goes beyond suggesting ideas by actually getting things done.",
      "You retain full control while avoiding the need to micromanage every click or keystroke. Whether your schedule fills quickly or you simply dislike digital grunt work, ChatGPT agent is built to manage these demands efficiently.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",

      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",

These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example.

This high-tech approach could result in better deals or higher costs, not because of who you are, but because of market demand at the time you book.

      "Passengers traveling through an airport\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants smarter, not personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues.",
      "However, the airline states it is not personalizing prices based on individual behavior. Instead, the AI analyzes large-scale patterns, like route demand, seasonal shifts, and timing trends, before analysts set final prices.",

      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%.

      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers.

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives.

      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand.

      "X A woman listening to music on her headphones (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI tools are making full songs in minutes",
      "Platforms like Suno and Udio now allow users to generate original songs with just a few prompts. These tools handle everything, vocals, instruments, structure, with startling sophistication.",
      "The Velvet Sundown reportedly earned more than $34,000 in a single month from streaming platforms. And it's not alone. Other acts, such as Aventhis, a \"dark country\" musician with over 600,000 monthly listeners, are also believed to be powered by AI-generated content.",
      "This isn't happening in a studio with a team of producers. It's often just one person inputting text and outputting tracks. The barrier to entry is nearly gone. With a laptop and internet connection, anyone can create and distribute AI-generated songs on a massive scale.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The music industry responds with worry and legal action",
      "Major record labels are pushing back. Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Records have filed lawsuits against AI music platforms, accusing them of using copyrighted material without permission during the training process.",
      "At the same time, music creators and advocacy groups are demanding regulation. They want AI-generated tracks to be clearly labeled. They're also calling for updated copyright protections to prevent the misuse of human-created work during AI training.",
      "Streaming platforms are starting to acknowledge the issue. Deezer revealed that nearly one in five new uploads are entirely AI-generated. This trend is growing and reshaping the very idea of what it means to be a musician today.",

      "Artists feel like they're competing with ghosts",
      "For emerging musicians, the rise of AI is deeply frustrating. Tilly Louise, an alternative pop artist based in the UK, has amassed millions of streams but still works a full-time job because her music doesn't generate enough income. Watching an AI-generated band pull in massive streaming numbers feels like being pushed aside by something that isn't even real.",
      "She's not alone in this sentiment. Many artists feel overwhelmed by an industry that increasingly rewards volume and virality over authenticity and hard work.",

      "Some embrace the tech while others brace for impact",
      "Not everyone sees AI as the enemy. Grammy-winning producer Timbaland recently launched a venture called Stage Zero, which plans to spotlight AI-generated pop stars. Music schools are also adapting. Educators are now teaching students how to utilize AI tools to enhance their creative process, rather than avoiding them.",
      "Still, even those who are optimistic about the technology admit that it could completely upend the music business. As AI-generated content becomes increasingly easy to produce, the competition for listener attention and streaming dollars will intensify.",
      "Nobody knows exactly what the future will look like, but the direction is clear: AI is no longer on the fringes. It's already in the mainstream.",

      "AI is no longer just supporting music creation; it is actively creating music that listeners are streaming and enjoying. Whether it's rock, country, or pop, AI-generated songs are showing up in more playlists every day. The real question is not whether AI music is good enough. It's whether listeners will care that it wasn't made by a human. As technology improves and the lines between human and machine blur, that question will only get harder to answer.",

      "2. Only approve 2FA requests you initiate: Even if a scammer gets your password, 2FA can stop them from getting into your account. Just ensure that you only approve login requests that you\u2019ve personally initiated. If you get a random prompt on your phone or authentication app, do not approve it.",
      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "For the best antivirus protection in 2025, visit\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "5. Never share sensitive info: Microsoft will never ask for your password, 2FA code, or payment details via email. If you\u2019re unsure, log in directly from a browser to check.",
      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "Among the methods used the night of the crash were the frequent use of allowing helicopter crews to use their own judgment and skills to avoid other air traffic and the use of runway 33, which is shorter and requires jets arriving from the south to leave the usual flight path and travel further east, the outlet noted.",

A manager for the airline testified that it had attempted to make changes after visiting the tower.",
      "In the minutes before the crash, the controller was looking for pilots willing to land on runway 33 to relieve pressure on the main runway. One crew declined and the pilots of the American Airlines flight from Wichita initially hesitated before agreeing, according to a transcript released this week, The Washington Post noted. This sent them on a circling route that would bring them directly into the path of the Black Hawk, which was using a route that passed right under the plane's landing path.",

Runway 33, which is only 5,200 feet long, crosses it at an angle. Runway 33 is available to controllers as a form of relief valve.",

The Federal Aviation Administration also allegedly did not make route changes or warn pilots, despite 85 near misses in the past three years at the airport.",
      "\"It\u2019s so bureaucratic,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said during the hearing, adding, in part, that \"people are so critical of the federal government because you can\u2019t ensure safety.\"",

      "The NTSB on Wednesday kicked off the first day of hearings in Washington, in which investigators pointed to several factors that contributed to the crash. (AP)",
      "Army and FAA representatives attempted to point blame toward air traffic controllers and the lack of separation between planes landing at the airport and helicopters flying on approved routes, but later implied that the routes weren't supposed to ensure separation.",
      "The Army did acknowledge that Black Hawk altimeters may be more than 100 feet off before adding that their pilots aim to maintain altitude within 100 feet of a limit.",
      "Lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing several victims\u2019 families, said the hearing had a lot of \"finger-pointing\" and \"no acceptance of responsibility and accountability.\"",
      "Though the final report will not be released until next year, the hearing on Wednesday revealed how small the margin of error was for helicopters flying the route that the Black Hawk took that night.",
      "The flight data recorder showed the helicopter was 80 to 100 feet higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying, investigators said on Wednesday. The NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "The bigger concern, Army officials said, is that there are some FAA-approved routes around the airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet when planes are landing on a certain runway.",
      "\"The fact that we have less than 500 feet separation is a concern for me,\" Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters, said during the hearing.",
      "Rosengren said that \"if he was king for a day\" he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in the crash and replace them with newer versions.",
      "The incident in January was the first in a string of crashes and near-misses this year that have sparked concern among officials and travelers. (AP)",
      "During the two minutes before the crash, an air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, which included communications with several different aircraft on two different frequencies, according to the NTSB's History of Flight Performance Study released on Wednesday.",
      "The air traffic controller had communicated with the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound airplane that was not the one involved in the crash.",
      "\"All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\" the report said. \"This resulted in a number of stepped-on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\"",
      "Stepped on transmissions refers to those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report includes a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during the two minutes before the crash.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio featured the helicopter pilot telling the air traffic controller twice that they had noticed the plane and would avoid it.",
      "Officials on Wednesday also raised concerns about the use of night vision goggles on the helicopter as a factor in the crash, as the goggles limit the field of view.",
      "Investigations have previously shown that the FAA failed to recognize a history of 85 near-misses around the airport in the three years before the collision and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around Washington with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Even if they had been turned on, the ADS-B Out systems on most of the helicopters in the same unit as the one that crashed would not work because they had been installed incorrectly, officials said on Wednesday. When the NTSB learned of that problem, the Army sent out an alert about it and worked to quickly reprogram the units to ensure they would work.",
      "Homendy said \"every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that,\" but after the incident, the FAA transferred managers out of the tower instead of admitting they had been warned.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced legislation on Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment, but airlines would need to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",

      "There\u2019s an ongoing swathe of killings of Christians across Nigeria and the DRC - reportedly more than 4,000 in Nigeria in approximately the last year. But this barbaric killing in the DRC has led a White House spokesperson to tell Fox News Digital, \"The Trump administration condemns in the strongest terms this horrific violence against Christians in the DRC and is committed to advancing the Washington Accords to bring peace back to the region and end targeted killings. \"",

      "\"Attackers came in\" she said, \"and they beheaded Christians in the church.\" The jihadis \"killed those they met in the church hall. Those who tried to flee, they caught them and killed them in the compound. And then some others who managed to run towards the road, those also were caught and killed. All of them were killed with machetes. Most of those Christians who were killed, were Catholics.\"",

In Sub-Saharan Africa, we think that more than 16 million Christians have been displaced as a result of the violence. The church is on the run.

      "\"French Presidents from Charles de Gaulle onwards have\u00a0reveled in the idea that they are a natural counterweight to U.S. foreign policy on the international stage,\" Alan Mendoza, executive director of the U.K.-based Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital Monday.",

      "Such contrarian actions, Mendoza said, \"have in many ways defined the French Fifth Republic, with\u00a0larger-than-life characters thrusting their views onto the world stage.",
      "\"The difference now is that France matters far less globally than it did 60 years ago,\" he said, adding that a weakening of the European country\u2019s economy and its military might \"means that where once de Gaulle could roar, now Macron whimpers.\"",
      "\"What was once a sign of French strength and confidence now therefore looks more like a desperate attempt to escape irrelevance,\" said Mendoza.",
      "In a dramatic announcement last week, Macron said that at the United Nations General Assembly in September France intends to declare its recognition of a Palestinian state, even as Palestinian terror groups continue to battle Israel in the Gaza Strip.",

      "\"Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken,\" Macron declared in a\u00a0diplomatic stab at Trump\u2019s foreign policy and seemingly an attempt to rally support from\u00a0other European countries to stand up to the U.S.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s ambitions for Greenland, Macron, according to Reuters, said, \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what allies do. \u2026 \u00a0It\u2019s important that Denmark and the Europeans commit themselves to this territory, which has very high strategic stakes and whose territorial integrity must be respected.\"",

      "\u201cKristi Noem needs to get on her big girl pants and do what\u2019s right. She needs to make sure that there\u2019s an apology,\u201d said Judd, who also made it clear that he wants to \u201csupport President Trump\u2019s mission.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to local law enforcement leaders in four states whose agencies participate in ICE\u2019s 287(g) program, under which local officers are deputized to help in immigration enforcement, and whose deputies ICE targeted for recruitment.",
      "The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.",
      "The email, which NBC News has obtained, reads, in part: \u201cAs someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law. Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission \u2014qualities we need now more than ever.\u201d",
      "The email also touts potential $50,000 signing bonuses as an incentive for joining ICE, and it links to a government recruitment website featuring an image of Uncle Sam, the headline \u201cAMERICA NEEDS YOU\u201d and the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment beyond the signing bonuses.",
      "\u201cICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership,\u201d the Pinellas County, Florida, Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement.",
      "The sheriff in Pinellas County is a Republican, as is Judd.",
      "\u201cIt was bad judgment that will cause an erosion of a relationship that has been improving of late. And it\u2019s going to take some getting over, and it\u2019s going to take leadership at DHS to really take stock, \u2019cause, hey, they need state and locals,\u201d Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, said in an interview.",
      "Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails. He also said that the group has not heard from DHS since the emails were flagged to the association and that he intends to send a \u201cvery stern note\u201d to ICE.",
      "\u201cThis is inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same boat. And you just don\u2019t treat friends or partners like this.\u201d",
      "One Florida police chief who did not want to be named out of concern that his department could face retaliation said departments that have partnered with the federal government now fear they could lose their best officers.",
      "\u201cNow you know why everybody\u2019s so pissed,\u201d the chief said.",
      "\u201cThis is like the transfer portal in college sports,\u201d the chief said, adding: \u201cWe see people leave us because they believe they can make more money at other locations. ... Law enforcement has always been a calling. Now it\u2019s a job.\u201d",
      "The DHS media office did not respond to questions about local law enforcement concerns but provided NBC News with a statement that it attributed to a senior DHS official: \u201cICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country. ... This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience. Additionally, more than $500 million from President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill will go to increasing our 287(g) partnerships with state and local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, told NBC News that the Atlanta ICE office \u201csent an apology\u201d for the recruitment email.",
      "Not all sheriffs are upset with the recruitment effort. In fact, some say they support it.",
      "Thaddeus Cleveland, the sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, said, \u201cI think if someone wants to better their life, better their career, you know, look towards the long years, the long game, retirement, there\u2019s nothing better than the U.S. government to go out and have a successful career.\u201d",
      "Cleveland, who has just four deputies, admits he cannot compete with the $50,000 bonuses the agency is offering.",
      "\u201cWe may not be able to turn around and hire somebody the next day. It may take a few weeks. It may take a few months. But again, I support, you know, someone wanting to pursue something they\u2019re interested in. I may end up having to work a little more, which is OK.\u201d",
      "Goliad County, Texas, Sheriff Roy Boyd also said he is not upset about the recruitment and noted that his office also has to deal with the state\u2019s recruiting new troopers from his department.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t compete with the salaries of the state and the feds,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump discussed his plans to renovate the White House, including a new ballroom, gold in the Oval Office and an updated Lincoln Bedroom bathroom.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 One of Donald Trump\u2019s most visible and potentially enduring legacies as president could be the 90,000-square-foot ballroom that he is planning to build, replacing the East Wing edifice traditionally used for the first lady\u2019s offices.",
      "The project, set to begin in September, looms as the biggest transformation of the White House complex since Harry Truman\u2019s day. Perhaps fitting for the onetime New York real estate developer who branded buildings worldwide with his name, Trump has taken to remaking the White House in accord with his tastes since beginning his second term.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that the new ballroom will forgo the need to shuttle guests to tents pitched on the South Lawn for events that are too large for the White House to accommodate.",
      "\u201cWhen it rains or snows, it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d the president said over the phone, lamenting that tents are positioned \u201ca football field away from the White House.\u201d",
      "Trump said that some of the world\u2019s \u201cfinest architects\u201d are involved, and a White House official added that Trump has viewed renderings of the ballroom. The work is expected to finish before the end of his term.",
      "Trump estimated that taking down the East Wing and putting the ballroom in place would cost about $200 million. The East Wing was completed in 1942 under Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Trump said the project would be \u201chis gift to the country,\u201d funded by himself and private donations.",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has set about making an imprint on his White House surroundings. He told NBC News he is replacing what he described as a \u201cterribly\u201d remodeled bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom with one that is truer to the style of the 16th president\u2019s era.",
      "Elsewhere on the grounds, he has put in a pair of towering flag poles and paved over a grassy patch of the Rose Garden. Wet grass poses problems for women in high heels walking through the garden, he has said.",
      "\u201cI was always a great real estate developer, and I know how to do that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Partial to one precious metal in particular, Trump has added gold accents throughout the Oval Office."

      "Bottom dwellers have never been more spectacular.",
      "In a tiny, high-tech submersible sunk deeper than the height of Mount Everest, scientists have discovered a flourishing ecosystem some 30,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The Chinese-led research team found spiky, bright marine worms darting through fields of crimson tubes, itself another kind of worm, poking out of the Earth\u2019s crust like flowers.",
      "There were dense beds of clams, each up to 9 inches long, and snow-like microbial mats creating an ethereal undersea dusting, dozens of feet wide.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time chemosynthesis-based communities have been directly observed at extreme depths,\u201d Dominic Papineau, senior research scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told NBC News.",
      "Papineau, who was among the authors of the research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, added that \u201cmany hadal animals from these trenches are spectacular in their forms and colors\u201d and that they survive by hosting microbes that metabolize methane, rather than through photosynthesis.",
      "At 19,000 to 30,000 feet, hadal trenches are the ocean\u2019s deepest zones that occur at the edge of one tectonic plate as it slides under another. \u201cLong-standing theories suggest that chemosynthesis-based communities are widespread in hadal trenches, but few such communities have been discovered,\u201d Papineau said.",
      "Kareen Schnabel, a marine ecologist at Earth Sciences New Zealand, who was not involved in the study, said the team had discovered something \u201creally rather unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were signs of really abundant, large life-forms and animals in these particularly deep areas,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBecause it is such high pressure in these incredible depths, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect them to live in these places,\u201d she said of the creatures.",
      "The researchers wrote, \u201cThe depths probed here, coupled with the thriving communities discovered and distribution ranges observed, significantly expand the known habitat, depth and biogeographical distributions for a great many species.\u201d",
      "The sun\u2019s rays don\u2019t reach these depths, so the creatures rely on chemosynthesis \u2014 the process of converting chemicals into food \u2014 rather than photosynthesis.",
      "\u201cThese communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches,\u201d the researchers said.",
      "They also face constant crushing pressure of up to 98 megapascals (MPa), a unit of pressure, which is more than six times the force of an alligator\u2019s bite.",
      "The dives for this latest research were conducted in July and August last year by an international team of scientists, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering.",
      "They investigated the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, which is around 1,300 miles long and runs from Hokkaido in Japan to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and the Aleutian Trench, which extends about 1,800 miles from the Alaska and Kenai peninsulas to Kamchatka.",
      "Schnabel previously conducted deep-sea surveys in the same three-person submersible, called Fendouzhe, that was used for this research.",
      "She described the experience of venturing that far down in a submersible \u2014 a type of seacraft that became infamous after one imploded on a 2023 expedition to the Titanic.",
      "\u201cThere is some nervousness, of course, as you\u2019re dangling above a 10-kilometer hole in the Earth,\u201d she said of her trip more than 32,000 feet below the Pacific\u2019s surface in 2022 to research a trench north of New Zealand.",
      "\u201cYou have a small window that is only 12 centimeters in diameter that you can look out of. You can\u2019t stretch your legs while you\u2019re sitting on a little bench in a small titanium sphere, which is only 1.8 meters wide,\u201d she said, or about 6 feet.",
      "She said she was shocked by what she saw at the bottom of the trench, through the submersible\u2019s 4.7-inch window.",
      "\u201cWhen I got to go down, and we actually settled down on the ocean floor to have a look, I was stunned to see how much life and how many animals there were,\u201d she said.",
      "There has been little doubt that life could exist at these depths, but what took the research team by surprise was the sheer abundance of the ecosystem they found.",
      "The discoveries \u201cchallenge current models of life at extreme limits\u201d and show that these ecosystems might be more widespread than previously thought, they wrote."

      "He also said that with just a few hours to go before his self-imposed midnight deadline for trade deals, it was \"too late\" for other countries to avoid tariff rates set to snap in place next week, which he formalized in a new executive order.",
      "But, he added, his door will always be open to compelling offers: \"It doesn\u2019t mean that somebody doesn\u2019t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.\"",

      "Trump\u2019s order unilaterally sets rates \u2014 which are set to go into effect Aug. 7 \u2014 for trading partners that didn\u2019t reach agreements with him.

      "Trump indicated that he was open to further discussions with Canada and said he may even speak to Prime Minister Mark Carney later Thursday night, but he said he wouldn't make a new deal with the country before the deadline.",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday formalized the array of high tariff levels and trade deals he has announced in recent weeks, the latest escalation in his attempt to disrupt and reshape the global economic order.",
      "In a sweeping executive order, Trump made official his agreements with prominent trading partners such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines.",
      "Trump told NBC News in an exclusive interview that his door will always be open to compelling offers: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that somebody doesn\u2019t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.\u201d",
      "Trump's order, which came hours before a self-imposed deadline for trade deals, also unilaterally sets rates for trading partners that did not reach agreements with him, for example, Israel, Switzerland and Taiwan. Switzerland's rate will be set higher than previously threatened, at 39%, while Taiwan's will be set lower, at 20%.",
      "It\u2019s effectively a reset of the world\u2019s trade relations, one that is ostensibly designed to benefit the United States with expensive tariff rates not seen in nearly a century.",
      "Trump believes taxes on imported goods will erase trade deficits and bring back manufacturing to the United States. He has touted the $125 billion in revenue his already-existent import taxes have brought in, with hundreds of billions more pledged by a handful of countries in the form of investments. Yet it has come at the cost of slower economic growth and the prospect that already-stubborn inflation will reheat.",
      "Trump's order Thursday says the new duties will not take effect until Aug. 7.",
      "Goods shipped by vessel will not be affected by the new tariff rates until Oct. 5. Those products would need to be shipped by Aug. 7, but if importers don't take them out of the port or a warehouse for sale, the new rates won't apply for months. Items arriving on ships account for more than half of U.S. imports, according to the Transportation Department.",
      "Trump and top administration officials had insisted this week there would be no further delays after the 12:01 a.m. ET Friday deadline. In fact, just hours before the White House released Thursday\u2019s executive order, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick shouted to reporters outside the White House that there would be \u201cno extension\u201d to the deadline.",
      "But earlier Thursday, Trump did agree to a 90-day extension on talks with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Mexico is the United States' largest individual trading partner. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told CNBC on Thursday morning that he and Trump would be discussing an extension of China\u2019s tariff deadline, which is coming up on Aug. 12. And Lutnick said days ago that countries could keep talking with the Trump administration after the Friday deadline.",
      "With the newly signed tariffs not taking effect right away, uncertainty is likely to linger for consumers and businesses trying to plan for the rest of the year and beyond.",
      "\u201cSome will argue higher tariffs will be compensated by lower uncertainty,\u201d analysts with Bank of America wrote in a note to clients this week upon the announcement of an agreement with the European Union. \u201cAnd yes, uncertainty could come down in the near term, but we doubt it will go away.\u201d",
      "An unnamed manufacturer in a Dallas Federal Reserve survey released this week put it bluntly: \u201cTariffs. Tariffs. Tariffs. Did I mention tariffs?\u201d",
      "Inflation and the Fed",
      "As the new tariffs keep the economy on edge for two more months, the Federal Reserve will also try to work out what the effects will be.",
      "On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's policymakers thought there was still \"a long way to go to really understand\" what the effects will be and how the duties will play out. That could mean interest rates are likely to remain on hold.",
      "Powell laid out his thinking, saying: \" If you move too soon, you wind up maybe not getting inflation all the way fixed and you have to come back. That's inefficient. If you move too late, you might do unnecessary damage to the labor market.\"",
      "Even during Powell's news conference, Trump announced more tariffs on copper imports.",
      "Inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, and it has started to tick up recently. In June, the consumer price index rose to a 2.7% annual rate, up from 2.4% in May and 2.3% in April.",
      "Further delays to introducing the new tariff rates could lead to another rush of imports into the country. That, in turn, could also temporarily affect economic data, making it harder for policy makers to set interest rates or for businesses to plan.",
      "How we got here",
      "Trump initially delayed the tariffs he unveiled in the spring, prompted by a historic market sell-off following his April 2 announcement. The Trump administration then vowed 90 deals in 90 days. It has been more than 90 days, and there are nowhere near 90 deals.  Instead, Trump has announced just a handful of agreements and unilaterally imposed tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "One country, Brazil, is now subject to more punitive measures in the form of a 50% tariff that Trump pegged to coup charges brought against former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. Another, South Korea, was allowed to \u201cbuy\u201d its way to a 15% duty, down from a threatened 25%, by pledging massive investments into the United States. Indonesia and the Philippines were also the subjects of deal announcements.",
      "According to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, the average effective tariff rate will stand at about 18%. Tariffs are a tax on imports \u2014 and, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertions, the country of origin isn\u2019t directly responsible for paying the tax. Instead, the cost of the tariffs tends to get picked up by the importing company \u2014 and ultimately, in many cases, U.S. consumers. The Budget Lab says they add about 2% to price indexes, which it calculates as equivalent to more than $2,000 per year for a typical U.S. household.",
      "The Trump administration is banking on a return of production jobs to the United States as tariffs increase the cost of imports. So far, there has been little evidence of a pick-up in manufacturing employment \u2014 though some of that is attributable to the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to hold rates steady. Still, the National Association of Manufacturers has continued to call for \u201czero for zero\u201d tariffs that reduce trade barriers on both sides.",
      "And while the S&P 500 has returned to all-time highs, it has been showing signs of losing momentum and was on pace for a losing week despite blowout reports from the tech firms that now make up increasing proportions of the index.",
      "Tariffs have so far raised billions in government revenues that will help shave the federal deficit \u2014 but will come nowhere near to creating a surplus. Even House GOP members said in a release this year that when it comes to the United States\u2019 fiscal imbalances, \u201crevenues are not the problem.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, measures of inflation continue to pick up, raising the prospect of stagflation. The National Retail Federation has said tariffs \u201cthreaten the American dream\u201d while hurting small businesses.",
      "The Friday deadline was designed to bring renewed certainty. Instead, businesses are having to accept \u201can uptick in relative certainty,\u201d said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers financial group. If there is a silver lining, it is that tariffs may be largely affecting the pace of price growth for goods, not services \u2014 and services now power most of the U.S. economy.",
      "\u201cBack in April we thought we\u2019d go into a recession because of tariff levels that high \u2014 that will move the needle,\u201d Torres said. \u201cRight now, the landscape is quite buoyant.\u201d",
      "Yet Torres said Trump was likely to be unable to put tariffs questions fully behind him even after Friday\u2019s deadline, especially if countries start to pique his ire. Already, Trump announced another 90-day extension for previously negotiated tariff levels on Mexican imports, many of which are exempt thanks to the pre-existing USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m expecting it to remain somewhat of a theme,\u201d Torres said, noting that the swing states that helped deliver Trump back into the Oval Office continue to clamber for manufacturing jobs. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to deliver on that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement is newly flush with billions from the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d spending legislation and under pressure to rapidly hire 10,000 new agents. But one tactic it recently tried to do that hiring \u2014 aggressively recruiting new agents from some of its most trusted local law enforcement partners \u2014 may have alienated some of the leaders it needs to help execute what the Trump administration wants to be the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re their force multipliers, and this is the thanks we get for helping them do their job?\u201d Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd said in an interview. Judd said he\u2019s not happy about a recruitment email ICE\u2019s deputy director sent to hundreds of his deputies, and he blamed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE.",
      "\u201cKristi Noem needs to get on her big girl pants and do what\u2019s right. She needs to make sure that there\u2019s an apology,\u201d said Judd, who also made it clear that he wants to \u201csupport President Trump\u2019s mission.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to local law enforcement leaders in four states whose agencies participate in ICE\u2019s 287(g) program, under which local officers are deputized to help in immigration enforcement, and whose deputies ICE targeted for recruitment.",
      "The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.",
      "The email, which NBC News has obtained, reads, in part: \u201cAs someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law. Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission \u2014qualities we need now more than ever.\u201d",
      "The email also touts potential $50,000 signing bonuses as an incentive for joining ICE, and it links to a government recruitment website featuring an image of Uncle Sam, the headline \u201cAMERICA NEEDS YOU\u201d and the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment beyond the signing bonuses.",
      "\u201cICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership,\u201d the Pinellas County, Florida, Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement.",
      "The sheriff in Pinellas County is a Republican, as is Judd.",
      "\u201cIt was bad judgment that will cause an erosion of a relationship that has been improving of late. And it\u2019s going to take some getting over, and it\u2019s going to take leadership at DHS to really take stock, \u2019cause, hey, they need state and locals,\u201d Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, said in an interview.",
      "Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails. He also said that the group has not heard from DHS since the emails were flagged to the association and that he intends to send a \u201cvery stern note\u201d to ICE.",
      "\u201cThis is inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same boat. And you just don\u2019t treat friends or partners like this.\u201d",
      "One Florida police chief who did not want to be named out of concern that his department could face retaliation said departments that have partnered with the federal government now fear they could lose their best officers.",
      "\u201cNow you know why everybody\u2019s so pissed,\u201d the chief said.",
      "\u201cThis is like the transfer portal in college sports,\u201d the chief said, adding: \u201cWe see people leave us because they believe they can make more money at other locations. ... Law enforcement has always been a calling. Now it\u2019s a job.\u201d",
      "The DHS media office did not respond to questions about local law enforcement concerns but provided NBC News with a statement that it attributed to a senior DHS official: \u201cICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country. ... This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience. Additionally, more than $500 million from President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill will go to increasing our 287(g) partnerships with state and local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, told NBC News that the Atlanta ICE office \u201csent an apology\u201d for the recruitment email.",
      "Not all sheriffs are upset with the recruitment effort. In fact, some say they support it.",
      "Thaddeus Cleveland, the sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, said, \u201cI think if someone wants to better their life, better their career, you know, look towards the long years, the long game, retirement, there\u2019s nothing better than the U.S. government to go out and have a successful career.\u201d",
      "Cleveland, who has just four deputies, admits he cannot compete with the $50,000 bonuses the agency is offering.",
      "\u201cWe may not be able to turn around and hire somebody the next day. It may take a few weeks. It may take a few months. But again, I support, you know, someone wanting to pursue something they\u2019re interested in. I may end up having to work a little more, which is OK.\u201d",
      "Goliad County, Texas, Sheriff Roy Boyd also said he is not upset about the recruitment and noted that his office also has to deal with the state\u2019s recruiting new troopers from his department.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t compete with the salaries of the state and the feds,\u201d he said."

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, our team looks at Trump\u2019s tariff agenda on the eve of his deadline for reimposing some of the duties he announced and then delayed in April, as well as a legal case looming over all of the tariffs. Meanwhile, Jonathan Allen outlines the thought process that awaits Kamala Harris ahead of the 2028 election.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Scott Bland",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs face another inflection point, and a court test",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s most sweeping tariffs, the ones he originally announced in April, are set to go into effect (again) on Friday. But on Thursday, his whole tariff agenda faced a stern test in federal court, NBC News\u2019 Steve Kopack reports.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, though they were allowed to stay in place pending appeal. The court said the law Trump cited in many of his executive orders did not \u201cdelegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.\u201d",
      "It also said the tariffs did not meet the test of interceding against an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d risk to the country, after Trump implemented them by claiming a national emergency.",
      "All of Trump\u2019s tariffs on major trading partners, such as Canada, Mexico, China, the European Union, Japan, India, Brazil and a handful of other countries, have been deployed using the law.",
      "On Thursday, an appeals court took a skeptical view of the Trump administration\u2019s argument that imposing the tariffs is well within the president\u2019s authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, per NBC News\u2019 Ryan Balberman. Some of the judges noted that Trump\u2019s use of the law effectively cuts Congress out of tariff policy, though the law doesn\u2019t mention tariffs.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump extended the deadline for negotiations with Mexico before imposing new tariffs there. He\u2019s hit India, Brazil and South Korea with new tariffs as the deadline looms.",
      "Altogether, as NBC News\u2019 Rob Wile and Steve Kopack write, since the April tariff rate announcement Trump dubbed \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d the president backed down \u2014 and since then has steadily been reintroducing elevated tariffs at levels not seen since the 1930s.",
      "What\u2019s next? We\u2019ll find out more on Friday. And more still when that appeals court makes its decision.",
      "What Kamala Harris will weigh ahead of 2028",
      "There are more than 2 million reasons for Kamala Harris not to run for president again: That\u2019s the margin she lost by in 2024.",
      "Moreover, no Democrat has lost a general election and come back to win the presidency since Grover Cleveland in 1892. The last Democrat to win the party\u2019s nomination, lose the general election and come back to win the nomination four years later was Adlai Stevenson in 1956.",
      "But what may ultimately be more compelling to Harris are the arguments for mounting a third bid for the Oval Office in 2028. In passing on a run for governor of California this week, she said that \u201cfor now,\u201d her focus is not on elective office. That left open the door to a future campaign, and there\u2019s only one job above the one the former vice president held most recently.",
      "If Harris does hope to make a comeback, she will have to reckon with the most glaring deficiency of the 107-day campaign she ran in the shadow of President Joe Biden: She didn\u2019t articulate a clear vision for the country that met the needs of voters who were dissatisfied with his leadership. While she has time to hear voters, develop an agenda and brush up her presentation skills, she would have to devote herself to executing on those goals to win a primary and the presidency.",
      "Still, Harris would walk into a primary race with a set of advantages over most of her rivals. For starters, and for better or worse, everyone in her party knows who she is. Most candidates have to spend exorbitant amounts of time and money to build name recognition outside their states. That\u2019s not a problem for Harris, who received more than 75 million votes in 2024.",
      "Candidates also have to spend money on television ads and field operations, which can be prohibitively expensive. Harris would start the race with the strongest record of raising money \u2014 much of it attributable, of course, to the fact that she was the party\u2019s nominee \u2014 and the biggest list of donors. Again, she would start the race farther down the track than prospective opponents.",
      "In her 2024 and 2020 campaigns, the latter of which actually ended in 2019 when she ran out of money and support, Harris showed she had a lot to learn about creating and communicating a message. In 2028, she would not be dealing with the scrutiny of the national media and the exhausting crunch of day-to-day campaigning for the first time. Again, these are edges she would have over first-timers.",
      "One question she will have to answer for herself \u2014 and it\u2019s one that helped dissuade Hillary Clinton from running in 2020 \u2014 is whether she would still run if she were convinced she could win the nomination but was unlikely to defeat a Republican in November.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of time for Harris to determine her own appetite for another campaign, the electorate\u2019s interest in her and the pure political calculation of her chances of ending up in the White House. It may be that Americans have seen the last of Harris on a ballot.",
      "But while a Democrat last avenged a defeat in the distant past, one very present politician did it less than a year ago: Donald J. Trump.",
      "Elon Musk gives millions to Republican super PACs ahead of the midterms",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk may be gone from President Donald Trump\u2019s White House, but he may not be done with Republican politics.",
      "Musk made a pair of $5 million donations on June 27 to the main super PACs backing House and Senate Republicans. That made Musk the largest individual donor to both groups in the first six months of 2025, according to new campaign finance reports filed Thursday.",
      "The new contributions are further proof of how Musk can make a big splash in politics by putting his signature on just one check. And they raise the question of how much more there might be before the midterms, despite Musk\u2019s messy post-White House breakup with Trump and his statements in July about starting a third party, made after the donations.",
      "Musk\u2019s June 27 donations supporting the Senate Leadership Fund and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the two GOP super PACs, came about a month after leaving his official post as an adviser to Trump and days before he began publicly discussing the idea of starting a new political party.",
      "Meanwhile, other new campaign finance reports show Musk pumped $45.3 million into his own super PAC in the first six months of this year. The tech billionaire gave nearly $17.9 million directly to the group and sent another $27.4 million in in-kind contributions, with Musk covering funds for million-dollar prizes to voters who signed petitions.",

      "Virginia Giuffre, the woman who survived years of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse and died by suicide this year, wanted the so-called Epstein files released, her siblings said.",
      "\"She had a little bit of hope in her because it was said that the files were going to be released,\" Amanda Roberts, Giuffre's sister-in-law, said in an interview Thursday, adding that she thinks Giuffre would have wanted \"transparency and justice.\"",
      "\"She was fighting for that to happen right up until the very end,\" Roberts said. \"She wanted the public to know the crimes that they had committed.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Giuffre has been in the headlines amid a renewed push for the release of a trove of documents that allegedly detail the years of abuse by Epstein and his longtime partner Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "\"We've constantly had to relive, since my sister's passing, these things from her past,\" said Danny Wilson, one of Giuffre's brothers.",
      "Asked specifically Tuesday whether Giuffre was among the people Epstein had \"stolen\" from the spa at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, President Donald Trump said: \"I think that was one of the people. He stole her.\"",
      "Giuffre was a locker room attendant at the Florida club in the summer of 2000, when she was 16.",
      "The White House has said Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago \"for being a creep.\"",
      "Epstein died in what was ruled a suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Sky Roberts, Giuffre's other brother, said the family was \"shocked\" by Trump's use of the word \"stolen\" to describe their sister. He said it makes him wonder how much Trump knew about what Epstein was doing.",
      "\"She's not an object; she's a person,\" he said through tears. \"She's a mom. She's a sister. And she was recruited by Maxwell. She wasn't stolen.\"",
      "Trump was asked last week about pardoning Maxwell and responded that he hadn't thought about it but that he's \"allowed to do it.\"",
      "Maxwell's attorney, David Oscar Markus, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about the interview. Last week, Markus said there had been \"no asks and no promises\" about clemency but added that his client \"would welcome any relief.\"",
      "Giuffre's family urged Trump in a statement not to pardon Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role recruiting and trafficking minors for sex.",
      "The family said they put out the statement because Trump \"invoked\" their sister's name and that in her absence they felt they needed to represent her wishes.",
      "Lanette Wilson, Giuffre's sister-in-law, said Thursday a pardon of Maxwell would be an \"abomination,\" because \"our sister always told us that Maxwell was even worse than Epstein.\"",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News on Wednesday that \"no leniency is being given or discussed.\" The family said Thursday that they are relieved the administration does not appear to be exploring that option for Maxwell.",
      "Sky Roberts said a pardon would \"unwind everything that my sister and all the survivors fought for.\"",
      "Amanda Roberts said: \"It's really important that we create a culture ... for victims and survivors to come forward, to protect them, to trust them and believe them. Survivors deserve the space to be heard always, and that if you were to let [Maxwell] free, it would be silencing them all over again, and that is not a culture that any of us want.\"",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk may be gone from President Donald Trump\u2019s White House, but he may not be done with Republican politics.",
      "Musk made a pair of $5 million donations on June 27 to the main super PACs backing House and Senate Republicans. That made Musk the largest individual donor to both groups in the first six months of 2025, according to new campaign finance reports filed Thursday.",
      "He also sent $5 million on the same day to MAGA Inc., Trump's super PAC.",
      "The new contributions are further proof of how Musk can make a big splash in politics by putting his signature on just one check. And they raise the question of how much more there might be before the midterms, despite Musk\u2019s messy post-White House breakup with Trump and his statements in July about starting a third party, made after the donations.",
      "Musk\u2019s June 27 donations supporting the Senate Leadership Fund and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the two GOP super PACs, came about a month after leaving his official post as an adviser to Trump and days before he began publicly discussing the idea of starting a new political party after the passage of Trump's big domestic spending bill.",
      "In between, he had feuded with Trump online, even attacking Trump for his past personal ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Meanwhile, other new campaign finance reports show Musk pumped $45.3 million into his own super PAC in the first six months of this year. The tech billionaire gave nearly $17.9 million directly to the group and sent another $27.4 million in in-kind contributions, with Musk covering funds for million-dollar prizes to voters who signed petitions.",
      "America PAC spent $47.3 million in the first six months of the year, including $15.5 million through the first week of April, when the group was heavily involved in the April 1 elections for the Wisconsin state Supreme Court and special House elections in Florida.",
      "The group reported spending $6 million on canvassing and field operations, as well as a few million dollars on digital ads, mailers and phone calls.",
      "The full scope of Musk\u2019s giving in the first half of 2025 isn\u2019t clear yet \u2014 super PACs will continue filing fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday ahead of a midnight filing deadline, and many other groups involved in politics never have to disclose their donors.",
      "Musk spent approximately a quarter-billion dollars in the 2024 election, given largely in support of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "Thursday\u2019s America PAC filing covers fundraising and spending from Jan. 1 through June 30. It\u2019s unclear whether Musk used his super PAC for anything related to his July pledge to start a new political party, which came after the period covered by the new report.",
      "Musk spent about five months in the White House as an adviser to Trump and the public face of the president\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d initiative. But he\u2019s had a rocky relationship with Trump since the final days of his official tenure, repeatedly criticizing the White House\u2019s signature tax cut and spending bill."

      "The percentage of kids who didn't get their recommended childhood vaccines rose again last school year, continuing the post-pandemic trend of Americans opting out of vaccinations.",
      "During the 2024-25 school year, 4.1% of kindergartners \u2014 about 138,000 kids \u2014 had a vaccine exemption, surpassing the previous record high of 3.7% during the prior school year.",
      "Nearly all exemptions are listed as nonmedical, meaning the kids aren\u2019t getting vaccines for religious or other personal reasons.",
      "The data, reported Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, comes as 2025 has logged the highest number of measles cases in 33 years: 1,333 cases in 39 states.",
      "Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC, said he expects the rate of vaccination exemptions to continue to rise as long as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 a long-time anti-vaccine activist \u2014 is health and human services secretary.",
      "\u201cWhile these numbers are bad, they don\u2019t even begin to reflect the impact that Secretary Kennedy will have on future exemptions,\u201d Besser said. \u201cNo one has done more to instill fear and distrust of vaccines.\u201d",
      "HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an email, \u201cThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications,\u201d Nixon said, adding that a family\u2019s decision to vaccinate is \u201ca personal one.\u201d",
      "Approximately 286,000 kindergartners last school year had no documentation that they\u2019d ever had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the CDC said.",
      "Those children were toddlers when the pandemic hit in 2020. The MMR vaccine is given in two doses beginning at age 1.",
      "Just 92.5% of kids had their MMR and polio shots last year, and 92.1% had been vaccinated against tetanus and whooping cough.",
      "Both percentages are decreases from the year before.",
      "\u201cA drop in coverage like that can make a huge difference for keeping a disease like measles at bay,\u201d said Josh Michaud, an associate director within the Global Health Policy program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization. \u201cLower measles vaccination rates are a key driver for outbreaks like the ones we\u2019re seeing across many states this year.\u201d",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious viruses on Earth. Generally, 95% of the community must be vaccinated against it to prevent outbreaks.",
      "While states have different vaccination requirements for attending public and most private schools, they generally include MMR, poliovirus and chickenpox vaccines, as well as DTaP, which covers diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (also called whooping cough)."

      "The project, set to begin in September, looms as the biggest transformation of the White House complex since Harry Truman\u2019s day. Perhaps fitting for the onetime New York real estate developer who branded buildings worldwide with his name, Trump has taken to remaking the White House in accord with his tastes since beginning his second term.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that the new ballroom will forgo the need to shuttle guests to tents pitched on the South Lawn for events that are too large for the White House to accommodate.",

      "A Maine resort town is challenging the Trump administration\u2019s criticism of its police department after a seasonal reserve officer was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. The incident is putting renewed focus on the accuracy of E-Verify, the system the federal government created for employers to check if prospective employees have legal authorization to work in the United States.",
      "Federal immigration officials have asserted that the Old Orchard Beach Police Department either \u201cknowingly\u201d hired an unauthorized immigrant as a reserve officer or did not do enough independent verification of the man\u2019s status. The department has said it thoroughly checked the background of Jon-Luke Evans, and he was approved to work there as an officer in May through the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s E-Verify Program.",
      "ICE said it arrested Evans, a Jamaican citizen, last Friday after he unlawfully attempted to buy a firearm, triggering an alert with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which worked with ICE to make the arrest. ICE said that Evans overstayed a visa that required him to leave in October 2023. But the town's police department said E-verify cleared Evans' work eligibility until March of 2030.",
      "\u201cThe Old Orchard Beach Police Department follows all of the pre-employment guidelines expected of an employer in the State of Maine and in the U.S., and we are providing this additional information in response to statements made by certain federal agencies that only work to undermine public trust and confidence in municipal law enforcement,\u201d the town's manager, Diana Asanza, said in a joint statement with the police department on Wednesday evening.",
      "\u201cToday, the Department of Homeland Security doubled down on its attack, but in doing so has thrown its own electronic verification system into question. If we should not trust the word of the federal computer system that verifies documents and employment eligibility, what good is that system?\u201d Asanza said.",
      "The joint statement came after DHS said earlier Wednesday that using E-Verify \u201cdoes not absolve employers of their legal duty to verify documentation authenticity, and all employers should take necessary steps to effectively verify legal employment status.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Old Orchard Beach Police Department\u2019s reckless reliance on E-Verify to justify arming an illegal alien, Jon Luke Evans, violates federal law, and does not absolve them of their failure to conduct basic background checks to verify legal status,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.",
      "McLaughlin also defended the E-Verify system, saying it \u201cis a proven, no-cost tool that delivers high accuracy in verifying work authorization by cross-checking employee documents against government databases to combat rampant document fraud and protecting American workers.\u201d",
      "E-Verify is operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the Social Security Administration.",
      "After McLaughlin issued the DHS statement, Old Orchard Beach released a statement of its own detailing the steps it took to verify Evans' immigration status and eligibility to work.",
      "The town said that before the police department hired Evans, it compiled a 153-page personnel file on him that included background checks, driving records, copies of identification cards, education and medical records, and personal references.",
      "Evans provided required information including an I-9 federal immigration and work authorization form, as well as his Jamaican birth certificate, Massachusetts driver\u2019s license, U.S. social security card, work authorization card, among other documents, according to the statement.",
      "\u201cThe Old Orchard Beach Police Department thoroughly checked Mr. Evans\u2019 background and verified that all information and documentation he provided was accurate. The depth of his personnel file shows the diligence the Town takes in hiring,\u201d Police Chief Elise Chard said.",
      "It said it then submitted Evans\u2019 forms to DHS\u2019 E-Verify program, and in May the federal agency verified Evans\u2019 status and said he was authorized to work legally through March 19, 2030.",
      "\u201cEvans would not have been permitted to begin work in Old Orchard Beach without DHS verifying his status. The federal government has aggressively pushed all employers \u2014 government and private \u2014 to rely on E-Verify in the hiring process,\u201d the town and police department said.",
      "\u201cSimply stated, had the federal government flagged his information the Town would not have hired Mr. Evans,\u201d Chard said. \u201cAny insinuation that the Town and Department were derelict in our efforts to verify Mr. Evans\u2019 eligibility to work for the Town is false and appears to be an attempt to shift the blame onto a hard-working local law enforcement agency that has done its job.\u201d",
      "The policed released 54 pages of his personnel file, which NBC News has reviewed, showing records related to his police department application process, which state that employment is conditional upon a background check, the submission of mandatory paperwork, drug screening and mandatory training sessions. The records also show Evans was required to provide two valid forms of ID for payroll processing and that he passed all of his training sessions before he was approved to work as a reserve officer. The documents also include Evans\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and educational records.",
      "DHS did not respond to requests for comment on the Old Orchard Beach town and police department statement. It also did not share what steps and methods, beyond E-Verify, it suggests local police departments and other employers use to independently verify an immigrant applicant\u2019s legal status and work authorization.",
      "ICE had accused the police department of \u201cknowingly breaking the law\u201d and hiring an immigrant in the country illegally. The police department denied the claim, saying the federal government\u2019s own system had approved the man to work as a reserve officer.",
      "Rep. Lori\u202fK.\u202fGramlich, a Democrat who represents Old Orchard Beach in the state House of Representatives, said in a statement Thursday that in light of the conflicting accounts, she was calling for a thorough federal review of E-Verify and DHS\u2019 authorization process \u201cthat allowed Officer Evans to begin work in good faith in May 2025.",
      "\u201cThis incident highlights the importance and necessity of reliable federal systems to support the lawful employment of noncitizen residents in community-serving roles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must do better to prevent such situations in the future, protect community trust and ensure fairness and accountability.\u201d",
      "Melissa Azallion Kenny, a partner at the firm Burr & Forman who specializes in immigration law, said that in her experience working with clients, when a prospective employees\u2019 information is properly entered into the E-Verify system, it is usually accurate in confirming employment authorization. But in general, there have been instances of both false positives and false negatives, including potentially cases of identity fraud, she said.",
      "Azallion Kenny said that while all the facts aren\u2019t fully known or public in the Maine case, if she were counseling an employer who had fully and accurately completed an I-9 form, thoroughly gone through the E-Verify system and done the checks the police department said it conducted, \u201cI would at least feel confident that I could provide some sort of good faith defense\u201d to demonstrate the employer did everything it could do to comply.",
      "Maine is one of about a dozen states that allow noncitizens to work in law enforcement. Some require an immigrant to be a green-card holder, while others, such as Maine, require an immigrant to be legally authorized to work in the U.S.",
      "The town has said that its police department, like many in coastal communities, uses a seasonal supplementary workforce when the population surges in the summer months.",
      "Maine has some 34,000 immigrant workers, or 4.6% of the state\u2019s labor force, according to the American Immigration Council. There are also an estimated 5,800 unauthorized immigrants of working age in the state, according to the council."

      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",
      "Basics and groceries",
      "Tide Pods Liquid Laundry Detergent (76-Count)",
      "During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble\u2019s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",
      "Kosterina Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",
      "Technology",
      "Apple AirPods 4 with ANC",
      "Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 for two months, says they\u2019re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. \u201cThese are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.\u201d",
      "JBL Clip 5",
      "The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team\u2019s go-to Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the audio quality is impressive for the device\u2019s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant.",
      "Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con",
      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep.",
      "Clothes and shoes",
      "Gap Organic Cotton VintageSoft T-Shirt",
      "I buy basics from Gap every time they\u2019re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it.",
      "501\u00ae Original Fit Men's Jeans",
      "These Levi\u2019s jeans, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u2019s for over 6 years now,\u201d says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. \u201cI love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There\u2019s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.\u201d",
      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cstrategic.\u201d The brand didn\u2019t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord.",
      "Adidas Samba OG Sneaker",
      "Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas\u2019 most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole.",
      "Birkenstock Arizona",
      "Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand\u2019s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There\u2019s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand.",
      "Under Armour Charged Surge 4 Sneaker",
      "During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it\u2019s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We\u2019ve tested lots of Under Armour\u2019s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, is a basic shoe that\u2019s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool.",
      "Home and kitchen",
      "Ninja AF101 Air Fryer",
      "SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company\u2019s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",
      "Sproos! Handheld Showerhead with Filter Set",
      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",
      "Will retailers raise prices due to tariffs?",
      "Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now:",

      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China and Mexico are also in ongoing talks with the U.S. about tariffs \u2014 China's pause on duties expires on Aug. 12 and Mexico's pause expires at the end of October.",

      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",

But the highly coveted Bonne Maman Advent Calendar is officially back for its ninth year, and it\u2019s likely not going to be in-stock for long. I\u2019ve been writing about (and buying) it for years, and I guarantee it will sell-out before the holiday season So if you already know you want one, I recommend securing it now before it\u2019s too late.",
      "Bonne Maman Advent Calendar",
      "This 24-day Advent calendar comes with mini numbered boxes, each of which has a mini  jar of jam in a limited-edition flavor. Leading up to whatever holiday you celebrate, you\u2019ll be able to try spreads like caramel with coffee, mango and ginger, pear and mandarin with cinnamon, blueberry with maple and strawberry with passion fruit. The Advent calendar\u2019s box is decorated with a festive holiday scene, so you can keep it out at home and use it as decor.",
      "As a Bonne Maman loyalist, I look forward to opening its Advent calendar every winter and expanding my palate with uniquely flavored jams I can\u2019t find at the grocery store any other time of year. I add the spreads to toast and swirl them into plain greek yogurt, as well as bake Linzer tart and thumbprint cookies with them. I always clean and save the mini jars after I try all the flavors \u2014 they\u2019re adorable and perfect for putting condiments and dips in on-the-go.",

    "story": [
      "When people think of wearables, a few names usually come up: Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit, Garmin. Whoop is usually not on that list: it\u2019s a smaller brand that appeals to a specific crowd as opposed to the Apple Watch and Fitbit users of the world.",
      "And yet, most people, myself included, will inevitably compare it to an Apple Watch. After all, most people will wear one, not both. That\u2019s why I wore the latest Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 at the same time for over a month: to see how they compare, and which one is right for you.",

      "Whoop offers three products: Whoop One ($199 a year), Whoop Peak ($239 a year) and Whoop Life ($359 a year), each with their own distinct differences in software and hardware.",
      "Whoop One and Whoop Peak use the same physical Whoop band, but Whoop Peak users have more software features in the app. Whoop Life uses the Whoop MG (Medical Grade) band, which has a more advanced sensor with ECG and AFib detection.",
      "Apple sells the Apple Watch SE ($249), Apple Watch Series 10 ($399) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ($799). I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 for this comparison, as it is the closest direct competitor to the Whoop, in my view.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "My experience using Whoop and Apple Watch",
      "Whoop and Apple Watch are very different devices for very different people. Both are comfortable to wear and give interesting and mostly accurate health, sleep and fitness insights. But the experience of using them is wildly different, and highlights how they are meant for different kinds of people. Below are some of the key differences between the two.",
      "Whoop is essentially a screenless watch band. The included band is made of a flexible, comfortable yarn, and the sensor itself attaches to the band with a titanium clasp. It\u2019s comfortable, subtle and easy to forget when you are wearing it, plus it looks relatively normal in more formal settings (unlike some smartwatches). The clasp can be a little finicky when taking the Whoop on and off your wrist. Unlike most other wearables, you can wear the Whoop MG (or 5.0) on your bicep using the Whoop Bicep Band, but it hasn\u2019t been released at the time of writing this comparison.",
      "The Whoop MG gets up to 14 days of battery life, which is excellent. This made it easy to forget I was wearing it most of the time.",
      "You charge the Whoop MG using the wireless charging puck, which slides and clicks into place on top of the clasp. It takes about two hours to fully charge, which is pretty slow. You can, however, keep wearing the Whoop MG while it\u2019s charging, though this makes it much heavier and bulkier. I think you\u2019ll either love the wireless charging puck or hate it. One the one hand: it means you never have to take off your Whoop, even to charge. On the other hand, it\u2019s slow, feels  bulky on your wrist and is easier to lose compared to a more standard wireless charging station.",
      "You\u2019re probably familiar with the Apple Watch, and the Series 10 is similar to models before it. It\u2019s thinner and lighter than the Apple Watch Series 9, but ekes out more screen space by reaching further into the edges of the case. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear daily, and you can choose from dozens of bands to maximize comfort or better fit the occasion.",
      "Improvements over the Series 9 include a brighter screen that is easier to see at off-angles and faster charging \u2014 up to 80% charge in 30 minutes (or 100% in an hour). Total battery life is still about 18 hours, though.",
      "My take: This is mostly about battery life and whether you want a screen or not. I barely need to think about battery life with the Whoop MG, and charging is relatively flexible. The Apple Watch needs to be charged almost daily, but it\u2019s a fully-featured smartwatch, with all the features that entails.",
      "Day-to-day",
      "Whoop",
      "Using the Whoop MG feels like a middle ground between the mostly passive Oura Ring ($349) and the arguably over-active Ultrahuman Ring ($349). It offers some notifications, like reminders about tonight\u2019s optimal bedtime for ideal recovery, but it leaves most control in your hands to open the app and explore your data when you want to, not when the app tells you to. Like the Oura Ring, the Whoop MG has automatic workout detection, though you can also open up the app to manually start and stop workouts as they happen.",
      "Apple",
      "An Apple Watch can be as active or as passive as you want it to be. You can have all your smartphone notifications synced, and get pings every time you get a text, emails or app notification. You can also turn everything off, and treat it as a watch that\u2019s also a fitness and sleep tracker \u2014 it\u2019s up to you.",
      "It\u2019s easy to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch because it has a screen \u2014 you don\u2019t need to pull out your phone. It also automatically detects some workouts, but will prompt you on screen when it does, which makes it easier to know when to start a workout yourself.",
      "My take: I think the Apple Watch is more flexible here. With a couple of minutes in its setting menu, you can make it as hands on or as hands off as you want. Whoop is a more focused product than the Apple Watch, so its day-to-day experience is more one-size-fits-all.",
      "Whoop",
      "My Whoop MG tracked health, sleep and fitness data relatively accurately, and provided a lot more information to dig into than the Apple Watch in most cases, for better or worse.",
      "Sleep data between the Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 was similar, but the Whoop showed my sleep on a more granular level than the Apple Watch, with exact timings on wake windows and sleep stages.",
      "The Whoop MG does have automatic workout detection, but like the Oura Ring, I found myself starting and stopping workouts manually through the app. After my month of testing, I realized that while the automatic tracking is okay, I didn\u2019t trust it enough to risk not logging a workout or having inaccurate data about my runs or gym time.",
      "Apple",
      "The Apple Watch similarly tracks sleep, health and fitness data, but has more convenient exercise tracking than Whoop, especially outdoors. It has its own GPS built-in, so its outdoor walk, run and cycling workouts tend to be slightly (or significantly) more accurate than the Whoop, depending on the environment. It also has more detailed stats for runners like cadence, stride length and more.",
      "Again, because it has a screen, it\u2019s easier to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch. That screen is also useful for confirming or denying its automatic workout detection.",
      "My take: Both wearables track similar things. Whoop has the edge when it comes to sleep and health tracking, while Apple is easier and more accurate for exercise tracking.",
      "Metrics and analysis",
      "This is where things get interesting, and where the big differences between the Apple Watch and the Whoop MG reveal themselves.",
      "Whoop",
      "Whoop has three key metrics placed front and center on the Home tab: sleep, recovery and strain. Sleep is pretty self-explanatory, but recovery and strain are impressive but can be a bit confusing. Whoop assigns a strain score to all of your activities, and charts your strain across days, weeks and months. Strain is scored between zero and 21, which is very specific but can take some mental gymnastics when every other brand is using scales of zero to 10 or zero to 100. The specificity around strain and recovery was interesting to look at, but didn\u2019t feel too different from easy to understand features like Training Readiness and Training Status on some Garmin watches.",
      "The Health tab is where you will find most of the new features compared to the previous Whoop 4.0, and this is where I have the most mixed feelings.",
      "Clicking on the Health tab pulls up a slew of other metrics. You can track your respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and skin temperature. You can see trends in each overtime, from weeks to months, similar to my experience using the Oura Ring 4.",
      "But the biggest new feature is Healthspan. In the essay-length description of the feature on the Whoop app, Whoop calls Healthspan \u201cthe number of years you live in good health.\u201d It gives two measurements: your Whoop Age and your Pace of Aging. Both, but mostly Pace of Aging, fills me with dread and anxiety in a way no other wearable I\u2019ve tested has. I could argue this says more about my relationship with mortality than Whoop, but hear me out.",
      "Pace of Aging \u201creflects how quickly your Whoop Age is changing,\u201d says Whoop in its app. It charts it on a scale from -1.0x to 3.0x, \u201clike a speedometer.\u201d Over 1.0x? Your Whoop Age is increasing faster than your chronological age.",
      "Your Pace of Aging changes weekly, and Whoop would notify me every week that it changed. During my entire test period, my Whoop Age was younger than my actual age (likely a reflection of my fitness activity), but my Pace of Aging was consistently fast, usually at 1.4x. Whoop eventually explained that my Whoop Age and Pace of Aging are increasing because of my sleep consistency, and to \u201ckeep an eye on this trend to stay on track\u201d or else my Whoop Age may increase if \u201cyou keep up with your current behaviors.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the thing: I know why I get between five and 6.5 hours of interrupted sleep every night: it\u2019s because I live in a one bedroom and have a wonderful one year old. I would love to sleep eight hours uninterrupted every night, but most new parents know that that is a pipe dream. So Whoop telling me that my interrupted sleep is speeding up my aging was just frustrating.",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that Whoop Age and Whoop Pace of Aging ultimately cannot truly tell you how fast you are aging. It\u2019s far too complex a topic for Whoop, or any wearable, to track. Aging is affected by a myriad of factors Whoop either isn\u2019t including or can\u2019t track, including diet, lifestyle, genetics, mental health and underlying medical conditions, to name a few.",
      "Healthspan is a buzzy feature that made me open the Whoop app more than usual. But I don\u2019t think a feature that fills me with dread and anxiety is a win, especially one that is more of a suggestion than objective truth.",
      "Apple",
      "By comparison, metrics and analysis on the Apple Watch are much more grounded and reserved \u2014 it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near fitness age or aging with its data. It\u2019s solely focused on giving you your sleep, health and fitness data, without much suggestion or analysis.",
      "Metrics are spread across two apps: Apple Health and Apple Fitness. Apple Fitness shows you all your workouts, and has features like Training Load and Trends that chart things like exercise frequency, move goals, steps, pace and cardio fitness over time. Apple Health has the Vitals feature, which tracks your overnight heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature and sleep duration, and can tell you when your stats are out of normal range, indicating potential illness. Whoop does this too, but unfortunately for my testing (and fortunately for my health), I did not get sick during this comparison, so I couldn\u2019t test this feature.",
      "My take: Whoop MG gives you more metrics and analysis to look at than the Apple Watch. That\u2019s arguably the whole point of getting the Whoop: detailed strain, recovery and health data. My problem is that I either didn\u2019t find the analysis all that useful or it stressed me out (Healthspan). Apple Watch takes a \u201cjust the facts\u201d approach, with little to no analysis (outside of Vitals), just detailed metrics you can interpret on your own.",
      "Value",
      "My take: Normally I wouldn\u2019t harp on value too much: everyone has their own budget, and knows what they can and can\u2019t afford. But the Whoop subscription model is expensive, even compared to a premium product like the Apple Watch Series 10.",
      "A full-priced Series 10 is $399 (though it\u2019s often on sale for less). The lowest priced Whoop subscription is $199 a year. That means after just two years of use, the Whoop starts becoming more expensive than the Series 10.",
      "Everyone I know uses their wearables for four or five years. Four years of Whoop Life, the version I tested, is $1436. That\u2019s more than basically every wearable on the market.",
      "Whoop vs Apple Watch: The final verdict",
      "Whoop is a much more specific product than the Apple Watch \u2014 it\u2019s for a niche crowd who want a tracker with no screen, in-depth analysis and excellent battery life. If that sounds like you, give the Whoop a try \u2014 the brand has a one month free trial (though the trial does not include Healthspan features).",
      "Whoop is not for me, though. If I am wearing something on my wrist, I want it to have a screen so I can use my phone less. The Apple Watch Series 10 is one of the best wearables for anyone with an iPhone, as long as you don\u2019t mind charging it daily. In the long run, it\u2019s also much cheaper than any Whoop subscription.",

      "\u201cGoddammit, I hate it,\u201d he said, looking at the finished result.",
      "The \u201cAquaman\u201d star revealed he was shaving off his beard for the first time in six years as part of the preparation for his upcoming return to the \u201cDune\u201d franchise.",
      "\u201cThis is the kickoff, 'Dune 3,'\" he said, before referencing \"Dune\" director Denis Villeneuve by saying, \u201cOnly for you, Denis.\"",
      "During an March 31 appearance on TODAY, Momoa revealed he would reprise his role as the clean-shaven Duncan Idaho, a swordmaster of House Atreides and mentor to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Paul Atreides, in \u201cDune: Part Three.\u201d Momoa's character was killed off in 2021's \"Dune,\" and did not return in the 2024 sequel.",
      "Speaking to TODAY's Craig Melvin, Momoa confirmed he would be \u201cmaking a comeback.\u201d",
      "When asked if he would return in the same way as depicted in Frank Herbert\u2019s six-part \u201cDune\u201d book series, which shows Duncan Idaho resurrected in the form of a clone, Momoa did not offer much insight.",
      "\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to get in trouble or not, but it\u2019s the same thing like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019, you know what I mean?\u201d Momoa said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t read the books, it\u2019s not my fault, right? Yeah, there\u2019s going to be \u2026 I\u2019m going to be coming back.\u201d",
      "While \u201cDune\u201d fans will have to wait until Dec. 2026 to see Momoa's official return to the franchise, they did not hold back their thoughts on his new clean-shaven look in the comment section of his post.",
      "\"Am I the only one who likes 'no beard' ?? \ud83d\ude02,\" one person wrote.",
      "Another said, \u201cGreat you look so handsome omg Jason why do you hide your beautiful face \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.\u201d",
      "Some fans begged to differ, with one sharing three simple words about his beardless look: \u201cPut it back \ud83d\ude02.\u201d",
      "One fan, who noted his upcoming film, wrote,  \"\ud83d\ude2e\u2764\ufe0f Dune 3 is coming! You look handsome either way, I am a huge fan of the beard however! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
      "And another weighed in, writing, \"I like you better with a beard, you look more mature and serious. But work is work. And if you have to shave for the shoot, that\u2019s okay too. Without a beard, you look young and daring.\"",
      "The last time Momoa was seen shaving off his beard was in 2019 when he did a YouTube video to try and get people to \"switch to INFINITELY RECYCLABLE aluminum.\"",
      "\"Let\u2019s make a positive change for the health of our planet. Let\u2019s clean up our oceans and our land. Join me on this journey. Let\u2019s make a switch to INFINITELY RECYCLABLE aluminum. Water in cans, NOT plastic,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Hunting Wives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is the definition of a binge watch. Sultry yet thought-provoking, the series has stayed near the top of the Netflix Top 10 charts since its debut on the streamer on July 21.",
      "Brittany Snow plays Sophie, who arrives in East Texas from Boston along with her husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit) and their son. She's a fish out of water, adjusting to new cultural norms and a few traumatic events in her past that cast a long shadow.",
      "The Maple Brook neighborhood clearly has a charged history. Luckily for Sophie, Margo (Malin Akerman) takes her under her wing \u2014 a good friend to have, considering Margo is married to a wealthy oil tycoon named Jed (Dermot Mulroney) who is running for governor.",
      "But there's a darkness lurking in this friend group. Local teenage Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, and anyone could be the killer. Signs are pointing to it being Sophie, since Abby was shot with Sophie\u2019s new gun. Yep, that\u2019s right: It only took a few weeks and Sophie was already getting arms to match her new neighbors\u2019.",
      "Sophie can hardly remember the night of Abby's murder \u2014 she and Margo were having a bit of a rager at Margo's lake house. But she's sure she's innocent. Still, she's not innocent when it comes to letting Margo convince her to start drinking, start driving after a tragic accident, and have affairs with younger men (and each other).",
      "Read on to find out what happens in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d and how the ending compares to the book by May Cobb.",
      "Who Kills Abby on 'The Hunting Wives'?",
      "Do you really want to know? OK: It's Margo, Sophie's new lover and the queen bee of the friend group.",
      "Two scenes from the first episode foreshadow Margo's crime.",
      "First, Abby hooks up with her then-boyfriend, high schooler Brad (George Ferrier), but stops because it conflicts with her faith. In the middle of all this, Margo opens the door and makes eye contact with Brad. Yep, they\u2019re a secret item.",
      "Aside from the age gap, and aside from the fact that Margo is married, there's another complication. Brad's mom Jill (Katie Lowes) is married to a prominent pastor and is Margo's friend.",
      "Second, there's the question of the tampons.",
      "Sophie meets Margo for the first time in the bathroom of her palatial house. There, Margo lets it slip that she can't use tampons. But that's not quite the case. In the finale, when Sophie and Margo have rekindled their romance, Sophie goes to the bathroom and sees tampons. Margo says she can use tampons.",
      "Why would this matter? Well, Pastor Pete (Paul Teal), the town's youth pastor (more on that dude later), had told Sophie that Abby had gotten an abortion \u2014 but he interpreted Brad's confession wrong. In fact, it was Margo who had the abortion. When's a time that women can't use tampons? After abortions.",
      "Margo had gone to her estranged biological dad, a doctor, to perform the procedure. (At the same time as all this, Margo is campaigning for her husband's anti-abortion stance).",
      "As for why Margo killed Abby? Her motive was simple. After a lifetime of manipulating her way to the top, Margo couldn't let her status be threatened, and Abby was about to do just that.",
      "Abby figured out that Margo had the abortion and was planning to reveal it \u2014 a disaster for Margo, her husband's campaign and her political career.",
      "Margo kills her. With the help of her father and brother Kyle (Michael Aaron Milligan), they conspire to help Margo cover it up, creating an alibi for her.",
      "Who Else Dies in  'The Hunting Wives'?",
      "A lot of people! Four, in fact. Here\u2019s who dies in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d aside from Abby.",
      "Abby's mom, Starr (Chrissy Metz), is killed by Jill, Brad's mom. Mess! Starr learns from Pastor Pete that her daughter had an abortion, which she didn't. She goes to confront Brad's mom, Jill \u2014 convinced that Jill had killed Abby. Seeing Starr with a rifle, Jill shoots her.Jill is then killed by Callie. Margo and Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), the sheriff's wife, go to Jill's house to confront her and find Starr's body. They're preparing to call the police. Jill pulls a gun out to stop them, then Callie kills her. Jill is framed as Abby's killer \u2014 until Sophie figures out the truth.Kyle is killed by Sophie in the show's final moments. Sophie confronts Margo about her findings \u2014 the tampon, the abortion, etc. Margo confesses to Jed about the abortion, affair with Brad and more. He kicks her out of their home and Margo goes to her brother Kyle's house. Kyle then goes after Sophie and tries to run her off the road. He gets out of his car to get her to talk. Sophie, instead, runs him over. She disposes of the body. This is her second vehicular homicide.

Michael\u2019s courage, his fortitude and his grace, more than anything else, is on full display,\u201d he told Variety. \u201cHe\u2019s very smart, very brave, noble, generous, passionate guy, and an example to all of us, whether we\u2019re facing Parkinson\u2019s or not. You cannot help but recognize how amazing it is to have such grace.\u201d",

      "\u201cSo he gives me both a physical representation of the disease to inform myself with, but more than that, he allows me to believe that Paul could believe that he could be adequate to the challenge,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that we can\u2019t be f------ around with this just to make a joke or anything. Parkinson\u2019s is not funny. And I want to get it right. It\u2019s necessary to be correct with what we do in respect of the challenge that Parkinson\u2019s represents, and that we don\u2019t use it for its entertainment value.\"",

Because it\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s what I love doing. I love telling stories. I love pretending to be somebody else.\u201d",
      "Ford, of course, has played everything from the president to Indiana Jones to police officers, but he soared to fame playing Han Solo in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. His character famously said, \u201cI know\u201d when Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia told him she loved him. He said that\u2019s not how the line was meant to go.",
      "\u201cI was supposed to say, \u2018I love you too,\u2019 and I thought that was a little un-Han Solo-ish,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was a little banal. So I said no, and (director) Irvin Kershner agreed with me. George (Lucas), when he saw it, was not so sure, and made me sit next to him at the screening of the film the first time we ran it for an audience. They laughed, but it was a good laugh, so we kept it in. Thank you, George.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee will travel to the Gaza Strip on Friday, the White House announced, a significant move as Israel continues facing mounting international pressure to allow increased aid into the enclave.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, special envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee will be traveling into Gaza to inspect the current distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food and meet with local Gazans to hear firsthand about this dire situation on the ground,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Thursday\u2019s press briefing.",
      "The trip comes as an increased number of people in Gaza are dying from malnutrition, prompting more nations to call for Israel to address the humanitarian situation. Leavitt said that the U.S. officials would work toward a plan for additional food and aid distribution.",
      "\u201cThe special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region, and we will provide more details for all of you once that plan is approved and agreed on by the president of the United States,\u201d she said during the briefing.",
      "Witkoff traveled to Israel overnight and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday to address the humanitarian situation. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that Israel \u201chas a lot of responsibility for flow of aid,\u201d emphasizing that its government could greatly expand access to food.",
      "Israel announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d in military operations in Gaza on Sunday, stepping up efforts to provide humanitarian aid to civilians. Netanyahu said Monday that his government would work with international agencies, as well as with the U.S. and European nations, to ensure large amounts of aid enter the Gaza Strip.",
      "In recent days, Trump has weighed in on the hunger crisis, saying, \u201cWe have to get the kids fed.\u201d He said there was \u201creal starvation\u201d in Gaza, comments that were echoed by Vice President JD Vance, who said the administration was \u201cvery worried about the humanitarian problem in Gaza.\u201d",
      "The president also said this week that the U.S., alongside international partners, would help fund and set up food centers in Gaza.",
      "Many Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have also voiced concern about the situation and are pushing the Trump administration to help broker a ceasefire agreement. Witkoff pulled the U.S. negotiating team out of Doha, Qatar, last week after he said Hamas showed \u201ca lack of desire\u201d to reach a deal.",
      "More than 120 people in Gaza have died from malnutrition since the start of the war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification said in recent days that \u201cthe worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip.\u201d",
      "A growing number of countries are increasingly condemning the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and the United Kingdom, France and Canada said they plan to recognize a Palestinian state this fall. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s office said it would recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel \u201ctakes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president expressed his displeasure and his disagreement with the leaders of France, the United Kingdom and Canada,\u201d Leavitt said during the briefing. \u201cHe feels as though that\u2019s rewarding Hamas at a time where Hamas is the true impediment to a ceasefire and to the release of all of the hostages.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The magnitude-8.8 earthquake off Russia\u2019s Kamchatka peninsula sent a wave of water racing at the speed of a jetliner toward Hawaii, California and Washington state, spurring warnings and alarm overnight Wednesday.",
      "But when the tsunami waves arrived, they didn\u2019t cause devastation or deaths in the United States, and the inundation might not have appeared threatening in some locations where warnings were issued.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean the tsunami was a \"bust,\" that it was poorly forecast or that it didn\u2019t pose a risk, earthquake and tsunami researchers said.",
      "\u201cYou start to hear \u2018tsunami warning,\u2019 and everyone immediately thinks of the last Hollywood movie they saw, and then it comes in at 3 feet and people are like, 'What\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should count it as a win that a tsunami occurred, we got a warning and it wasn\u2019t the worst-case scenario.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "How strong was the Kamchatka earthquake? And why did it change so much?",
      "Initial reports from the U.S. Geological Survey pegged the Kamchatka earthquake at magnitude 8.0. Later, it was upgraded to 8.8.",
      "\u201cThat is not uncommon for very, very large earthquakes in those initial minutes,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cOur standard algorithms for determining the size of an earthquake quickly saturate. It\u2019s like turning up an amp and getting a lot of distortion.\"",
      "One of the first signs the earthquake was stronger than the initial seismic reports said was an initial measurement from a buoy about 275 miles southeast of the Kamchatka peninsula.",
      "The buoy, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) system, is connected to a seafloor pressure sensor about 4 miles below the surface.",
      "The sensor registered a 90-centimeter wave \u2014 more than 35 inches \u2014 which is eye-popping to tsunami researchers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the second-largest recording we ever saw in the tsunami world,\u201d said Vasily Titov, a senior tsunami modeler at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, adding that it indicated there was \u201ca catastrophic tsunami propagating in the ocean.\u201d",
      "Titov said the only higher reading was from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people in Japan.",
      "Seismic models later confirmed that Wednesday's earthquake was magnitude 8.8, which means it released nearly 16 times as much energy as a magnitude-8.0 earthquake, according to a USGS calculation tool.",
      "T\u014dhoku was much bigger.",
      "Tobin estimated that earthquake released two to three times as much energy as was observed in Kamchatka. Titov said the tsunami in Japan was also about three times larger.",
      "In addition, he said the T\u014dhoku earthquake \u201cproduced an anomalously large seafloor displacement,\u201d lurching and moving more water than expected, even for an earthquake of its magnitude.",
      "At Kamchatka, \u201cit\u2019s likely that there was less seafloor displacement than could have happened in a worst-case or more dire scenario for a magnitude-8.8,\u201d Tobin said, though more research will be needed to confirm that theory.",
      "How did researchers make a forecast? How good was the forecast?",
      "In two hours, researchers produced a tsunami forecast for \u201cpretty much the whole Pacific and for warning points along the U.S. coastlines,\u201d Titov said, with predictions of water levels at coastal tide gauges and for flood inundation.",
      "The tsunami took about eight hours to reach Hawaii and 12 hours to reach the California coast.",
      "Titov, who helped build the models used by forecasters who issue warnings from the National Tsunami Warning Centers in Hawaii and Alaska, said the models rely on seismic data and the network of more than 70 DART buoys along the Pacific Rim, which sense pressure changes. The United States owns and operates more than half of the DART buoys.",
      "Titov said the models indicated that north shore areas of Hawaii would get tsunami waves of about 2 meters or less.",
      "\u201cHilo was predicted at about 2 meters [6.5 feet], and it materialized at about 150 centimeters,\u201d or 1.5 meters (5 feet), Titov said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly how we want it \u2014 a little bit on the conservative side.\u201d",
      "The same trend played out in parts of California, Titov said.",
      "It will take some time to assess how well the models predicted inundation because reports about the extent of flooding are still coming in.",
      "\u201cWe know that the flooding occurred at Hawaii. We don\u2019t know exactly the extent, but from the reports that I saw on TV, it looks like exactly what we predicted,\u201d Titov said.",
      "Why were people in Hawaii evacuated for a 5-foot wave?",
      "Yong Wei, a tsunami modeler and senior research scientist at the University of Washington and the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, said a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tsunami wave can be very dangerous, particularly in shallow waters off Hawaii.",
      "Tsunami waves contain far more energy than wind waves, which are far shorter in wavelength and period (time between waves) and slower in speed.",
      "Wei said tsunami waves of the size that struck Hawaii can surge inland \u201ctens of meters,\u201d produce dangerous currents and damage boats and other moveable objects.",
      "\u201cPeople die. If they stay there and they don\u2019t get any warning, 2 meters can definitely kill people,\u201d Wei said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the beach, strong currents can definitely pull you out into the ocean and people will get drowned.\u201d",
      "Tobin said the initial warnings were conservative but appropriate, in his view.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think, oh, we had a warning and nothing much happened and pooh-pooh it \u2014 'I can ignore it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWarnings by nature have to err a bit on the side of caution.\u201d",
      "Was this a historic event?",
      "No. The Kamchatka peninsula has a long history of earthquakes.",
      "\u201cThis was an area that was ready for another earthquake, and there had been a lot of earthquakes in that region over the last few weeks,\u201d which indicates increased risk, said Breanyn MacInnes, a professor in the geological sciences department at Central Washington University.",
      "In 1952, before scientists had a strong understanding of plate tectonics, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kamchatka peninsula in much the same region, sending a tsunami into the town of Severo-Kurilsk.",
      "\u201cPeople in Russia were not really prepared for it. It was very big earthquake, a big tsunami, and they were caught off guard,\u201d MacInnes said.",
      "MacInnes said the tsunami was 30 to 60 feet in height in southern parts of the peninsula.",
      "\u201cThousands of people were killed, and basically the town was destroyed,\u201d said Joanne Bourgeois, an emeritus professor of sedimentology at the University of Washington, who has been studying the region\u2019s earthquake history for about three decades.",
      "How would the tsunami warning system perform if the earthquake struck closer to home?",
      "The Kamchatka tsunami is a megathrust earthquake produced along a large subduction zone fault, when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The U.S. West Coast features a similar fault, called the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs offshore from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a mirror image across the Pacific,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cAn 8.8 at a relatively shallow depth in Cascadia is definitely in the realm of scenarios. We could have a similar event here.\u201d",
      "In fact, Cascadia has the potential to produce much larger quakes, Tobin said. Modeling suggests Cascadia could produce tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet.",
      "Subduction zone earthquakes typically produce tsunamis that reach shore in about 30 minutes to an hour, Titov said, which would strain forecasters\u2019 capabilities to predict tsunami effects precisely along the U.S. West Coast before inundation happened.",
      "Titov said more seafloor sensors, more computer processing and innovation with artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to speed forecasting.",
      "Tobin said the successful tsunami warning Tuesday should spur investment in seafloor sensors and seismic monitoring stations offshore along the subduction zone.",
      "\u201cThis shows the value and importance of NOAA and the USGS in these times where some of these government agencies have come into question,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had a tsunami warning if it weren\u2019t for NOAA, and the next one could be a closer event. They showed their value.\u201d"

      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",

The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",

      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",

      "North Korea said Tuesday that while the relationship between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and President Donald Trump is \u201cnot bad,\u201d the United States must accept the isolated country as a nuclear weapons state.",
      "Dismissing the idea of further talks on denuclearization, Kim\u2019s powerful sister said that reality has changed since Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "\u201cThe year 2025 is neither 2018 nor 2019,\u201d Kim Yo Jong, who is believed to speak for her brother, said in a statement carried by the North Korean state news agency KCNA.",
      "\u201cThe recognition of the irreversible position of the DPRK as a nuclear weapons state and the hard fact that its capabilities and geopolitical environment have radically changed should be a prerequisite for predicting and thinking everything in the future,\u201d she said, using the abbreviation for North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "While Kim acknowledged that the \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d between Trump and her brother is \u201cnot bad,\u201d she said using it to pursue North Korea\u2019s denuclearization would be seen as \u201cmockery.\u201d",

      "Trump, who has often talked about his \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with the North Korean leader, has met with him in person three times and has expressed openness to the resumption of diplomacy.",
      "Though Trump and Kim signed an agreement in principle about denuclearization at their Singapore summit in 2018, talks broke down the next year after the United States refused to grant North Korea sanctions relief.",
      "North Korea has since advanced its nuclear and ballistic missile programs through weapons testing and a security partnership with Russia \u2014 changes alluded to by Kim Yo Jong.",
      "The State Department said last month that the Trump administration remained committed to achieving the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of North Korea.",
      "The White House did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment overnight. A White House official told Reuters that denuclearization remained the goal.",
      "The office of South Korea\u2019s new president, Lee Jae-myung, said Tuesday that South Korea supports the idea of renewed U.S.-North Korea talks.",
      "South Korea and the United States \u201cwill continue to engage in close communication and cooperation on overall North Korea policy, including the potential resumption of U.S.-North Korea dialogue,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "Kim\u2019s statement was her second in as many days, after she rejected efforts at outreach by Lee, who is seen as more open to repairing relations with the North than his conservative predecessor.",
      "\u201cNo matter what policy is adopted and whatever proposal is made in Seoul, we have no interest in it and there is neither the reason to meet nor the issue to be discussed,\u201d she said in the statement Monday.",
      "She also criticized South Korea\u2019s \u201cblind trust\u201d in its longtime U.S. alliance and upcoming joint military exercises that North Korea sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who is in charge of handling relations with the North, said Monday that he would recommend reducing or suspending the U.S.-South Korea drills to promote engagement with Pyongyang.",
      "The rare twin statements from Kim Yo Jong reflect \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s intent to take an initiative in leading the conversation on the Korean Peninsula issue, whether through dialogue or confrontation,\u201d Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said in an interview.",
      "The message to South Korea used relatively moderate language, Yang said, while the U.S. message implied the potential for talks on nuclear arms reduction rather than denuclearization, suggesting North Korea is trying to gauge the response from both countries.",
      "The fact that Kim acknowledged the relationship between Trump and her brother \u201csuggests both a desire to prevent further deterioration of the situation and a possible signal for another summit,\u201d Yang said."

      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe was convicted of witness tampering and bribery charges on Monday, in a historic trial that gripped the South American nation and threatened to tarnish the conservative strongman\u2019s legacy.",
      "The ruling was announced by a judge in Bogota, the country\u2019s capital, following a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law and order leader of having links to a paramilitary group founded by ranchers in the 1990s.",
      "In a lengthy ruling that lasted more than ten hours, Judge Sandra Heredia said there was enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer, to coax three former members of paramilitary groups who were in prison into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a left-wing senator who had launched a probe into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "The case dates back to 2012, when Uribe filed a libel suit against Cepeda, with the Supreme Court. But in a surprise twist the high court dismissed charges against Cepeda and launched an investigation against Uribe in 2018.",
      "Uribe faces up to 12 years in prison for the crimes he has been charged with. A sentencing will be delivered in a separate hearing. The former president is expected to appeal the ruling in a high court."

      "White House officials said Trump had previously approved $60 million for aid to Gaza but that it had gotten little public notice and that the promise of more food \u2014 and a better system to ensure that it gets to civilians \u2014 points to ongoing need.",
      "\"He has continued to see photos of starving children and wants to continue to help,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News. In 2017, pictures of victims of chemical weapons attacks prompted Trump to launch Tomahawk missiles over Syria."
