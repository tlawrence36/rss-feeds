      "Conservationists and a Native American advocacy group are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "Eds: This story has been corrected to show the Western Shoshone Defense Project is a Native American advocacy group, not a recognized tribe."

      "North Carolina elections officials say that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.",
      "Early in-person voting, which ended Saturday, has become increasingly popular in the presidential battleground state over several election cycles. People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.",
      "Four years ago, a record 3.63 million people voted at hundreds of sites in all 100 counties during the early-voting period. This year, the state exceeded that total by Thursday, days before the period ended, the board said.",
      "Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters \u2014 or 57% of the state\u2019s 7.8 million registered voters \u2014 cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.",
      "Turnout in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene was stronger than the rest of the state at 58.9% \u2014 about 2% higher than statewide turnout, officials said.",
      "\u201cI am proud of all of our 100 county boards of elections and the thousands of election workers who are making this happen in their communities,\u201d state board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement. \u201cAnd I am especially proud of the workers and voters of Western North Carolina. You are an inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s strong early turnout has come partly in response to a push by state and national Republicans to get people to vote early. Their message marks a sharp contrast to the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump \u2014 without any evidence to back the claim \u2014 said mail-in voting was rife with fraud.",
      "In addition to president, North Carolina residents are choosing a new governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions, along with members of the U.S. House and state General Assembly."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:34:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Florida&rsquo;s election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, as Democrats count on turnout for abortion rights and recreational marijuana ballot questions",
    "story": [
      "Florida\u2019s election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, as Democrats count on turnout for abortion rights and recreational marijuana ballot questions",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida's election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, or whether Democrats make some gains by tapping into the support for abortion and marijuana ballot questions and the new energy Vice President Kamala Harris brings to the race.",
      "Gone are the days when Florida was looked at as the biggest prize among swing states. After former President Barack Obama won Florida twice, former President Donald Trump carried the state by a whisker in 2016 and then by a much larger share in 2020. In 2022, Republicans took all five statewide seats on the ballot by landslide margins.",
      "Still, there is a lot of buzz over constitutional amendments that could protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, with both sides of each issue pumping millions of dollars into advertising. Democrats support the ballot measures and hope they boost turnout to give them at least a chance stopping Trump's third straight Florida victory and keeping U.S. Sen. Rick Scott from winning a second term.",
      "The only statewide office on the ballot is Scott\u2019s Senate seat. Scott is being challenged by former Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcarsel-Powell in a race that\u2019s been overshadowed by the presidential election and the abortion and marijuana ballot questions.",
      "Even if Trump and Scott are victorious in Florida, Democratic Party Chairwoman Nikki Fried said the election will be a huge success if the amendments pass and the party flips enough legislative seats to take away the Republicans' supermajority.",
      "\u201cLook where we were in of November 2022. We had the largest loss that Florida Democrats have ever experienced,\u201d Fried said. \u201cNobody anticipated that we would even have this conversation today, that the polls are showing that we are tight, that there was even a possibility that Florida would be in play. Everybody counted us out.\u201d",
      "Still, it's an uphill climb. The amendments need support from at least 60% of voters, and there's enough money being spent against them that it could create doubts among voters who normally support the issues, said Florida-based Republican political strategist Jamie Miller.",
      "\u201cAs a general rule, amendments pass if there\u2019s no real effort against them and they fail when there are real efforts against them,\" Miller said.",
      "Miller also believes Democrats are motivated to vote against the Republicans they don't like rather than be inspired by their own candidates.",
      "\u201cI see excitement against Donald Trump and against Rick Scott, but that as a general rule in the state the size of Florida is not enough to get you across the line,\u201d he said.",
      "Scott served two terms as governor, winning each with less than 50% of the vote. In 2018, he defeated incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a race decided by 0.2 percentage points. But Florida politics changed. The last time Scott was on the ballot, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the state. Republicans now have a million-voter advantage.",
      "Scott, one of the richest members of Congress, pumped millions of dollars of his own money into the race, as he has with his previous three elections. Far outspent, and with little money coming in from national Democrats until the last few weeks of the race, Murcarsel-Powell struggled to gain attention.",
      "While Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn't on the ballot, he spent time campaigning against the abortion rights and marijuana amendments. DeSantis even used state agencies to fight the amendment, with the Agency for Health Care Administration set up a website and aired TV ads providing information on abortion and the Department of Health tried to stop television stations from airing a pro-amendment ad.",
      "The abortion amendment would protect the rights of women to have an abortion up to the point the fetus can survive outside the womb. Florida now bans abortion six weeks after conception, when many women don't realize they are pregnant.",
      "Voters overwhelming approved medical marijuana in 2016. This year they're being asked to legalize recreational marijuana. The marijuana industry has spent tens of millions of dollars on the campaign, while DeSantis has raised money against it and criticized it often during official events.",
      "Very few, if any, of Florida's 28 congressional seats are competitive, but the state will elect at least one new member to Congress. Former Senate President Mike Haridopolos is favored to replace retiring Republican Rep. Bill Posey. He's being challenged by Democrat Sandy Kennedy in a strong Republican district.",
      "Republicans will maintain firm control of the Legislature. Democrats will consider it a major victory if they flip enough seats to remove the supermajority GOP hold in the House and Senate.",
      "One of the legislative seats being heavily targeted is held by Republican Sen. Corey Simon, a former Florida State and NFL football star who is being challenged by nationally known civil rights lawyer Daryl Parks, who is the former partner of civil rights lawyer Ben Crump."

      "DELPHI, Ind. -- The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings.",
      "Prosecutors rested their case Thursday against Richard Allen after jurors heard recorded phone calls in which he told his wife that he killed Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen's trial began Oct. 18 at the Carroll County Courthouse in Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown. Jurors have been sequestered since the begining of the trial, which is scheduled to run through Nov. 15.",
      "The defense began calling its first witnesses Thursday. A psychologist for the Indiana Department of Correction told jurors Friday that Allen was seriously mentally ill when he began confessing to the killings while housed at the Westville Correctional Facility.",
      "Allen, 52, faces up to 130 years in prison if he is convicted on two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.",
      "Here are some key moments in the trial so far:",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland opened the trial by telling jurors they would see and hear evidence, including incriminating statements Allen has made, that will convince them he forced the girls off a hiking trail into a secluded area while armed with a gun and cut their throats.",
      "Allen was the person seen on cellphone video German recorded on the day the girls disappeared and an unspent bullet found between their bodies came from Allen's gun, McLeland said.",
      "Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin told jurors Allen is innocent. Baldwin said the jury would hear witness statements and forensic evidence that would raise \u201creasonable doubt\u201d that Allen is not the killer and said the state's timeline does not match the evidence in the case.",
      "Someone else may have kidnapped the teens and returned them early the next day to the scene where they were found dead, Baldwin said.",
      "In the first full week of the trial, jurors were shown photographs of the area where the teens' bodies were found in a wooded area off the hiking trail. The girls, known as Abby and Libby, had crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge during their hike.",
      "Some jurors and others in the courtroom gasped or turned away when gruesome images of their bloody bodies were shown, and the girls' mothers wept.",
      "Jurors also viewed cellphone video that German recorded just before the youths vanished showing a man wearing a blue jacket and jeans following Williams as she crosses the Monon High Bridge.",
      "In an enhanced version of the video shown to jurors, one of the girls says, \u201cThere\u2019s no path so we have to go down here.\u201d Just before the video ends, prosecutors said, the man seen in the video tells the teens, \u201c Down the hill.\u201d",
      "Investigators said in an affidavit released about a month after Allen's October 2022 arrest that he became a suspect after they went back and reviewed \u201cprior tips\u201d and found that he had been interviewed by an officer in 2017.",
      "Trial testimony has revealed more details about how they zeroed in on the former pharmacy worker.",
      "A retired state government worker who volunteered in March 2017 to help police with the investigation told jurors that in September 2022 she found paperwork that caught her eye.",
      "Kathy Shank testified she found a \u201clead sheet\u201d saying that two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found, a man contacted authorities and said he had been on the trail the afternoon the girls went missing. His name was listed incorrectly as Richard Allen Whiteman and marked \u201ccleared,\u201d Shank said.",
      "She determined the man\u2019s name was actually Richard Allen and recalled that a young girl had been on the trail at the same location and time and had seen a man.",
      "\u201cI thought there could be a correlation,\u201d Shank testified, adding that she notified officers of her find.",
      "The girls' bodies were found Feb. 14, 2017, the day after they went missing.",
      "Two days later, Allen contacted authorities and told them he was on the hiking trail the afternoon of Feb. 13, during the time period when the girls disappeared, according to testimony.",
      "Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain, told the court he spoke to Allen, who said he was on the hiking trail between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and remembered seeing three girls.",
      "After Shank brought Allen to investigators\u2019 attention, they interviewed him in October 2022. Allen told investigators he arrived at the trail around noon and left no later than 2 p.m., not 3:30 p.m. as he told Dulin in 2017.",
      "Steve Mullin, who was Delphi's police chief when the girls were killed and later became an investigator at the county prosecutor\u2019s office, said Allen told him and another officer that he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie on the day the teens vanished.",
      "Mullin said he asked Allen if he was the similarly dressed person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "\u201cHis response was if the picture was taken with the girls\u2019 camera, there was no way it was him,\u201d Mullin testified.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors police interviews with Allen videotaped before his arrest in which he repeatedly professed his innocence.",
      "On Thursday the jury heard several recorded phone calls of Allen speaking with his wife from prison in which he told her that he killed German and Williams. In one of the calls, he said, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "The jury heard testimony earlier from the former warden of the Westville Correctional Facility, where Allen was previously held, who said Allen claimed to have killed the girls with a box cutter that he later discarded.",
      "Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s prison psychologist during his time at Westville, testified Allen began confessing to killing the girls in early 2023 during his sessions with her. She said he provided details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies.",
      "A report written by Wala and presented to the jury as an exhibit states Allen also told her he had planned to rape the teens but did not do so after he saw a van traveling nearby.",
      "A state trooper testified Thursday that Allen's remark corroborated a statement by a man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge and who said he was driving home in his van around that time.",
      "Allen's attorneys have said their client made the incriminating statements while under the pressure and mental stress of being locked up and watched 24 hours a day and being taunted by people incarcerated with him.",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged she followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while she was treating him and that she was a fan of the true crime genre.",
      "Court documents released weeks after Allen\u2019s arrest state that testing determined an unspent bullet found between the girls' bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d a pistol Allen owned.",
      "Melissa Oberg, an Indiana State Police firearms expert, told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s Sig Sauer, a .40-caliber handgun.",
      "Allen\u2019s attorney tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of firearms testing during cross-examination. Oberg said she is not aware of making any identification mistakes in her more than 17 years of analyzing firearms."

      "BOSTON -- Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes.",
      "Hundreds of acres (hectares) in the greater Boston area have already burned in the past week with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state.",
      "In Massachusetts, an average of 15 wildland fires are reported each October. This year, the month\u2019s total capped at about 200 \u2014 an increase of about 1,200% over the average, rivalling the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.",
      "About 100 fire were reported over the last seven days of the month and preliminary information indicates that all of them started with human activity, according to fire officials. The fires prompted some communities last week to cancel school classes and Halloween activities.",
      "On Friday, the National Weather Service declared a \u201cred flag\u201d warning for much of eastern Massachusetts. The warning means that the region, which has been experiencing dry and warm weather, is at high risk of fire.",
      "Fire officials have reminded residents that open burning is prohibited statewide through January and in many communities year-round.",
      "They also urged residents to avoid outdoor cooking and heating and to use caution when using power equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The engines can become hot enough to ignite dry leaves and grass.",
      "Fire officials also cautioned against tossing cigarette butts, matches, or other smoking materials over the edge of a balcony, stub them out on stairs or railings, or toss them in dry vegetation or debris.",
      "On Saturday, a Boston man was arrested in connection to a brush fire in Milford, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. The man was charged with setting fire to another\u2019s land and burning land, trees, lumber and produce.",
      "More than a quarter of this year's brush and wildland fires took place in October, according to Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The October fires have also accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres (469 hectares) burned so far this year.",
      "\u201cThe weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead,\" Celino said in a press release. \"Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.\u201d",
      "State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said about 45% of Massachusetts homes are in or near wooded areas at risk for brush and wildland fires. Many of those fires have started with activity around the house, like outdoor cooking and using lawn tractors and other power equipment, he added.",

      "U.N. experts say Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council.",
      "To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area.",
      "Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately.",
      "Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe group\u2019s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,\u201d the U.N. experts said. \u201cSuch a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.\u201d",
      "In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2.",
      "The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia.",
      "The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",
      "The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, \u201chas now escalated into a major international crisis.\u201d",
      "According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015.",
      "\u201cThe panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,\u201d the report said.",
      "The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians.",
      "Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn\u2019t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said.",
      "\u201cThe scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,\u201d the experts said.",
      "The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.",
      "It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives \u201caimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.\u201d",
      "Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. \u201cThe internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,\u201d it said.",
      "The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said.",
      "\u201cExploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,\u201d they said. \u201cRecruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.\u201d",
      "Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen\u2019s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat \u2014 and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks."

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:50:21 -0500",
    "summary": "No one knows how Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- In 1989, Americans were riveted by the shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion by their own children. Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison and lost all subsequent appeals. But today, more than three decades later, they unexpectedly have a chance of getting out.",
      "Not because of the workings of the legal system. Because of entertainment.",
      "After two recent documentaries and a scripted drama on the pair brought new attention to the 35-year-old case, the Los Angeles district attorney has recommended they be resentenced.",
      "The popularity and proliferation of true crime entertainment like Netflix\u2019s docudrama \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u201d is effecting real life changes for their subjects and in society more broadly. At their best, true crime podcasts, streaming series and social media content can help expose injustices and right wrongs.",
      "But because many of these products prioritize entertainment and profit, they also can have serious negative consequences.",
      "The use of true crime stories to sell a product has a long history in America, from the tabloid \u201cpenny press\u201d papers of the mid-1800s to television movies like 1984's \u201cThe Burning Bed.\" These days it's podcasts, bingeable Netflix series and even true crime TikToks. The fascination with the genre may be considered morbid by some, but it can be partially explained by the human desire to make sense of the world through stories.",
      "In the case of the Menendez brothers, Lyle, who was then 21, and Erik, then 18, have said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father\u2019s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. But at their trial, many of the sex abuse allegations were not allowed to be presented to the jury, and prosecutors contended they committed murder simply to get at their parents\u2019 money.",
      "For years, that's the story that many people who watched the saga from a distance accepted and talked about.",
      "The new dramas delve into the brothers' childhood, helping the public better understand the context of the crime and thus see the world as a less frightening place, says Adam Banner, a criminal defense attorney who writes a column on pop culture and the law for the American Bar Association\u2019s ABA Journal.",
      "\u201cNot only does that make us feel better intrinsically,\" Banner says, \u201cbut it also objectively gives us the ability to think, \u2018Well, now I can take this case and put it in a different bucket than another situation where I have no explanation and the only thing I can say is, \u2018This child just must be evil.'\u201d",
      "Much true crime of the past takes particularly shocking crimes and explores them in depth, generally with the assumption that those convicted of the crime were actually guilty and deserved to be punished.",
      "The success of the podcast \u201c Serial,\u201d which cast doubt on the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, has given birth to a newer genre that often assumes (and intends to prove) the opposite. The protagonists are innocent, or \u2014 as in the case of the Menendez brothers \u2014 guilty but sympathetic, and thus not deserving of their harsh sentences.",
      "\u201cThere is an old tradition of journalists picking apart criminal cases and showing that people are potentially innocent,\u201d says Maurice Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project and author of \u201cLet the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think that the curve kind of goes up exponentially in the wake of \u2018Serial,\u2019 which was 2014 and obviously changed the entire landscape economically and culturally of podcasts,\" Chammah says. \"And then you have \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 come along a few years later and become a kind of behemoth example of that in docuseries.\u201d",
      "Roughly during the same time period, the innocence movement gained traction along with the Black Lives Matter movement and greater attention on police custody deaths. And in popular culture, both fiction and nonfiction, the trend is to mine a villainous character's backstory.",
      "\u201cAll these superheroes, supervillains, the movie \u2018Joker' \u2014 you\u2019re just inundated with this idea that people\u2019s bad behavior is shaped by trauma when they were younger,\u201d Chammah said.",
      "Banner often represents some of the least sympathetic defendants imaginable, including those accused of child sexual abuse. He says the effects of these cultural trends are real. Juries today are more likely to give his clients the benefit of the doubt and are more skeptical of police and prosecutors. But he also worries about the intense focus in current true crime on cases where things went wrong, which he says are the outliers.",
      "While the puzzle aspect of \u201cDid they get it right?\u201d might feed our curiosity, he says, we run the risk of sowing distrust in the entire criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away the positive ramifications that putting that spotlight on a case can bring. But you also don\u2019t want to give off the impression that this is how our justice system works. That if we can get enough cameras and microphones on a case, then that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to save somebody off of death row or that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get a life sentence overturned.\u201d",
      "Adds Chammah: \"If you open up sentencing decisions and second looks and criminal justice policy to pop culture \u2014 in the sense of who gets a podcast made about them, who gets Kim Kardashian talking about them \u2014 the risk of extreme arbitrariness is really great. ... It feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the wealthy family of some defendant basically funds a podcast that tries to make a viral case for their innocence.\u201d",
      "Whitney Phillips, who teaches a class on true crime and media ethics at the University of Oregon, says the popularity of the genre on social media adds another layer of complications, often encouraging active participation of viewer and listeners.",
      "\u201cBecause these are not trained detectives or people who have any actual subject area expertise in forensics or even criminal law, then there\u2019s this really common outcome of the wrong people being implicated or floated as suspects,\" she says. \"Also, the victims' families now are part of the discourse. They might be accused of this, that, or the other, or at the very least, you have your loved one's murder, violent death, being entertainment for millions of strangers.\u201d",
      "This sensibility has been both chronicled and lampooned in the streaming comedy-drama series \u201cOnly Murders in the Building,\u201d which follows three unlikely collaborators who live in a New York apartment building where a murder has taken place. The trio decide to make a true crime podcast while simultaneously trying to solve the case.",
      "Nothing about true crime is fundamentally unethical, Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s that the social media system \u2014 the attention economy \u2014 is not calibrated for ethics. It\u2019s calibrated for views, it\u2019s calibrated for engagement and it\u2019s calibrated for sensationalism.\"",
      "Many influencers are now vying for the \u201cmurder audience,\u201d Phillips says, with social media and more traditional media feeding off each other. True crime is now creeping into lifestyle content and even makeup tutorials.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of inevitable that you would see the collision of these two things and having these influencers literally just put on a face of makeup and then tell a very kind of \u2014 it\u2019s very informal, it\u2019s very dishy, it\u2019s often not particularly well researched,\" she says. \u201cThis is not investigative journalism.\u201d"

      "It was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies. He suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn\u2019t be willing to support foreign wars if she had \u201cnine barrels shooting at her.\u201d",
      "Facing criticism for suggesting violence against the media, Trump's campaign later played down his comments.",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. Instead he claimed that Trump was suggesting that reporters were in \u201cgreat danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!\u201d",
      "Trump also revived falsehoods about elections and argued that he can only lose to Democrat Kamala Harris if he is cheated, even though polls suggest a very tight race.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a crooked country,\" Trump railed to his crowd on a chilly airport tarmac, returning to the grievance that had defined the early days of his campaign. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to put you in jail because you want to make it straight. Think of it, think of it. They cheat in elections and you call them on it and they want to put you in jail.\u201d",
      "Trump was indicted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in both Washington and Georgia.",
      "Some of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged Trump to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday night after polls close even if the race is too early to call. That's what Trump did four years ago, kicking off months of denial and lies that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "For much of this year, Trump had run a relatively disciplined campaign, emphasizing the issues his aides believe can deliver him victory, even as he clung to false theories about voter fraud and frequently went on digressions, stirring controversy. But that discipline is increasingly collapsing.",
      "Trump in recent weeks has joked about golfer Arnold Palmer's genitalia, continued using gendered or sexist language in his efforts to win over women and staged a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden with speakers who made crude and racist insults that continue to dominate the headlines.",
      "The darker and more profane tone of his campaign has comes as the former president, who has long been a fan of the masculine pageantry of the WWE, has been entering his rallies to the ominous tolling bell music once used by the wrestler known as \u201cThe Undertaker.\"",
      "Trump had nonetheless been delivering what was a fairly consistent stump speech most days, aided by a series of videos that kept him on script, even as he veered from subject to subject in a discursive style he has labeled \u201cthe weave.\u201d But outside the Lancaster airport, he completely abandoned his planned remarks, skipping his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.",
      "Trump's remarks in Pennsylvania were not planned according to a person familiar with them, who noted Trump is known to ad-lib. While it was unclear exactly what had set Trump off, his campaign had released a memo earlier in the day criticizing new polling from The New York Times again showing the race extremely close in the seven major swing states.",
      "Trump had spoken by phone before he took the stage with two reporters who had mentioned polling, including one who had asked him if he thought there was any way he could lose.",
      "Trump has been frustrated that the campaign remains locked in a close fight to the finish. He thinks Harris is an unworthy opponent and he cannot understand why he isn't dominating, said one Republican familiar with the dynamics of the campaign who, like others, was granted anonymity to discuss it.",
      "Another Republican blamed last-minute anxiety -- and Trump having to trust a system that he believes is rigged against him.",
      "Still, several Trump allies applauded his speech, saying that they were glad he was shining a light on concerns about fraud in the race's final stretch.",
      "Harris pushed back at Trump's characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters on Sunday that Trump's comments are \u201cmeant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.\u201d Those \u201cgood systems\u201d were in place in 2020, Harris said, and \u201che lost.\u201d",
      "The vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, \u201cin particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won't matter.\u201d",
      "Trump, for his part, acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach with his conspiratorial speech. He repeatedly talked about disregarding the advice of his aides, repeating their feedback in a mocking voice and insisting that he had to talk about election fraud despite their objections.",
      "In his next appearance a few hours later at an airport in Kinston, North Carolina, Trump returned to much of his usual script, alternating between prepared remarks and familiar stories.",
      "At one point, he said, \u201chopefully, we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,\u201d undercutting the Senate Republican leader who endorsed Trump earlier this year despite blaming him for the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cCan you believe he endorsed me?\u201d Trump added a minute later with a laugh. \u201cThat must have been a painful day in his life.\u201d",
      "He took the stage a third time Sunday night in Macon, Georgia, sticking more closely to his prepared remarks and focusing heavily on immigration.",
      "Trump told his supporters that in two days, they were going to \u201csave our country\" and that they were \u201con the verge of the four greatest years in American history.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou watch. It\u2019s going to be so good. It\u2019s going to be so much fun. It\u2019ll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be something.\u201d",

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has ruled that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting rights of people who\u2019ve recently become U.S. citizens.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized citizens. The four were on the state\u2019s list of questionable registrations to be challenged by local elections officials.",
      "The state\u2019s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names from the list would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House.",
      "In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S. citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court's recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to \u201cact with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Locher also said the state's effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots.",
      "In a statement on Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, celebrated the ruling.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for election integrity,\" Reynolds said. \"In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the law and ensure those votes aren\u2019t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a non-citizen.\u201d",
      "Rita Bettis Austen, legal director for the ACLU of Iowa, said some voters could be disenfranchised due to the ruling and Secretary of State Paul Pate's directive.",
      "\u201cWe are obviously disappointed with the court\u2019s decision not to outright block Secretary Pate\u2019s directive, which we still fear threatens to disenfranchise eligible voters simply because they are people who became citizens in the past several years,\" Austen said in a written statement. \u201cEven the Secretary agrees that the vast majority of voters on his list are United States citizens.\u201d",
      "Even still, Austen said the lawsuit forced Pate to back away from forcing everyone on the list to vote provisionally only. County auditors may permit a voter on the list to cast a regular ballot if they deem it appropriate, and voters can prove they are citizens with documentation, she added.",
      "After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit Friday, Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote, but the Biden administration wouldn\u2019t provide data about them.",
      "Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when they previously sought driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "\"Today\u2019s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,\u201d Bird said in the statement issued after Sunday's decision.",
      "But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn\u2019t have been included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens\u2019 voting rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating them if they cast ballots.",
      "Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a move so close to Election Day.",
      "The people on the state\u2019s list of potential noncitizens may have become naturalized citizens after their statements to the Department of Transportation. Pate\u2019s office told county elections officials to challenge their ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their U.S. citizenship.",
      "In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate's attorney said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have proven citizenship at a polling place.",
      "Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to vote, and the first question on Iowa\u2019s voter registration form asks whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.",
      "Locher\u2019s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S. Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.",
      "In Iowa\u2019s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a tiny fraction of the state\u2019s 2.2 million registered voters.",
      "But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion of the names on Pate\u2019s list are registered voters who are not U.S. citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he added.",
      "Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal fight over this year\u2019s election for months. Republicans have filed dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.",
      "Immigrants gain citizenship through a process called naturalization, which includes establishing residency, proving knowledge of basic American history and institutions as well as taking an oath of allegiance to the United States.",

    "summary": "Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting on Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike",
    "story": [
      "Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting on Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike",
      "Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger planes.",
      "A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing's offer, it would plunge the company into further financial peril and uncertainty.",
      "In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38% over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest, endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cIt is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,\" the union district said in scheduling Monday's vote. \"We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn\u2019t be right as we have achieved so much success.\u201d",
      "Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected, future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the result of the vote Monday night.",
      "Boeing has adamantly rejected requests to restore traditional pensions that the company froze nearly a decade ago. Pensions were a key issue for workers who voted down previous offers in September and October.",
      "If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by Nov. 12, according to the union.",
      "The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of Boeing's offer to raise pay by 25% over four years \u2014 far less than the union\u2019s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.",
      "Machinists voted down another offer \u2014 35% raises over four years, but still no revival of pensions \u2014 on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal.",
      "Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer.",
      "In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees\u2019 401(k) retirement accounts.",
      "Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if workers reject the new offer.",
      "The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times, including last week.",
      "The labor standoff \u2014 the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 \u2014 is the latest setback in a volatile year for the company.",
      "Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the plane's crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.",
      "As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about 17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company\u2019s credit rating from being cut to junk status. S&P and Fitch Ratings said last week that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade.",
      "The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane, and the 777 or \u201ctriple-seven\u201d jet and the cargo-carrying version of its 767 plane.",
      "Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company has too much debt, and \u201cserious lapses in our performance\u201d have disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company\u2019s strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion dollars."

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle",
      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

      "The last three hospitals still partially functioning in northern Gaza have been encircled by Israeli troops and caught amid fighting for weeks",
      "JERUSALEM -- They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire.",
      "Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare.",
      "All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes.",
      "It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as \u201ccommand and control bases\u201d to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals.",
      "\u201cIf we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids.",
      "Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed.",
      "But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials.",
      "It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events.",
      "The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman\u2019s office did not reply.",
      "In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said.",
      "As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives.",
      "\u201cWe are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,\u201d Salha said. \u201cWe have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.\u201d",
      "The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.",
      "Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient\u2019s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates.",
      "Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila\u2019s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said.",
      "By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became \u201ca death sentence,\u201d Obeid said.",
      "Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds.",
      "Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. \u201cCivilians!\u201d her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir.",
      "On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding.",
      "\u201cThe humiliation scared me more than death,\u201d Khalidi said.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza\u2019s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May.",
      "In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks.",
      "\u201cWhoever stays until the end will tell the story,\u201d it read in English. \u201cWe did what we could. Remember us.\u201d",
      "Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe bombing around us has increased. They\u2019ve paralyzed us,\" said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer.",
      "Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories.",
      "Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. \u201cPeople come to me to save them. \u2026 I can\u2019t do that by myself, with two doctors,\u201d he said in a voice message, his voice weak. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.",
      "The Indonesian is Northern Gaza\u2019s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble \u2014 all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023.",
      "Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound.",
      "The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month.",
      "After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply.",
      "It released images of two vehicles found in the compound \u2014 a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment.",
      "During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian\u2019s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to \u201cenemy fire\u201d from the hospital but denied using shells.",
      "Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it.",
      "For three weeks, wounded poured in \u2014 up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn\u2019t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling.",
      "Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground.",
      "\u201cTo see patients dying before your eyes because you don\u2019t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: \u2018Where is humanity?\u2019\u201d asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza\u2019s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week.",
      "Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital\u2019s director, Hossam Abu Safiya.",
      "In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cEverything we have built, they have burned,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThey burned our hearts. They killed my son.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital\u2019s oxygen tanks because they \u201ccan be booby traps,\u201d the official said.",
      "Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working.",
      "Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya\u2019s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia.",
      "The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were \u201cposing as medical staff.\u201d Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was \"fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.\u201d It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital.",
      "Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan.",
      "The turmoil echoed Israel\u2019s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man\u2019s finger.",
      "Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. \u201cEvery time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,\u201d said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained.",
      "The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants.",
      "As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. \u201cI thought, this makes no sense \u2014 who would they be shooting at?\u201d",
      "Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside.",
      "After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs.",
      "Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office said: \u201cLies were spread on social media\u201d about troops\u2019 activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military\u2019s activities.",
      "Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress.",
      "Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals \u201cprovide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.\u201d He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. \u201cAnd when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.\u201d",
      "Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided \u2014 one leading to Shifa's grounds.",
      "In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that \u201cIsrael has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.\u201d It described Israeli actions at hospitals as \u201ccollective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. \u201cThey are places of death,\u201d Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. \u201cYou can feel it.\u201d",
      "Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThis war has become a scar in the minds of every doctor and nurse.\u201d"

      "Robert F",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride.",
      "\u201cOn January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S\u200b. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, \u201cwant to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, \u201cbut it sounds OK to me. You know it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, \"He\u2019s going to have a big role in the administration.\u201d",
      "Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as \"a very talented guy and has strong views.\u201d",
      "The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump\u2019s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.",
      "In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.",
      "Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.",
      "In August, a federal agency determined \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it\u2019s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn\u2019t say what those measures should be.",
      "In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.",

      "Maryland is the first state to sign an agreement with the federal government designed to improve health care and lower costs",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland became the first state on Friday to join a federal program designed to improve health care quality and equity while lowering costs for all health care payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.",
      "It builds on Maryland\u2019s Total Cost of Care Model, which sets a per capita limit on Medicare\u2019s total cost of care in Maryland and encompasses the state\u2019s unique all-payer hospital payment system, which reduces per capita hospital expenditures and supports improved health outcomes, as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act.",
      "This new federal framework, known as the AHEAD model, has been designed to deliver high-quality health care through greater coordination, with a focus on health equity and social needs to support underserved patients.",
      "\u201cThe AHEAD model is the next chapter in health care, so we are proud to be writing that new chapter right here in the state of Maryland,\u201d said Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who signed the agreement with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure.",
      "Since the 1970s, Maryland has had a hospital all-payer system that enables the state to set its own rates for hospital services, and all payers must charge the same rate for services at a given hospital.",
      "It\u2019s designed to provide equitable access to care, eliminate the need for charity hospitals and ensure patients are treated the same regardless of insurance status. State law authorizes the system, which bases costs on rates set by hospitals. It has continued to be the foundation of each subsequent evolution of the Maryland health care model.",
      "\u201cMaryland has this unique system that we\u2019ve developed over a period of decades now,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told reporters after a news conference in Annapolis. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the next level by signing this AHEAD agreement, and the bottom line is it helps us accomplish three top priorities: equity, quality, affordability. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d",
      "The Maryland Department of Health will now begin planning to implement the AHEAD model starting Jan. 1, 2025. That will include establishing targets for cost growth, quality and equity improvements, population health, and primary care investments as well as identifying regional partnerships to drive AHEAD goals.",
      "Sen. Ben Cardin said the agreement keeps in place state policy that health care providers receive the same pay for services, so hospitals have incentives to provide equal care, whether you have private insurance, government insurance, or no insurance.",
      "\u201cSecondly, we are now committed to making sure that we have the most effective quality care,\u201d said Cardin, a Democrat. \u201cSo, we invest in primary care. We invest in early detection, prevention, so that we can keep you healthier, so you don\u2019t have to spend as much time with health care needs.\u201d",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has selected five other states \u2014 Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and regions of New York\u2014 for participation in the AHEAD Model.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s participation in the AHEAD Model is a critical step forward in improving the overall health of its residents, supporting primary care, transforming health care in communities throughout the state, and addressing disparities in the health care system,\u201d Brooks-LaSure said."

      "New Delhi's air quality index plunged into the \u201csevere\u201d category, according to SAFAR, India\u2019s main environmental monitoring agency. In many areas, levels of deadly particulate matter reached seven times the World Health Organization's safety limit.",
      "Authorities in the capital have banned the use and sale of traditional firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for environmentally friendly ones or light shows instead, but the rule is often flouted.",
      "New Delhi, home to more than 33 million people, is regularly ranked one of the most polluted cities in the world.",
      "The air pollution crisis deepens particularly in the winter when the burning of crop residue in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke. That smoke travels to New Delhi, leading to a surge in pollution and worsening the public health crisis.",
      "Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal, which produces most of the country\u2019s electricity, are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas.",
      "\u201cWe may not realize it now, but later we will face lung problems,\u201d said Manoj Kumar, a New Delhi resident who does his morning runs around the capital's iconic India Gate monument.",
      "Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. Tiny particulate matter in polluted air can lodge deep in the lungs and cause a variety of major health problems."

      "The latest attack came days after militants attacked a health center used in the ongoing anti-polio campaign in northwestern district of Orakzai, triggering a shootout that left two policemen dead. Three of the attackers were also killed in the exchange of fire.",
      "Militants in Pakistan often target police and health workers during campaigns against polio, claiming the vaccination drives are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",

      "While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright.",
      "\u201cI'm not aware of anything else like this,\u201d said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on \u201ca judgment of the medical product itself.\u201d",
      "The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID vaccines in the health district has declined \u2014 with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10.",
      "On Oct. 22, the health department\u2019s board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban \u2014 despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity.",
      "\u201cOur request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those (vaccines), recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. \u201cThis is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \u201ccontagion emergency kits\u201d that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\u201d Aberasturi said. \u201cThis is where we should be stepping in and helping.",

      "Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the \u201chealth and well-being\u201d of the district's residents. \"But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.\u201d",

      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

The indictment alleges that the long-term stays coupled with patient mistreatment resulted in babies' deaths.",
      "The prosecutor's office included hundreds of pages of transcripts of audio recordings in the indictment but the recordings themselves were not made available to the public.",
      "In one of the transcripts, a nurse and a doctor talk about how they mishandled the treatement of a baby and agree to fake the the hospital record. The transcript describes the nurse as saying: \u201cLet me write in the file the situation worsened, and the baby was intubated.\u201d",
      "Suspect Hakan Dogukan Tasci \u2014 a male nurse \u2014 is described as accusing Sari of compromising patient care by leaving just him in charge at the hospital instead of having a doctor present in the intensive care unit.",
      "Tasci is also described as accusing an ambulance driver, who is among the 47 who have been charged in the scandal, of transferring babies to some hospitals for \u201cprofit.\u201d",
      "\"He does not check whether the hospital is suitable for these newborn babies or not, he risks the lives of the babies and sends them to hospitals just to make money,\u201d the indictment quotes the male nurse as saying.",
      "In an interview with the Turkish newspaper BirGun, Dr. Esin Koc, president of the Turkey Neonatology Association, said that the private hospitals in the indictment most likely had \u201cinsufficient staff.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey made it seem like there were doctors who didn\u2019t exist,\u201d she told BirGun.",
      "She said that her association conducted inspections of the neonatal intensive care units of private, state and university hospitals in about 40 hospitals in 2017 and while university and state hospitals were good, \"there were problems in private hospitals at that time.\u201d",
      "After years of fertility treatment, Ozan Eskici and his wife welcomed twins \u2014 a boy and a girl \u2014 to one of Sari's hospitals in 2019. Although the babies initially appeared to be healthy, both were admitted to intensive care. The girl was discharged after 11 days, but the boy died 24 days later.",
      "During questioning by prosecutors, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment.",
      "He told prosecutors: \u201cEverything is in accordance with procedures.\"",
      "This week, a court in Istanbul approved the indictment and scheduled the trial date for Nov. 18 in a case that whose defendants are increasingly isolated.",
      "Lawyer Ali Karaoglan said he and two other attorneys who represented Sari during the investigation have recently withdrawn from the case. And authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed nine of the 19 hospitals implicated in the scandal, including one owned by a former health minister.",
      "The scandal has led main opposition party leader Ozgur Ozel to call for all hospitals involved to be seized by the state and nationalized. Erdogan said those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all blame on the country\u2019s health care system.",
      "\u201cWe will not allow our health care community to be battered because of a few rotten apples,\" Erdogan said, calling the alleged culprits \u201ca gang of people devoid of humanity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis gang ... committed such despicable atrocities by exploiting the facilities provided by our state to ensure citizens with higher quality and more accessible, affordable healthcare,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "Gokdeniz, who gave birth in 2020, said she trusted Sari and accepted her son\u2019s death as natural until she watched the scandal unfold in TV news and on social media.",
      "\u201cIt all started to fall into place like dominoes,\u201d she said.",

      "The debate over abortion rights is leading to expensive campaigns for state Supreme Courts in several states this year",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Abortion and reproductive rights have been central to the races for president and governor in North Carolina, a battleground state that has more moderate abortion restrictions than elsewhere across the South.",
      "That's been even truer in the fight for a seat on the state Supreme Court that abortion rights supporters say will play an important role in determining whether Republicans can enact even more restrictions. Registered Republicans currently hold five of seven seats and could expand that majority even further in Tuesday's election.",
      "Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat who is running for reelection, is focusing heavily on the issue and touts her support for reproductive rights. Her first television ad featured images of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, who prefers to restrict abortions earlier than the current 12 weeks. She says her GOP rival for the court could be a deciding vote on the bench for such restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that is landing in front of state Supreme Courts, and it is one that is very salient to voters now,\u201d Riggs said in an interview.",
      "Her Republican opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, said Riggs is saying too much about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate manner, a clear violation of our judicial standards, our code of conduct,\u201d he said.",
      "The North Carolina race emphasizes how much abortion is fueling expensive campaigns for Supreme Courts in several states this year. Groups on the right and left are spending heavily to reshape courts that could play deciding roles in legal fights over abortion, reproductive rights, voting rights, redistricting and other hot-button issues for years to come.",
      "Experts say the campaigns show how the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning constitutional abortion protections that had been in place for half a century has transformed races for state high courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Dobbs did was made clear to both political stakeholders and the public that these state courts that hadn't got a lot of attention are actually going to be really important and they're going to be deciding some of the biggest cases that people might have expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",
      "Thirty-three states are holding elections for 82 Supreme Court seats this year. The 2024 election cycle follows record-breaking spending for judicial races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last year.",
      "Groups on the left have ramped up their spending on state courts considerably this year. The American Civil Liberties Union has spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "\u201cWe have never invested this heavily in state Supreme Courts before,\u201d said Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThis is really a groundbreaking move for us, and I expect this will be the norm for us moving forward.\u201d",
      "The targets include Ohio, where Republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Democrats are defending two seats on the court, while a third is open, and Democratic victories in all three races are considered a longshot in the Republican-leaning state.",
      "Control of the court could be key if the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's abortion restrictions. The ruling said the law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters last year that protected reproductive rights.",
      "Two seats are up for election on Michigan's court, where Democratic-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority. Court races are technically nonpartisan, but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Republicans would need to win both seats to flip the court in their favor.",
      "Justice Kyra Harris Bolden is defending the seat she was appointed to two years ago by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bolden was the first Black woman to sit on Michigan\u2019s bench. She faces Republican-backed circuit court Judge Patrick O\u2019Grady for the remaining four years of the eight-year term.",
      "Republican state Rep. Andrew Fink is competing against University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas, who was nominated by Democrats, for the other open seat that is being vacated by a Republican-backed justice.",
      "Michigan voters already have locked abortion rights in the state constitution, though groups backing Bolden and Thomas are framing the races as crucial to defending those rights, with one group\u2019s ad warning that \u201cthe Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away.\u201d",
      "The most heated races are for two seats on the Montana Supreme Court, which has come under fire from GOP lawmakers over rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote.",
      "Former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch is running against county attorney Cory Swanson for chief justice, while state judge Katherine Bidegaray is running against state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups have been backing Lynch and Bidegaray. Both said in an ACLU questionnaire that they agreed with the reasoning and holding of a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to obtain a pre-viability abortion.",
      "Groups on the right have been painting them both as too liberal and echoing national Republicans' rhetoric, with text messages invoking the debate over transgender athletes on women's sports teams.",
      "The Republican State Leadership Committee, a longtime player in state court races, said its Judicial Fairness Initiative planned to spend seven figures in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "The group's ads are focusing on issues other than abortion. In one touting three Republicans running for Ohio's court, the group shows images of President Donald Trump along with images related to immigration.",
      "A super PAC backed by conservative donor and shipping executive Richard Uihlein also has given to groups involved in state Supreme Court races in Montana and Ohio.",
      "Progressive groups are even focusing attention on longshot states such as Texas, where Republicans hold all the seats on the Supreme Court. They're trying to unseat three GOP justices who were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state's abortion ban.",
      "One group, Find Out PAC, has been running digital ads in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston criticizing justices Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland. In its ad, the group accuses the three of \u201cplaying doctor from the bench.\u201d",
      "In North Carolina, Riggs' campaigning on abortion rights has prompted complaints from Republicans who say she's stepping outside the bounds of judicial ethics. But Riggs said she's not saying how she would rule in any case and is merely sharing her values with voters.",
      "\u201cI'm going to keep talking about my values because, at the core, our democracy works best when people cast informed votes,\u201d she said.",

The mandate is similar to a policy that debuted last year in Florida, where Republican Gov.

      "A pig at an Oregon farm was found to have bird flu",
      "NEW YORK -- A pig at an Oregon farm was found to have bird flu, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday. It's the first time the virus has been detected in U.S. swine and raises concerns about bird flu's potential to become a human threat.",
      "The infection happened at a backyard farm in Crook County, in the center of the state, where different animals share water and are housed together. Last week, poultry at the farm were found to have the virus, and testing this week found that one of the farm's five pigs had become infected.",
      "The farm was put under quarantine and all five pigs were euthanized so additional testing could be done. It's not a commercial farm, and U.S. agriculture officials said there is no concern about the safety of the nation's pork supply.",
      "But finding bird flu in a pig raises worries that the virus may be hitting a stepping stone to becoming a bigger threat to people, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University pandemic researcher.",
      "Pigs can be infected with multiple types of flu, and the animals can play a role in making bird viruses better adapted to humans, she explained. The 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic had swine origins, Nuzzo noted.",
      "\u201cIf we're trying to stay ahead of this virus and prevent it from becoming a threat to the broader public, knowing if it's in pigs is crucial,\u201d Nuzzo said.",
      "The USDA has conducted genetic tests on the farm's poultry and has not seen any mutations that suggest the virus is gaining an increased ability to spread to people. That indicates the current risk to the public remains low, officials said.",
      "A different strain of the bird flu virus has been reported in pigs outside the U.S. in the past, and it did not trigger a human pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t a one-to-one relationship, where pigs get infected with viruses and they make pandemics,\u201d said Troy Sutton, a Penn State researcher who studies flu viruses in animals.",
      "This version of bird flu \u2014 known as Type A H5N1 \u2014 has been spreading widely in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and a number of other animals. Its persistence increases the chances that people will be exposed and potentially catch it, officials say.",
      "It isn't necessarily surprising that a pig infection was detected, given that so many other animals have had the virus, experts said.",
      "The Oregon pig infection \"is noteworthy, but does it change the calculation of the threat level? No it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Sutton said. If the virus starts spreading more widely among pigs and if there are ensuing human infections, \"then we\u2019re going to be more concerned.\u201d",
      "So far this year, nearly 40 human cases have been reported \u2014 in California, Colorado, Washington, Michigan, Texas and Missouri \u2014 with mostly mild symptoms, including eye redness, reported. All but one of the people had been to contact with infected animals.",

      "Louisiana\u2019s new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances is being challenged in a state court lawsuit by a physician, a pharmacist, two women who had difficult pregnancies and others",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana's new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances\u201d was challenged in a state court lawsuit Thursday by a physician, a pharmacist and others who say the legislation sets up needless, dangerous delays in treatment during medical emergencies.",
      "Although there already was a near-total abortion ban in Louisiana, including by medication, the reclassification of the drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol, which have other critical reproductive health care uses \u2014 went into effect earlier this month. Proponents of the law said more oversight and control over the drugs was needed to prevent coerced abortions. They have used as an example a Texas case in which a pregnant woman was given seven misoprostol pills by her husband without her knowledge. The baby survived.",
      "Doctors critical of the law have said it could harm patients facing emergency complications such as postpartum hemorrhages by requiring medical personnel to go through extra steps and more stringent storage requirements to use the drugs.",
      "\u201cEven short delays in accessing misoprostol can be life-threatening for postpartum hemorrhage patients,\u201d says the lawsuit. It says the law violates the Louisiana Constitution in multiple ways, including a prohibition on discrimination based on a person's physical condition.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill said she had not seen the lawsuit as of Thursday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t respond to a lawsuit we have not seen, but I\u2019m confident this law is constitutional,\" she said in a statement. \"We will vigorously defend it.\u201d",
      "In addition to the physician and the pharmacist, who the lawsuit says is pregnant, the plaintiffs in the case include the Birthmark Doula Collective, an organization of people trained to provide pregnancy care before, during and after birth.",
      "Other plaintiffs include Nancy Davis, a woman who was denied an abortion in Louisiana and traveled out of state for one after learning her fetus would not survive. A woman who said she was turned away from two emergency rooms instead of being treated for a miscarriage is also part of the lawsuit.",
      "Prior to the reclassification, a prescription was still needed to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol in Louisiana. The new law reclassified the pills as \u201cSchedule IV drugs,\u201d putting them in the same category as the opioid tramadol and other substances that can be addictive.",
      "The new classification means that if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years.",
      "The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "The legislation is a first-of-its-kind law in the U.S. While GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, many Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups have touted the new classification, doctors have warned of deadly delays that the law could cause.",
      "Under the new classification, doctors say there are extra steps and more stringent storage requirements, which could slow access to the drugs in emergency situations. Beyond inducing abortions, the pills are also used to treat miscarriages, induce labor and stop hemorrhaging.",
      "Prior to the law, some doctors said that misoprostol would be stored in a box in the hospital room, on the delivery table or in a nurse's pocket. But under the new requirements of the classification, the drugs may be down the hall in a locked container or potentially in-house pharmacy at smaller hospitals.",

      "It happened in 2021 and while details are murky surgery was avoided and the man is still alive. But donor registries in the U.S. and even across the Atlantic are being impacted after the case was publicized recently. A drop in donations could cost the lives of people awaiting a transplant.",
      "\u201cOrgan donation is based on public trust,\u201d said Dorrie Dils, president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, or OPOs. When eroded, \u201cit takes years to regain.\u201d",
      "Only doctors caring for patients can determine if they're dead -- the law blocks anyone involved with organ donation or transplant. The allegations raise questions about how doctors make that determination and what\u2019s supposed to happen if anyone sees a reason for doubt.",
      "Key is ensuring \u201call doctors are doing the right tests and doing them well,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, a Georgetown University bioethicist.",
      "The 2021 case first came to light in a congressional hearing last month, with unconfirmed details in later media reports \u2013 allegations that a man who\u2019d been declared dead days earlier woke up on the way to the operating room for organ-donation surgery and that there was initial reluctance to realize it.",
      "The federal agency that regulates the U.S. transplant system is investigating, and the Kentucky attorney general\u2019s office said it is \u201creviewing the facts to identify an appropriate response.\u201d A coalition of OPOs and other donation groups is urging that findings be made public quickly and the public withhold judgment until then, saying any deviation from the industry's strict standards would be \u201centirely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Donate Life America found an average of 170 people a day removed themselves from the national donor registry in the week following media coverage of the allegations \u2013 10 times more than the same week in 2023. That doesn\u2019t include emailed removal requests or state registries, another way people can volunteer to become a donor when they eventually die.",
      "Dils' own organ agency, Gift of Life Michigan, usually gets five to 10 calls a week from people asking how to remove themselves from that state\u2019s list. In the last week, her staff handled 57 such calls, many mentioning the Kentucky case.",
      "Unlike the voluntary U.S. donation system, French law presumes all citizens and residents will be organ and tissue donors upon death unless they clearly opt out.",
      "After the reports from Kentucky reached France, the number joining that nation\u2019s donation refusal registry jumped from about 100 people a day to 1,000 a day in the past week, according to the French Biomedicine Agency.",
      "Dr. R\u00e9gis Bronchard, an agency deputy director, said the spike \u201creflects anxiety, incomprehension among the general public\u201d that could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences.\u201d",
      "Doctors can declare two types of death. What\u2019s called cardiac death occurs when the heart stops beating and breathing stops, and they can\u2019t be restored.",
      "Brain death is declared when the entire brain permanently ceases functioning, usually after a major traumatic injury or stroke. Ventilators and other machines keep the heart beating during special testing to tell.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to become an organ donor \u2013 most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue.",
      "But most organ donations are from brain-dead donors. Only after that declaration does the donor agency assume responsibility for the deceased, looking for potential recipients and scheduling retrieval surgery \u2014 while typically nurses at the hospital where the person died continue care to ensure equipment properly maintains their organs until they're collected.",
      "The donor agency and transplant surgeons arriving to retrieve organs must check records of how death was determined. Anyone \u2013 donor hospital employees, donor agency staff or surgeons \u2013 who sees anything concerning is supposed to speak up immediately.",
      "\u201cThis is extremely rare,\u201d Dr. Ginny Bumgardner, an Ohio State University transplant surgeon who also leads the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, said of the Kentucky case.",
      "In operating rooms \u201cthe whole process stops\u201d if someone sees a hint of trouble, and independent doctors are called to doublecheck the person really is dead, Bumgardner said. In her 30-year career, \u201cI\u2019ve never had a case where the original declaration was wrong.\u201d",
      "Georgetown\u2019s Sulmasy agreed problems are infrequent. But he said there\u2019s wide variation in what tests different hospitals perform to determine if someone\u2019s brain-dead, whether they\u2019re a potential organ donor or not. Doctors are debating whether to add additional test requirements.",
      "Stricter criteria could \u201cassure the public that we have done enormous due diligence before we determine that somebody\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. It could help \u201cto get people to stop ripping up their organ donor cards.\u201d",
      "\u2014-",

      "Mississippi\u2019s Republican legislative leaders say they plan to push for Medicaid expansion to cover working people who earn to little to afford private insurance",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi's Republican legislative leaders said Thursday that they plan to push for Medicaid expansion to cover working people who earn too little to afford private insurance \u2014 a position that business groups have advocated but that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves opposes.",
      "House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann spoke about their 2025 policy priorities to hundreds of business people and community leaders at Hobnob, a social gathering hosted by Mississippi Economic Council, the state chamber of commerce.",
      "Medicaid expansion is an option under the health overhaul that then-President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the U.S., and it\u2019s one of 10 states that have not expanded the program. The vast majority of funding for the expansion would come from the federal government, but the state would have to cover some costs.",
      "Reeves, though, refers to Medicaid as \u201cwelfare\u201d and has frequently said he does not want more people to enroll. The governor usually speaks at Hobnob, which is held at the Mississippi Coliseum on the state fairgrounds. But he did not appear at the event this year.",
      "MEC and two other business groups \u2014 the Mississippi Manufacturers Association and the Business and Industry Political Education Committee \u2014 released a joint statement in April when legislative leaders were negotiating over the possibility of Medicaid expansion. The groups said expanding access to health care would lead to \u201ca healthier population, a healthier workforce, and an improved quality of life, all of which contribute to stronger Mississippi communities.\u201d",
      "The three groups said they trust elected officials and state agencies \u201cto use federal dollars responsibly.\u201d",
      "Reeves is in his second term as governor after two terms as lieutenant governor.",
      "Hosemann said Thursday that Medicaid expansion could help about 75,000 working people who can\u2019t afford insurance, and he noted: \u201cThere\u2019s a governor that doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with some of our proposals.\"",
      "White said he has heard politicians say elected officials should run the state like a business.",
      "\u201cProviding affordable access to health care for low-income workers is a smart investment in our workforce, and it is exactly the business-minded approach that all of you would take in your own individual businesses,\u201d White said.",
      "The three-month legislative session begins in early January.",
      "White said some of his other big goals for the session are phasing out the state income tax, reducing the 7% sales tax on groceries and enacting a plan to let children attend public schools outside the districts where they live.",
      "Hosemann said the Senate will propose a reduction in the grocery tax. He did not list a phase-out of the income tax or a school choice plan among his policy priorities. He mentioned that Mississippi is already in a years-long process of reducing its personal income tax under a law enacted in 2022."

The lawsuit was brought after a series of deaths in 1988 revealed significant shortcomings at AMHI, which closed in 2004. It was replaced by the Riverview Psychiatric Center.",

      "The Maine Department of Health and Human Services plans to follow Wathen's recommendation in hopes of delivering a \u201clong-awaited resolution to the consent decree,\u201d said Commissioner Sara Gagn\u00e9-Holmes.",

    "story": [
      "Millions who could benefit from hearing aids have never tried them",
      "Some Apple AirPods wireless headphones can be used as hearing aids with a new software update available Monday. It's a high-profile move that experts applaud, even if they only reach a small portion of the millions of Americans with hearing loss.",
      "An estimated 30 million people \u2014 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 12 \u2014 have hearing loss in both ears. Millions would benefit from hearing aids but most have never tried them, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Countless others have tried them, but don't use them because of cost, poor quality, poor fit, how they look or for other reasons.",
      "Over the past few years, there\u2019s been a push to change that. Two years ago, federal rules changed to allow hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, a move that many hoped would bring better and cheaper options to patients. And last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved software from Apple that would turn AirPods Pro 2 into hearing aids.",
      "It's unclear yet whether the rule changed has helped, experts say. But turning AirPods into hearing aids is the kind of creative move advocates had hoped for. Here's what to know about hearing loss, hearing aids, and Apple\u2019s new option.",
      "About 15% of Americans report some difficulty hearing. Most people with hearing loss are over 60, but hearing problems don't only affect older people. One study found men and people living in rural areas are more likely to have hearing loss.",
      "And it has been linked to many health effects beyond the ear. It contributes to isolation, depression and cognitive decline, experts say. It raises dementia risk and rewires the brain. It's also been linked to an increased risk of falls \u2014 a major health concern among older adults.",
      "\u201cEverything we do, all our relationships, whether it\u2019s personal or in our work life, involve hearing conversation,\u201d said Barbara Kelley, executive director of Hearing Loss Association of America. \u201cWe\u2019re finding now that the sooner that people can pay attention to their hearing health, the better.\u201d",
      "Before the 2022 rule change by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, everyone had to see a doctor and get a prescription for a hearing aid to get one. Now, they're available without one.",
      "\u201cAs more of them are sold, then hopefully the price will go down,\u201d said Elizabeth Stangl, an audiologist at the University of Iowa. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen a big rush to get them.\u201d",
      "Even buying over-the-counter, a decent hearing aid can easily run you $400 to $500, said Stangl, who researches how well people adjust to using hearing aids. And some of the less expensive options are really just \u201ccheap amplifiers,\" lacking the personalized level settings and noise canceling features that really make hearing aids helpful.",
      "The hearing aid feature is available with AirPods Pro 2 models, and requires an iPhone or iPad to set it up. It starts with built-in tests that will help users determine if they have hearing loss, set up the feature if they do, and set personalized amplification levels.",
      "The headphones sell for $249 on Apple's website, and sometimes less from other retailers.",
      "While there are many other earbud-type devices that can function the same way, experts agreed that the AirPods addition is a good one, simply because of the way it could help normalize hearing aids.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just mainstream,\u201d Kelley said. The ubiquity of AirPods could make people worried about the look of a hearing aid more open to using them.",
      "There may be some drawbacks, though. Fit and comfort during long use might be an issue. And while other hearing aids are built to last through a whole day or more, Stangl said the battery life of the AirPods won't allow for that. She also noted that wearing earbuds can send a message to others that the person doesn't want to be disturbed or spoken to.",
      "\"But we\u2019re hoping that more people will try it and realize, \u2018Yeah, these do help,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Stangl suggests people do plenty of research before buying. She said Facebook and Reddit forums can be especially helpful in vetting devices. The websites Hearing Tracker and Soundly also have reliable reviews and resources for selecting a hearing aid, she said.",
      "The Hearing Loss Association of America and American Academy of Audiology have guides to buying a hearing aid at their websites. If you are stuck, consult an audiologist.",
      "Look for devices that allow you to adjust different pitches. Most people with hearing loss have the hardest time hearing higher pitches, so find a device that can adjust amplification across frequencies.",
      "To avoid the piercing whistle of feedback, buy a device that has a \u201cfeedback manager.\u201d Fit is critical, but beware: it might not necessarily be the one that\u2019s initially the most comfortable, so take your time.",
      "Pre-tax money stashed away in flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts can be used to buy hearing aids, including ones sold over the counter.",
      "Does this mean you can score a new set of AirPods Pro2 with pre-tax money? Experts say it\u2019s a gray area that hasn\u2019t been tested yet, so be wary. You may even need a letter of medical necessity. It\u2019s best to check with an accountant before you try it.",
      "Even if you can't afford the latest and greatest tech, your smartphone can be a tool to protect and improve your hearing.",
      "Most phones can now turn speech into text, which can help facilitate conversations. iPhone's \u201cLive Listen\u201d feature turns your phone into an amplifying microphone that can beam your dinner date's voice right to your ear even if you're in a noisy restaurant.",
      "There are also many apps and websites that can help beyond hearing aids. Some apps can vibrate your phone if an alarm is going off or the dog is barking. The University of Iowa gathers training resources through its Resource Center for Auditory Training. Free apps like the World Health Organization's \u201chearWHO\u201d offer hearing tests and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Sound Level Meter App lets you measure if noise levels are dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe majority of people own smart phones and don\u2019t realize all that their phone can do, including functioning as a good amplifier for people with mild to moderate hearing loss,\u201d said Catherine Palmer, director of audiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and former president of the American Academy of Audiology. \u201cThis has made hearing care accessible to many.\u201d",

      "Pakistan has begun a nationwide vaccination campaign to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.",
      "Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.",
      "The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday \u201cin response to the alarming increase in polio cases,\u201d said Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. \u201cWe are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.",
      "Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. \u201cPolio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,\u201d he said.",
      "Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.",
      "The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan say the Taliban\u2019s recent decision will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other\u2019s country.",
      "Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world\u2019s most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated. In severe cases, polio can cause permanent paralysis and death.",
      "In Afghanistan, a Public Health Ministry spokesman said Monday that vaccinations have started in 16 of the country\u2019s 34 provinces. The campaign will last three days and target 6.2 million children under the age of 5, said Sharafat Zaman.",
      "\u201cIt is worth mentioning that we do not have any positive confirmed cases of polio in 2024 and we are trying to prevent this virus through vaccination,\u201d said Zaman.",
      "Data from the World Health Organization says there have been 23 confirmed cases in Afghanistan this year. That\u2019s up from six cases in 2023.",
      "The immunization will take place in mosques and community hubs known as hujra, rather than door-to-door. That means people will have to take children to vaccinators, instead of health workers going house-to-house as is the norm.",
      "Zaman did not respond to questions about who is carrying out the immunizations, what will happen to female polio workers, and what impact a mosque or hujra-based campaign will have on vaccination rates.",
      "Women are not allowed to enter mosques or hujras.",
      "Mothers or female carers may face other hurdles to access polio vaccines for children, like not being able to move freely without a male guardian or not being allowed in front of a man who is unrelated to them through blood or marriage.",
      "The WHO has been contacted for comment about the Taliban-led vaccination drive."

The person was not sick while traveling, so the risk to fellow airline passengers is \u201cextremely low,\u201d officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The virus is not spread by casual contact and patients are not believed to be infectious before symptoms occur.",
      "The patient had been hospitalized in isolation at the University of Iowa Health Care Medical Center. Testing by the Nebraska Laboratory Response Network early Monday showed that the patient was presumptively positive for Lassa fever. If the results are confirmed, the Iowa case would be the ninth known case of Lassa fever since 1969 in travelers returning to the U.S. from areas where the disease is found.",

Some people may develop vomiting, difficulty breathing, facial swelling and pain in the back, chest or stomach.",
      "Those identified as close contacts will be monitored for 21 days.",
      "State and local health officials are working to learn how the patient, who they did not identify, became infected. Early information suggests the patient had contact with rodents in West Africa. The virus is carried by rodents and spread to humans through contact with urine or feces droppings of infected animals.

      "Many refugees in Uganda are struggling to get by without the food assistance they once depended on",
      "RWAMWANJA, Uganda -- For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat.",
      "\u201cAs a woman who\u2019s not married, life is hard,\u201d Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals \u201ckeep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,\u201d said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family.",
      "Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities.",
      "Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo.",
      "Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations.",
      "Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment.",
      "In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged.",
      "Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage.",
      "The international community \u201cshould not take Uganda\u2019s generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,\u201d Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. \u201cServices here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.\u201d",
      "He also said international support \"is urgently needed to sustain Uganda\u2019s commitment to refugees,\u201d urging donors and humanitarian partners to \u201ccome together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.\u201d",
      "Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported.",
      "Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi\u2019s visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was \u201coverloaded\u201d with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:22:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for one year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research",

      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for one year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research",
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for a year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research, the company announced Thursday.",
      "The results underscore the difficulties in treating schizophrenia, a severe mental illness that can cause people to hear voices, feel paranoid and withdraw from others. High dropout rates are typical in schizophrenia drug studies.",
      "Finding a drug that works can be a long ordeal punctuated by crises and hospitalizations. Side effects of existing medications \u2014 weight gain, tremors, restlessness \u2014 cause some people to stop taking medicine and relapse.",
      "There's been great hope among doctors for Cobenfy, which was approved in September, because it acts in the brain differently than other schizophrenia drugs. Instead of blocking dopamine receptors, Cobenfy\u2019s main ingredient, xanomeline, works on a different receptor that indirectly blocks dopamine release.",
      "Cobenfy also contains trospium, which blocks some of the side effects. The most common are nausea, vomiting and indigestion. In contrast to the weight gain seen with other schizophrenia drugs, people lost a few pounds while taking Cobenfy, made by Bristol Myers Squibb.",
      "Dr. John Krystal of Yale University has led research on other schizophrenia drugs but was not involved in the new studies. He noted that just 10% to 20% of participants in the new studies dropped out because of side effects.",
      "\u201cThat is pretty good,\u201d he said, noting that fewer or milder side effects could mean people will stay in treatment longer. That could mean fewer problems associated with untreated mental illness: substance use, homelessness and unemployment.",
      "So why did some patients stick with treatment while others dropped out? Krystal said it will be important to understand more about that as doctors start prescribing the drug.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved Cobenfy on the strength of two encouraging company-sponsored five-week trials and other safety data. The latest results announced Thursday at the Psych Congress meeting in Boston come from two longer studies, providing a fuller picture.",
      "In one study, focused on severely ill patients, 78% dropped out, leaving only 35 people for the final analysis. In the other, focused on more stable people, 51% left the study, leaving 283 who took the drug for a year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any higher or any lower than what we typically see\u201d in schizophrenia studies, said Dr. Greg Mattingly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Mattingly is a consultant for Bristol Myers Squibb and a researcher on one of the studies.",
      "In the more severely ill group, 69% of people had a meaningful improvement in their symptoms at the end of the year. In the other group, 30% saw a meaningful benefit.",
      "Results of interviews with a sample of study participants conducted by an independent research team and shared by Bristol Myers Squibb showed the likelihood of continuing treatment. After six months, 36 said they would continue taking Cobenfy after the trial if given the option; 10 said they would not. Some participants said the drug reduced the voices while others said it didn't work for them.",
      "The estimated yearly cost for Cobenfy is $22,500 compared to $540 for a generic antipsychotic. Krystal and others worry that insurers will require people to try cheaper drugs first before covering Cobenfy. Most patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs will be much lower, depending on insurance and other factors.",
      "One cheaper generic called clozapine is widely considered one of the best treatments for schizophrenia, Krystal said. It is underused in the U.S. compared to some other countries because of a cumbersome blood testing program.",
      "The FDA started the blood tests to watch for the risk of severe neutropenia, a rare side effect which can be fatal. But doctors and families have told the FDA that patients have relapsed when their clozapine was withheld or delayed because of the testing requirements.",
      "Sally Littlefield, 29, of Alameda, California, said what works for her is a monthly injection of a long-acting antipsychotic medication. Littlefield, who has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, wants to learn more about the experiences of people who've taken Cobenfy and not just from players with a financial stake.",
      "Mindy Greiling of Roseville, Minnesota, wants to see data on how Cobenfy compares to clozapine, which works for her 47-year-old son, Jim. Weight gain was a problem for him, but since taking diabetes medication, he\u2019s back to his normal weight, Greiling said.",
      "Cobenfy \u201cis getting a lot of ballyhoo, as any new drug does,\u201d Greiling said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstarter for me unless it turns out that it\u2019s better than clozapine.\u201d",

    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet across. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38.1 million televisions sold with a width of at least 97 inches between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85\u201d TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said."

    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",

      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation.

      "Conservationists and a Native American advocacy group are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting on Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike",
      "Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger planes.",
      "A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing's offer, it would plunge the company into further financial peril and uncertainty.",
      "In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38% over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest, endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cIt is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,\" the union district said in scheduling Monday's vote. \"We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn\u2019t be right as we have achieved so much success.\u201d",
      "Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected, future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the result of the vote Monday night.",
      "Boeing has adamantly rejected requests to restore traditional pensions that the company froze nearly a decade ago. Pensions were a key issue for workers who voted down previous offers in September and October.",
      "If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by Nov. 12, according to the union.",
      "The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of Boeing's offer to raise pay by 25% over four years \u2014 far less than the union\u2019s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.",
      "Machinists voted down another offer \u2014 35% raises over four years, but still no revival of pensions \u2014 on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal.",
      "Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer.",
      "In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees\u2019 401(k) retirement accounts.",
      "Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if workers reject the new offer.",
      "The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times, including last week.",
      "The labor standoff \u2014 the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 \u2014 is the latest setback in a volatile year for the company.",
      "Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the plane's crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.",
      "As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about 17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company\u2019s credit rating from being cut to junk status. S&P and Fitch Ratings said last week that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade.",
      "The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane, and the 777 or \u201ctriple-seven\u201d jet and the cargo-carrying version of its 767 plane.",
      "Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company has too much debt, and \u201cserious lapses in our performance\u201d have disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company\u2019s strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion dollars.",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",

      "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- As the price of fuel soared in Ethiopia earlier this year, Awgachew Seleshi decided to buy an electric car. That aligned with the government's new efforts to phase out gas-powered vehicles. But months later, he's questioning whether it was the right decision.",
      "He faces a range of issues, from the erratic supply of electricity in Addis Ababa, the capital, to the scarcity of spare parts.",
      "\u201cCharging my car has been a challenge,\" the civil servant said. \u201cSpare parts that are imported from China are expensive, few mechanics are able to fix such cars and the resale value of such cars is poor.\u201d",
      "Seleshi's troubles point to wider challenges for Ethiopia. In January, the East African country became the first in the world to ban the importation of non-electric private vehicles.",
      "The decision eased pressure on authorities who spend scarce foreign currency to subsidize the cost of fuel, but it also reflected growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles as the world demands more green technologies to reduce climate-changing emissions.",
      "Earlier this month, Ethiopia's government raised the price of fuel by up to 8% as part of a plan to gradually end all fuel subsidies in Africa's second-most populous country.",
      "Authorities have claimed some success in enforcing the ban on non-electric vehicles entering Ethiopia, and more than 100,000 electric cars are now being imported into the country each month.",

      "As part of a sweeping two-year investigation into prison labor, The Associated Press found that correctional staff nationwide have been accused of using inmate work assignments to sexually abuse incarcerated women, luring them to isolated spots, out of...",
      "HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- It was after midnight when she crept down the narrow, dimly lit stairs carrying a bag of dirty laundry. She crossed under a patchwork of pipes and ducts to the far back corner of the basement, as she had done many times before. That, she said, is where correctional officer James Widen was waiting for her.",
      "He had just called her name over the intercom, telling her to report to the work release center\u2019s laundry room. So April Youst rose from her bunk, careful not to wake the other incarcerated women sleeping in the dorm.",
      "When she got downstairs, she said Widen offered to save her some money by opening \u201cthe cage,\u201d a little room with free washers and dryers reserved for new prisoners who hadn\u2019t yet started their jobs.",
      "She gratefully stepped inside. And then, she said, everything changed.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s rubbing himself,\u201d she said, while reminding her of all the little favors he\u2019d done for her. \u201cHe was like \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s time to pay.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her account of that night to The Associated Press mirrors, almost word for word, the complaint she filed with police eight years ago. Widen was charged two years later and pleaded not guilty, but the case continues to crawl through the criminal court system. He vehemently denied the allegations to the AP, contending he was set up.",
      "Youst is part of the fastest-growing population behind bars \u2014 women, most of whom are locked up for nonviolent crimes that often are drug-related. Though female prisoners long have been victims of sexual violence, the number of reports against correctional staff has exploded nationwide in recent years. Many complaints follow a similar pattern: Accusers are retaliated against, while those accused face little or no punishment.",
      "In all 50 states, the AP found cases where staff allegedly used inmate work assignments to lure women to isolated spots, out of view of security cameras. The prisoners said they were attacked while doing jobs like kitchen or laundry duty inside correctional facilities or in work-release programs that placed them at private businesses like national fast-food restaurants and hotel chains.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you\u2019re thinking about when you\u2019re coming into intake is, \u2018How am I going to stay safe?\u2019\u201d said Johanna Mills of Just Detention International, a nonprofit organization working to end sexual violence behind bars. When she was incarcerated, she said her boss smashed her in the head and raped her after bringing her to an empty gym one night to do electrical work. \u201cIt never occurred to me to watch my back from the supervisor,\u201d she said.",
      "As part of a two-year investigation that has exposed everything from multinational companies benefiting from prison labor to incarcerated workers\u2019 lack of rights and protections, AP reporters spoke to more than 100 current and former prisoners nationwide, including women who said they were sexually abused by correctional staff.",
      "The AP also scoured thousands of pages of court filings, police reports, audits and other documents that detailed graphic stories of systemic sexual violence and cover-ups from New York to Florida to California.",
      "Those cases prompted a bipartisan Senate investigation two years ago that found prisoners were sexually abused by wardens, guards, chaplains or other staff in at least two-thirds of all women\u2019s federal prisons over the past decade. But a backlog of thousands of cases has impeded the Bureau of Prison\u2019s ability to hold employees accountable, government investigators said.",
      "The Prison Rape Elimination Act, passed more than 20 years ago, created a channel for filing reports that resulted in a threefold increase in the number of allegations of staff sexual misconduct involving male, female and transgender inmates from 2010 to 2020 at jails and prisons nationwide.",
      "Just over a month ago, U.S. lawmakers held a hearing to discuss how to better safeguard inmates. One woman, Bonnie Hernandez, testified that she was raped repeatedly and violently by officer Lenton Hatten in a Florida federal prison after he made her clean the recreation area as part of her work detail.",
      "\u201cIt got to the point where I feared for my life and had no choice but to report him, even though I was terrified to do so,\u201d she said. In response, she said she was sent to isolation, then transferred to a facility with greater restrictions and no access to video calls with her daughters. Still, it was one of the rare cases that led to prosecution, boosted by DNA evidence. Hatten faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. He received only three months last year after pleading guilty to sexual abuse of a ward.",
      "\u201cWhat you allow is what will continue,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, said after her testimony. \u201cThree months for rape is absurd. \u2026 That\u2019s not justice.\u201d",
      "Sometimes, even a confession isn\u2019t enough to lead to punishment. At another federal facility in Florida, a guard who had sex with women on landscape duty was among at least six men who were not prosecuted even though they admitted to the misconduct during an internal investigation, according to the Senate report. That was in part because, by law, government employees cannot be criminally charged if they are compelled to make statements.",
      "Internationally, prison rape is recognized as a form of torture. While it is illegal in the U.S, correctional officers have argued in some states that \u2013 despite the clear power imbalance \u2013 inmates gave their consent. Laws vary widely. For example, sexual abuse of an inmate can be a misdemeanor in Kentucky with a maximum sentence of 12 months, but prison rape is a felony in Pennsylvania, carrying up to seven years behind bars.",
      "Correctional staff often quit or retire before internal investigations are complete, sometimes retaining pensions and other benefits, experts say. With no paper trail and severe staff shortages, some are simply transferred or hired at other facilities or they land positions overseeing vulnerable populations like juveniles, the AP found.",
      "Officer Widen took a job in West Virginia after resigning from a women\u2019s prison in neighboring Ohio. According to an internal investigation submitted as part of civil court filings, he had delivered a ring from an inmate to a former prisoner. He told the AP there was no sexual contact and that he quit after upsetting prison officials by launching his own investigation into heroin smuggling at the facility, transporting the ring in exchange for information from the inmate.",
      "Youst said she had no concerns about Widen when she first arrived at the Huntington Work Release Center. In fact, she said he was a favorite among many of the men and women living there, sometimes sneaking them cigarettes or warning them about shakedowns. She said he also helped make a write-up against her go away after she was caught with a contraband cellphone \u2013 an incident that could have gotten her sent back to prison and farther away from her young daughter, who was living just down the street.",
      "As a guard, Widen held incredible power over the women. They had earned their places at the program, allowing them to dip a toe back into the free world. Though work assignments inside prisons may pay only pennies an hour, outside opportunities \u2014 which easily can be taken away \u2014 allow women to earn a little more money before their release.",
      "Youst had been in and out of the system for years for crimes stemming from her addiction. She was working days at a local mattress company when she was called down to the laundry room that night in early 2016. She told police \u2014 and the AP \u2014 that Widen started touching himself over his pants. Then, she said, he told her the cameras couldn\u2019t see what he was about to do.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s already pulling his pants down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hear his belt.\u201d",
      "She said she desperately tried to reason with him, stressing that someone could walk in on them and that the women upstairs in the dorm might miss her if she was gone too long.",
      "And then, echoing the account she gave police, she said, \u201cHe just pretty much bent me over the washing machine.\u201d",
      "Youst said she is baffled by how the case has dragged on.",
      "Widen has been free since posting bond after his arrest in 2018. He told the AP that all allegations of sexual misconduct at the work release center are untrue, labeled Youst \u201ca career criminal\u201d and said the police were unjustly after him.",
      "\u201cMy rights have been violated every which way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide. I didn\u2019t do anything I was accused of. West Virginia is crooked.\u201d",
      "West Virginia, a rugged swath of Appalachia that has been home to the country\u2019s highest overdose death rate for a decade, has experienced one of America\u2019s sharpest spikes in female incarceration rates, with a more than 200 percent increase in state prisons between 2000 and 2016 \u2014 which is precisely when lawyers started fielding sexual abuse complaints.",
      "AP reporters met with current and former prisoners inside correctional facilities and at their homes in mountain communities, some of whom said staff members often started out being nice \u2014 bringing them fast food or makeup \u2014 and then raped them, peeped at them in showers or forced them to strip and perform sex acts on other prisoners while the guards watched.",
      "Most female victims locked up nationwide were abused before being incarcerated, research shows. They rarely report assaults, fearing they won\u2019t be believed or will be punished, ranging from losing their jobs to being placed in solitary confinement or denied contact with their children. And many on work release have only a short time left to serve and are wary of doing anything that could send them back to prison or add time to their sentences.",
      "In most cases nationwide, internal investigations determine that allegations are \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d And in the cases that have enough evidence to wind their way through the legal system, only 6% of the nearly 1,000 staff who reportedly engaged in sexual misconduct with male and female inmates in 2019 and 2020 were convicted, according to the latest Department of Justice figures. Without prosecution, perpetrators also can avoid placement on sex offender registries.",
      "In West Virginia, Amanda McGrew, the state\u2019s compliance director for the Prison Rape Elimination Act, said some prisoners use the act to file complaints unrelated to sexual abuse because they know it will trigger the removal of an officer until an investigation is completed. Police are alerted when accusations are substantiated and it\u2019s up to prosecutors to take a case forward, she said. And even when staff resign, she added, investigations continue.",
      "But there is another route: Huntington-based attorney Michael Woelfel has sought restitution through a stream of civil suits.",
      "Woelfel, who also is a Democratic state senator, said he has settled 127 cases in which women accused guards of abuse in the past 15 years, forcing the state\u2019s insurance carrier to pay out millions of dollars.",
      "He said he first started receiving calls from women jailed for crimes linked to their addiction after judges took a hard line, locking them up to try to straighten them out. He had known some of them since they were girls, appearing before him when he oversaw preliminary juvenile delinquency cases that sometimes involved sexual or physical abuse at home.",
      "Most lawyers wouldn\u2019t touch their prison rape claims, and not just because they are hard to win due to qualified immunity \u2014 a high bar that helps protects people in law enforcement from liability resulting from misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere is a certain element of people that think if you go to prison, you sort of get whatever you get in there,\u201d Woelfel said, adding that while he is still contacted by women alleging sexual misconduct, the slew of lawsuits has helped pressure the state to crack down. \u201cThat taboo of rape or sexual assault \u2026 it\u2019s so commonplace that people still joke about that.\u201d",
      "Women have been targeted from their days on slave plantations, when they were raped by their owners, to the decades-long period that followed emancipation and involved leasing convicts out to private companies. Widespread reports of abuse eventually led to the creation of reformatories, where women no longer were overseen by men.",
      "That began to change in the 1970s after anti-discrimination laws opened the door for cross-gender supervision, just as the number of women being locked up started to rise. Though they now represent only about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s overall prison population, female incarceration rates have jumped from about 26,000 in 1980 to nearly 200,000 today.",
      "Some guards believe women with substance abuse issues are accustomed to using sex as a commodity on the streets, seeing them as partly responsible for their own victimization, said Brenda Smith, a law professor at American University and one of the country\u2019s top experts on prison rape.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re viewed as sort of the lowest of the low,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not really women \u2014 they\u2019re just other things.\u201d",
      "Youst said her case appears to bear that out. She\u2019s out of prison and said she\u2019s working to stay clean, holding down a busy job while building a new life.",
      "Even before the languishing criminal case, Youst and three others from the Huntington work release center came forward to file civil suits against Widen. The cases were settled by the state\u2019s insurance carrier for $240,000 in 2019, with no admission of any wrongdoing, Woelfel said. The AP interviewed three of the women. The fourth died of an overdose before the agreement was reached.",
      "Widen contended the women were driven by a payday and plotted together, saying, \u201cMe, too! Me, too! Me, too!\u201d",
      "But Alesha Canfield, who was among the four women filing suit, said she talked to no one about Widen at the center.",
      "She said she was worn out from working morning and afternoon shifts at two major restaurant chains, but still struggled to sleep at night, worried that Widen would tap her on the shoulder in the dorm and summon her to the center\u2019s basement.",
      "\u201cI was terrified. I did what I was told,\u201d she said to the AP, noting that she waited to file a rape report until after leaving the facility because she feared retaliation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the criminal,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s the cop. So why are they going to believe me anyway?\u201d",
      "Canfield, who related the same story in civil court filings, said it\u2019s hard to understand why abuse behind bars isn\u2019t taken more seriously.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all women,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because we made a mistake and got caught once in our lives doesn\u2019t mean that we should be treated any different than any other woman in this world.\u201d",
      "A recent spike in scandals, cover-ups and lawsuits linked to women\u2019s facilities nationwide has prompted congressional investigations and scathing Department of Justice reports that cited a \u201cculture of abuse.\u201d Experts say powerful unions sometimes work to shield staff from allegations of misconduct. And in some cases, correctional officers who speak out are retaliated against.",
      "Things were so bad at FCI Dublin in California that prisoners and staff named it \u201cthe rape club,\u201d a 2022 AP investigation found. At least two men who pleaded guilty to sexual abuse were work supervisors: Nakie Nunley targeted at least five female prisoners who worked at the federal government\u2019s call center, where inmates are employed by companies to do jobs like telemarketing and customer service. And Andrew Jones abused women who worked for him in the kitchen. The correctional facility was recently shut down; Nunley and Jones have been imprisoned along with at least five others, with another case still pending.",
      "Brandy Moore White, who heads the union representing nearly 30,000 correctional staff in federal prisons, condemned sexual abuse inside facilities and pointed to a need for more resources amid \u201ccatastrophic\u201d staffing shortages.",
      "\u201cThe most e\ufb03cient way to provide security and oversight is not cameras and technology, it is sta\ufb03ng,\u201d she told lawmakers during a recent Senate subcommittee hearing, noting that employees also face sexual violence and harassment from inmates. \u201cIf you have 10 staff supervising 500 inmates, there is time for people who have ill intentions to do things that they shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "Many accusations note that guards took special care to avoid surveillance video. A civil lawsuit filed in September said that officer Jose Figueroa-Lizarraga moved cameras in an Arizona state facility and raped a prisoner who was on a job assignment, forcing her inside the guard\u2019s control room. After reporting the incident, the woman was attacked again, the suit said \u2014 alleging that the second time, even her request for emergency contraception was ignored. She became pregnant and nearly died after hemorrhaging during childbirth.",
      "Figueroa-Lizarraga also was prosecuted on criminal charges and pleaded guilty to a lesser crime of attempting to commit unlawful sexual conduct by a custodian. He was sentenced to two years probation in August.",
      "In some cases, the allegations of abuse extend beyond prison walls.",
      "Correctional officer Anthony Martin kept his job at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail even after several female inmates alleged he sexually abused them by creating special work assignments. Then in March, while off-duty in Queens, he was arrested for allegedly raping a woman in the community. In that case, the district attorney moved swiftly. Martin was indicted by a grand jury in August for first-degree rape and faces up to 25 years if convicted.",
      "\u201cThis disparity sends a chilling message - that the dignity and rights of the incarcerated are worth less than those on the outside,\u201d said attorney Anna Kull, who is representing a woman who alleges Martin abused her while she was locked up.",
      "Other correctional officers accused of abuse sometimes transition into working with even more vulnerable populations. Youst said it was Widen possibly taking a new job that ultimately spurred her to act.",
      "\u201cI heard him say something about juveniles \u2014 you know, working in a juvenile facility. That\u2019s when I knew I had to say something,\u201d she said.",
      "Youst believed she had something that might stop him from going anywhere else. She told police that Widen didn\u2019t use a condom that night and pulled a handful of napkins out of his coat pocket when he was done.",
      "\u201cHe gave them to me and stood in front of me and made me wipe myself off,\u201d she said to the AP, as she previously had told police. \u201cI threw them in the trash can, and he\u2019s like, \u2018No, give them back to me.\u2019\u201d",
      "As soon as he stepped aside, she said she raced back upstairs to her dorm, pulled off her fleece pajamas and black T-shirt and hid them. She tried to avoid being alone with Widen again, but said the abuse continued.",
      "One winter morning, she said she stuffed a plastic bag containing the clothes from that night into her coat and left the work release center for her job. She called the one person she had heard could help \u2013 attorney Michael Woelfel.",
      "He met her at the mattress factory and took the bag to the police, handing it over for DNA testing in a state where prisoners cannot legally consent regardless of circumstances. Though questions were raised at the lab about the chain of custody, it was a match for Widen.",
      "Widen was working in West Virginia\u2019s juvenile services department when he was charged with two counts of felony sex acts against a prisoner \u2014 Youst. His bail was set at $25,000, and he was released on bond six years ago.",
      "He told the AP that his DNA could have come from somewhere else in the center \u2014 or even from his disgruntled ex-wife.",
      "Since being charged, Widen has been assigned three defense lawyers by the state. The original judge retired. And a new prosecuting attorney, whose office declined comment, is now on the case.",
      "Widen has attended multiple hearings at the Cabell County courthouse and is expected to appear again this month. A trial date has not been set.",
      "Just down the street sits the building that once housed the work release center. It was shut down seven years ago due to disrepair, and today operates as an addiction wellness center.",
      "Nothing looks the same from Youst\u2019s time there \u2014 except the laundry room and the cage in the basement corner.",

    "story": [
      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a slimmed-down version earlier this year",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a sharply slimmed-down version earlier this year.",
      "Inslee urged permitting officials to work quickly to allow the construction of as many Horse Heaven Wind Farm turbines as possible, The Seattle Times reported. Washington state won't meet its \u201curgent clean energy needs\u201d if officials take years to authorize the turbines, he said.",
      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "Exxon\u2019s net production reached 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the third quarter, an increase of 5% compared with the previous quarter.",

      "McLoughlin ran Dubai Duty Free from 1983 until he retired earlier this year, a span of over 40 years that saw Dubai grow from a creekside trading port into a modern metropolis, home to the world's tallest building and other attractions.",
      "And all the millions of passengers coming into Dubai International Airport, now the world's busiest for international travel, saw the rows of electronics, cigarettes, cigars, alcohol and other goods available duty-free at his stores, hawked by a salesforce in green suit jackets, yellow ties and conversing in multiple languages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very Middle Eastern kind of thing,\u201d McLoughlin told the Los Angeles Times in 1987 as he showed off its gold market. \u201cWe have to cater to a lot of tastes.\u201d",
      "Dubai Duty Free said in a statement that McLoughlin died Wednesday after a short illness, without elaborating. The operation's new managing director, Ramesh Cidambi, praised McLoughlin for steering its \u201cgrowth to a $2 billion dollar business with over 6,000 employees at the time of his retirement.\u201d",
      "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, offered condolences for his death Friday.",
      "\u201cWith a heavy heart, we mourn the passing of Colm McLoughlin, a distinguished visionary whose dedication transformed Dubai Duty Free into a global icon over more than four decades,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed wrote on the social platform X. \u201cColm was an inspiring and humble figure, one of the beautiful faces of Dubai and a brilliant mind with a kind and loving heart.\u201d",
      "Born in Ballinasloe, Ireland, in 1943, McLoughlin joined Shannon Airport's first-in-the-world duty-free operation in 1969. In July 1983, he came with a 10-man team to Dubai to set up the sandy airport's duty-free operation. His six-month contract ended up stretching into 40 years.",
      "Like the rest of the aviation industry, Dubai Duty Free took a hit during the years of the coronavirus pandemic and airline groundings. But sales have since bounced back. In 2023 alone, under McLoughlin, Dubai Duty Free sold 6 million cans of beer, 2.3 million bottles of whiskey, 2.3 million cartons of cigarettes, 10.2 million cigars and 3.3 million bottles of perfume.",
      "One big segment has been Chinese travelers, after Dubai Duty Free worked to accept their credit cards, had staff speaking Mandarin and put in goods they wanted.",
      "\u201cWe would be silly if we didn\u2019t take advantage of it and try to serve them,\u201d McLoughlin told The Associated Press in 2012.",
      "And many a bleary-eyed traveler in Dubai's cavernous airport tried their luck at the constant raffles being offered, whether for $1 million, a luxury automobile or a racing motorcycle.",
      "McLoughlin also was known for Dubai Duty Free's sponsorship of tennis and golf tournaments, as well as his work supporting Dubai's Irish community. He received the Irish Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2014.",
      "\u201cColm McLoughlin has been an integral part of the Irish community in the UAE,\u201d his award citation read. \u201cBoth in his highly successful professional career with Dubai Duty Free and in his leadership roles across almost every Irish organization, Colm McLouglin has played a hugely positive role in the promotion of Irish interests in the UAE.\u201d",
      "McLoughlin is survived by his wife Breeda, son Niall, daughters Tyna and Mandy, and their families."

      "Wendy\u2019s President and CEO Kirk Tanner said the restaurants that are closing are underperforming compared to others.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Kamala Harris ' campaign is actively warning business leaders that Donald Trump has a pattern of disregard for democracy and the rule of law that would threaten U.S. economic growth \u2014 a closing argument designed to show the possible consequences for companies and workers if he returns to the White House.",
      "It\u2019s a position that Trump's team rejects as they tell voters that prices will be lower and growth stronger than ever before if he wins Tuesday's election. As a billionaire who made his name in real estate, the former president has argued for higher tariffs to bring more factories into the United States and tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations on the premise that will lead to more investment.",
      "The rival positions get at a fundamental distinction between the two candidates on how to guide the world\u2019s largest economy: Harris\u2019 team is arguing that the rule of law creates the certainty that can make markets and workers thrive, while Trump is arguing that tariff increases and tax cuts are the keys for growth.",
      "Gene Sperling, who has guided three Democratic presidents on economic policy and is now advising the Harris campaign, has made what he describes as a \u201ccommon sense\u201d case to financiers and others about the dangers of a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cA president who targets people, targets CEOs, targets companies, targets journalists and targets opposition could have a devastating impact on the investment confidence that has been robust for the past four years but also part of America\u2019s strength since its founding,\u201d said Sperling.",
      "But the billionaire hedge fund investor John Paulson, a Trump supporter who sees himself as a possible treasury secretary, pushes back against the Harris campaign's criticisms by saying the world was more stable under Trump and inflation was lower.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely false,\" he said of Sperling's argument about the rule of law being at risk. \"When people make these claims, they\u2019re totally spurious. They\u2019re not grounded in reality. Trump is a brilliant businessman. He wants to bring down wasteful spending and encourage growth.\u201d",
      "Trump has derided his opponent's handling of the economy as \u201cstupid\u201d and claimed the stock market will crash if he loses the election, although the S&P 500 index of stocks has increased roughly 50% during President Joe Biden 's term.",
      "\u201cWe will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet,\u201d Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Allentown, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe problem is, if we had more of these idiots running our country, you won\u2019t have a big and best market anymore because we\u2019re a nation in decline.\u201d",
      "The Harris team's push involves connecting the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol with Trump's history of using the bully pulpit to attack the Federal Reserve as well as companies such as Amazon, Merck, Comcast, John Deere and Toyota. Their argument is that companies are less likely to make long-term investments if democratic values are under attack and election results denied.",
      "In addition to Sperling, corporate executives have been hearing from Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary; Kenneth Chenault, the former CEO of American Express; and Brian Deese, the former National Economic Council director for Biden.",
      "One person familiar with the conversations said that the representatives of the Harris campaign are not having to push hard on this issue. Seemingly apolitical CEOs are privately raising this issue as their central concern about a Trump presidency, with the person insisting on anonymity to describe the private conversations with business leaders who want to stay out of the electoral spotlight.",
      "But Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution, said that the Harris campaign has somewhat underplayed the risks given the possible hazards.",
      "\u201cBy and large, Americans have been able to take the basic rule of law for granted,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe kind of rampant cronyism and fraud that is endemic in some other countries has really been unimaginable here\u00ad\u00ad \u2014 and that\u2019s a great thing, of course. But it also makes it difficult for people to conceive of just how important government is for the functioning of markets.\u201d",
      "Both campaigns are vying for support from the business community. Trump has the backing of billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter. Billionaires such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban are backing Harris.",
      "Many of the disputes have centered on policy differences. Trump has said that the higher corporate tax rates favored by Harris would deter investment, while the Harris team has attacked his plans to remove Biden-era incentives for building computer chip, electric vehicle and other advanced factories as costing the country factory jobs.",
      "But the argument about the importance of democratic values picked up credibility in October after the Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded to three economists, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson, who showed that social institutions and the rule of law are critical for economic growth.",
      "Acemoglu was among the 23 Nobel prize-winning economists who signed a letter saying Trump's economic plans would \u201clead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality.\u201d",
      "The letter said: \u201cAmong the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these.\u201d",
      "The topic has long fascinated Harris, a former California attorney general. Two people working in the White House recalled that in 2022, Harris asked for economic research to back her own understanding that the erosion of democratic standards would harm growth. Those people insisted on anonymity to discuss the request.",
      "Similarly, Biden was the nominee, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients made the case to the CEOs in the Business Roundtable that a Trump return to the presidency would generate uncertainty that would hinder growth. It was a pitch that contrasted with Trump floating additional tax cuts to the group.",
      "Neither the Business Roundtable nor the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have made endorsements in November's presidential election. The Business Roundtable has made keeping corporate tax rates at their current 21% rate its top legislative priority. Trump has pledged further cuts to the corporate rate for U.S. manufacturers, whereas Harris would like to raise it to 28%, an increase though still lower than the 35% rate in place until 2017.",
      "The Chamber, meanwhile, has emphasized its willingness to advocate for its corporate members with whichever administration would be in power.",
      "Business Roundtable CEO Josh Bolten said in a statement this month that the organization supported the peaceful transfer of power. So far, Trump has declined to commit to the peaceful transfer of power, after having falsely claimed that his 2020 loss was the result of a rigged election, a claim that helped encourage the 2021 insurrection.",
      "\u201cIt can take time to finalize election results, and we urge all Americans to respect the processes set out in federal and state laws for electoral determinations and an orderly transition,\" Bolten said."

      "Next week\u2019s presidential election isn\u2019t just a referendum on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris",
      "WASHINGTON -- Next week's presidential election isn't just a referendum on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. It's also a measure of the influence the world's richest man wields over American democracy.",
      "Elon Musk, the South African-born tech and business titan, has spent at least $119 million mobilizing Trump's supporters to back the Republican nominee. His social media platform, X, has become a firehose of pro-Trump propaganda. And he's playing a starring role in Trump-style rallies in critical battleground states.",
      "All the while, he's coming under growing scrutiny. He skipped a hearing on Thursday in a lawsuit over his effort to dole out millions of dollars to registered voters, giveaways legal experts liken to vote buying. He\u2019s being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Musk regularly communicates with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a potential national security risk because SpaceX, his aerospace company, holds billions of dollars worth of contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense.",
      "Musk is hardly the only person whose megawealth places him at the nexus of politics, business and foreign policy. But few are working so publicly for a single candidate as Musk, whose expansive business ties and growing bravado pose a vexing test of one unelected person's political power. His stature is perhaps one of the most tangible consequences of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which eliminated many limits on political giving.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely an election brought to you by Citizens United,\u201d said Daniel I. Weiner, the director of elections and government at the Brennan Center for Justice, who added that the phenomenon was bigger that just Musk. \u201cWhat this is really about is a transformation of our campaign finance system to one in which the wealthiest donors are playing a central role.\u201d",
      "Musk did not respond to a request for comment made through his attorney. Tesla, his electric car company, and X did not respond to inquiries. SpaceX disputed parts of The Journal's reporting in a statement and said it continues to work in \u201cclose partnership with the U.S. Government.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s conversion to a self-described \u201cDark MAGA\u201d Trump warrior is a recent one. In the past, he donated modest sums to both Republicans and Democrats, including $5,000 to Hillary Clinton in 2016, records show. He didn\u2019t contribute to Trump\u2019s political efforts until this year, according to federal campaign finance disclosures.",
      "He was all in once he did.",
      "Musk is now leading America PAC, a super political action committee that is spearheading Trump\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort.",
      "As a newcomer to politics, there have been growing pains.",
      "Over the summer, America PAC struggled to reach its voter contact goals. Musk brought in a new team of political consultants, Generra Peck and Phil Cox, who worked on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2019 losing Republican presidential primary bid.",
      "On paper, the numbers have improved. But Republican officials, operatives and activists say in some critical places it\u2019s been difficult to tell how active the PAC\u2019s ground effort has been.",
      "The PAC's presence is not perceptible in rural Georgia, according to three Republican strategists who are closely monitoring the ground game in the battleground state. For example, America PAC has shown little evidence of leaving literature behind on doorsteps, as is common when a voter is not home, especially in remote places, the three people said.",
      "There are also indicators Musk, a tech innovator, has been taken advantage of at his own game. In Nevada, three other people familiar with America PAC\u2019s efforts said hired canvassers paid tech-savvy operatives to digitally manipulate an app used to track their progress \u2014 appearing to falsify their data so they could get paid for work that they did not do. Canvassers are typically paid by the number of doors that they knock on.",
      "There are signs the practice wasn't limited to Nevada. One person warned America PAC leadership weeks ago that canvasing data from multiple states showed signs that it had been falsified, but their concerns were not acted on, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The individuals, like others who provided details about Musk\u2019s political operation, insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter out of fear of retribution.",
      "Musk has become frustrated with the inner workings of his political organization and has brought in private sector associates, including Steve Davis, president of the Boring company, Musk\u2019s tunnel building company, according to three people with knowledge of the move. Davis\u2019 role with America PAC was previously reported by The New York Times.",
      "A person close to the PAC disputed that the group had been taken advantage of, suggesting it was a conspiracy theory based on a poor understanding of how political canvassing works. The person insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the innerworkings of the PAC.",
      "Musk\u2019s leadership of the PAC has not been his only political stumble.",
      "On Monday, Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney filed a lawsuit to halt Musk\u2019s $1 million cash sweepstakes, which is a part of America PAC\u2019s effort to garner support for Trump. Musk had pledged to give away $1 million a day until the election to voters in battleground states who have signed a petition supporting the Constitution. Legal experts cautioned that the contest was likely illegal, venturing into vote buying territory because participants were required to be registered to vote to win the money.",
      "Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner\u2019s suit argues the giveaways amount to an illegal lottery. A state judge put the case on hold on Thursday while a federal court considers taking action. The Department of Justice sent a warning letter to America PAC that the giveaways could violate election law.",
      "Musk has more riding on the election than just bragging rights.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the main agency that regulates Tesla, has repeatedly proved to be a thorn for the electric car maker run by Musk, which is the primary source of his wealth. The agency is overseeing more than a dozen recalls, some that Tesla resisted. It has also opened investigations that have raised doubts about Musk\u2019s claims that Tesla is close to deploying self-driving vehicles, a key expectation of shareholders and a major driver of Tesla\u2019s lofty share price.",
      "Earlier this year Tesla disclosed that the Department of Justice and the SEC have requested and subpoenaed information about \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d capability, vehicle functionality, data privacy and other matters.",
      "The social media platform X is another Musk company that has drawn interest of the Biden administration. The Federal Trade Commission has probed Musk\u2019s handling of sensitive consumer data after he took control of the company in 2022 but has not brought enforcement action. The SEC has an ongoing investigation of Musk\u2019s purchase of the social media company.",
      "Musk has been forceful with his political views on the platform, changing its rules, content moderation systems and algorithms to conform with his world view. After Musk endorsed Trump following an attempt on the former president\u2019s life last summer, the platform has transformed into a megaphone for Trump\u2019s campaign, offering an unprecedented level of free advertising that is all but impossible to calculate the value of.",
      "Many of his troubles, which Musk blames President Joe Biden and Democrats for, could go away if Trump is elected. The former president has mused that Musk could have a formal role in a future Trump administration that focuses on government efficiency \u2014 an enormous conflict of interest given Musk\u2019s companies' vast dealings with the government.",
      "Musk has even offered to help develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles, alarming auto safety groups, which also worry that he could interfere with investigations of Tesla.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety watchdog group.",
      "That\u2019s also what makes the revelation that Musk has been in regular contact with Putin so troubling to foreign policy experts. The Defense Department and NASA are heavily dependent on SpaceX to launch spy satellites and take astronauts into space. But The Wall Street Journal reported that during one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite system, a subsidiary of SpaceX, over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Russia has denied that the conversation took place.",
      "In a statement posted to X, the aerospace company said the Journal story included \u201clong-ago debunked claims\u201d and questioned the relevance of the newspaper's reporting on Taiwan.",

      "National security experts say the revelation that Musk communicated with Putin is still troubling.",

That makes this wrong in my view,\u201d former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told The Associated Press last week. \u201cYou have to decide what team you are on.

      "\u201cWe have overcome every attack, every abuse and even two assassination attempts,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, outside Charlotte. \u201cAnd now it all comes down to this.\u201d",

      "Online video production company MrBeast says it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire\u2019s workplace culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",
      "The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or \u201cknowingly\u201d employed people with \u201cproclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\"",
      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",
      "The company \u201chas grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,\u201d Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. \u201cIt is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.\u201d",
      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI \u2014 marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \u201c100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\u201d",
      "In a Friday post on X sharing Spiro's letter, Donaldson wrote that he \u201cwas asked to refrain from making public statements to enable a detailed and unbiased investigation.\u201d",
      "Pansino, one of Donaldson\u2019s most vocal critics, responded on X that the findings of \u201cworkplace harassment and misconduct\u201d and \u201cmultiple firings\u201d mean \"it might be time for a bigger investigation.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's level of fame and growth place him in \u201cpretty rare company,\u201d said advertising lawyer Robert Freund, whose practice helps creators resolve disputes. He said he suspects the letter was released in attempt to assure stakeholders \u201cthat he's running a professional operation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything fishy or suspicious about what we\u2019ve been presented with here as the public,\u201d Freund told The Associated Press.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to recover some of its loss from the day before, which was its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 288 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8%.",

      "In the bond market, Treasury yields pushed higher following some swings after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only a net 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month. That was far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September.",
      "The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week.

      "The Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign  in September with a larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, as it turns more attention to keeping the job market solid instead of focusing on just driving inflation lower.",
      "The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed\u2019s actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20% from 4.18% late Thursday.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth and other factors into account, likewise rose after a knee-jerk drop. It climbed to 4.37%, up from 4.29% late Thursday.",
      "Economists said Friday\u2019s jobs report contained a lot of noise and perhaps not much signal. Besides two hurricanes that left destructive paths across the United States during the month, a strike by workers at Boeing  also helped depress the numbers.",
      "All those distortions make the numbers difficult to parse, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t change our view that the labor market should further decelerate in coming months,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.",
      "The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with that expected slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared.",
      "A separate report on Friday said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It\u2019s been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Fed\u2019s keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions.",
      "Berkshire said it sold off about 100 million more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The remaining stake of roughly 300 million shares was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion.",
      "Investors will also be disappointed to learn that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares in the quarter.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said shareholders will wonder why Buffett is continuing to accumulate so much cash. \u201cAre they more pessimistic about the future economic and market picture than perhaps others are?\u201d she said.",
      "Buffett said at the annual meeting in May that part of why he started selling some of his Apple shares is that he expects tax rates to go higher in the future. But Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he wonders if part of the reason Buffett started selling Apple is tied to last year's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger because the sales started shortly after Munger's death. Shanahan said Buffett has never been as comfortable with technology businesses as his longtime partner was.",
      "\u201cIf Charlie Munger were still alive, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have sold down the position quite as aggressively \u2014 maybe at all,\u201d Shanahan said.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share.",
      "Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire\u2019s bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,335.11 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at $92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported $93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the $92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.",

      "Berkshire did resolve one mystery from the quarter by spelling out how much it paid to acquire the rest of the shares in its utility business from the estate of former Berkshire board member Walter Scott.",
      "Berkshire said it paid $2.4 billion cash, issued $600 million in debt and gave the Scott family Class B Berkshire shares worth a little over $1 billion. So the total compensation was about $4 billion. That means the Scott family didn\u2019t get nearly as good of a price for their 8% stake in the utilities as when Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel sold his 1% stake in the utility business two years ago for $870 million.",
      "Abel is slated to succeed the 94-year-old Buffett as CEO in the event of his death."

      "Worries about this week\u2019s tax-raising U.K. budget within financial markets appear to have eased with the interest rates charged on British debt steadying and the pound rising against most other currencies",
      "LONDON -- Worries about this week's tax-raising U.K. budget within financial markets appeared to ease Friday with the interest rates charged on British debt steadying and the pound rising against most other currencies.",
      "In the wake of Wednesday's budget statement, the first by a Labour government for 14 years, British financial assets have been choppy, with investors taking a more risk-averse approach by selling both government bonds and the pound.",
      "The budget saw taxes raised by 40 billion pounds ($52 billion), proportionately the biggest for over three decades, and borrowing and spending increased \u2014 a combination that clearly unnerved some investors.",
      "Some analysts voiced worries about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, which may prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates more slowly than previously anticipated. Though the bank is widely expected to reduce its main interest rate next week by a further quarter-point to 4.75%, the markets have moved to price in fewer reductions next year in the wake of the budget.",
      "Other analysts said the public finances will likely need to be bolstered again in coming years if the U.K.'s economic growth doesn't pick up. The Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent watchdog, said in its assessment of the budget that the measures would do little to boost growth levels over the coming years.",
      "On Friday, the yield, or interest rate, charged on the U.K.'s 10-year bonds held steady at 4.45%, following increases since Treasury chief Rachel Reeves presented the budget. The pound meanwhile was up 0.4% to $1.2951.",
      "Ahead of the statement, Reeves was clearly aware of how a budget can go wrong and prompt panic in financial markets. Two years ago, the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss foundered after a series of unfunded tax cuts sent borrowing costs surging.",
      "\u201cThough the market\u2019s allergic reaction is unwelcome for the new Labour government, the response has been much more muted than after the Conservative\u2019s mini-Budget of September 2022. \u201d said Andrew Goodwin, chief U.K. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "The overall increase in taxes announced by Reeves comes in large part from an increase in a tax businesses pay for employing people. The 1.2 percentage-point increase in employers' national insurance contributions, along with the fact that the levy will be paid on lower incomes, is forecast to raise 25 billion pounds.",
      "Many executives have expressed concern about the move, arguing that it may depress wages by prompting firms to seek a way of absorbing the additional costs.",
      "The center-left Labour Party won a landslide election victory July 4 after promising to end years of turmoil and scandal under successive Conservative governments, get Britain\u2019s economy growing and restore frayed public services. But the scale of the measures announced on Wednesday by Reeves exceeded Labour\u2019s cautious general election campaign."

      "If he drives up turnout in rural and suburban parts of swing states this can offset the loss of moderate, college-educated Republicans.",
      "5. He\u2019s seen as a strong man in an unstable world",
      "Trump\u2019s detractors say he undermines America\u2019s alliances by cosying up to authoritarian leaders.",
      "The former president sees his unpredictability as a strength, however, and points out that no major wars started when he was in the White House.",
      "Many Americans are angry, for different reasons, with the US sending billions to Ukraine and Israel - and think America is weaker under Biden.",
      "A majority of voters, especially men who Trump has courted through podcasts like Joe Rogan's, see Trump as a stronger leader than Harris.",
      "1. She\u2019s not Trump",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s advantages, he remains a deeply polarising figure.",
      "In 2020, he won a record number of votes for a Republican candidate, but was defeated because seven million more Americans turned out to support Biden.",

      "2. She\u2019s also not Biden",
      "Democrats were facing near-certain defeat at the point Biden dropped out of the race. United in their desire to beat Trump, the party quickly rallied around Harris. With impressive speed from a standing start, she delivered a more forward-looking message that excited the base.",
      "While Republicans have tied her to Biden\u2019s more unpopular policies, Harris has rendered some of their Biden-specific attack lines redundant.",
      "The clearest of these is age - polls consistently suggested voters had real concerns about Biden\u2019s fitness for office. Now the race has flipped, and it is Trump who\u2019s vying to become the oldest person to ever win the White House.",
      "3. She's championed women's rights",
      "This is the first presidential election since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion.",
      "Voters concerned about protecting abortion rights overwhelmingly back Harris, and we\u2019ve seen in past elections - notably the 2022 midterms - that the issue can drive turnout and have a real impact on the result.",
      "This time around, 10 states, including the swing state Arizona, will have ballot initiatives asking voters how abortion should be regulated. This could boost turnout in Harris\u2019s favour.",
      "The historic nature of her bid to become the first female president may also strengthen her significant lead among women voters.",
      "4. Her voters are more likely to show up",
      "The groups Harris is polling more strongly with, such as the college-educated and older people, are more likely to vote.",
      "Democrats ultimately perform better with high-turnout groups, while Trump has made gains with relatively low-turnout groups such as young men and those without college degrees.",
      "Trump, for example, holds a huge lead among those who were registered but didn\u2019t vote in 2020, according to a New York Times/Siena poll.",
      "A key question, then, is whether they will show up this time.",
      "5. She\u2019s raised - and spent - more money",
      "It\u2019s no secret that American elections are expensive, and 2024 is on track to be the most expensive ever.",
      "But when it comes to spending power - Harris is on top. She\u2019s raised more since becoming the candidate in July than Trump has in the entire period since January 2023, according to a recent Financial Times analysis, which also noted that her campaign has spent almost twice as much on advertising.",

      "A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza is expected to resume on Sunday, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) said six people, including four children, were injured following a strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic.",
      "The agency did not say who was responsible for the attack but an official from Gaza's civil defence agency told AFP news agency it was carried out by an Israeli quadcopter. Israel said it is investigating but does not believe it was responsible.",
      "Unicef, the UN's children's agency which is helping to lead the vaccination rollout, described the strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic as \"another example of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians\".",
      "The second phase of the vaccine rollout began on Saturday after being postponed in October due to intense Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access in the region.",
      "Gaza recorded its first case of polio in 25 years in August, which left a baby boy paralysed and prompted the rollout of the programme.",
      "The immunisations are resuming as 15 UN and humanitarian organisations have described the situation in north Gaza as \"apocalyptic\" nearly a month after an Israeli ground offensive began.",
      "A humanitarian pause in the fighting has been agreed upon to allow vaccinations to restart in Gaza City, the WHO said. The campaign will run for three days.",
      "In a post on X on Saturday, WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said the centre was struck \"while parents were bringing their children to the life-saving polio vaccination in an area where a humanitarian pause was agreed\".",

      "The WHO had aimed to give 119,000 children in the area a second dose of the oral polio vaccine.",
      "The agency added that achieving this target \"is now unlikely due to access constraints\".",
      "The first round of the vaccine campaign successfully reached 559,000 children under 10 years old over three phases in south, central and north Gaza between 1 and 12 September, during which there were local \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d agreed by Israel and Palestinian groups.",
      "However, the area agreed in the latest humanitarian pause \"has been substantially reduced\" compared to the first round of vaccinations and is now limited to just Gaza City, according to the WHO.",
      "From the start of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, medical experts stressed that delays in administering the second dose could jeopardise overall efforts to halt transmission of the contagious, potentially deadly disease.",
      "To interrupt transmission, at least 90% of all children need to be given a minimum of two doses.",
      "The UN human rights chief said last week that the Gaza war's \u201cdarkest moment\u201d is unfolding in the north of the territory.",

      "At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from north Gaza towards Gaza City for safety, the WHO said.",
      "The joint statement from UN agencies, including the WHO, released on Friday, said the situation was \"apocalyptic\", with the entire Palestinian population in the area \"at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence\".",
      "The UN estimates that about 100,000 residents remain in dire conditions, with severe shortages of food, water and medical supplies.",
      "The US warned Israel this week to immediately increase humanitarian aid into Gaza as a deadline approaches to boost aid or face cuts to American military assistance. The US envoy to the UN said on Tuesday that Israel's words \"must be matched by action\", which was \"not happening\".",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who had died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week engagement at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vigorous energy of Jones's new arrangements. No wonder that it was chosen as the opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa-craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily-segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fit the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "When Vaughan died in 2019, Jones posted a long tribute on his Facebook page, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote.",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "Typically, the votes cast on election day are tallied first, followed by early and mail ballots, those that have been challenged, and then overseas and military ballots.",
      "Local election officials - sometimes appointed, sometimes elected - verify, process and count individual votes, in a process known as canvassing.",
      "Verifying ballots includes comparing the number cast with the number of active voters; removing, unfolding and examining every single ballot for tears, stains or other damage; and documenting and investigating any inconsistencies.",
      "Counting ballots involves feeding each one into electronic scanners that tabulate their results. Some circumstances require manual counts or double-checked tallies.",

      "Tight margins will compel media outlets to wait longer before making their projections, but they also raise the spectre of recounts and legal challenges.",

      "What happens if the presidential election results are challenged?",
      "Once every valid vote has been included in the final results, and after processes such as recounts have been completed, the election results are certified - first in local jurisdictions, then at the state-wide level.",

      "He urged his vice-president, Mike Pence, to reject the results - but Pence refused.",
      "Even after the riot was cleared and members of Congress regrouped, 147 Republicans voted unsuccessfully to overturn Trump's loss.",
      "Electoral reforms since then have made it harder for lawmakers to object to certified results sent to them from individual states, and have also clarified that the vice-president has no power to unilaterally reject electoral votes.",
      "Nevertheless, election watchers expect that efforts to delay certification of the 2024 vote could take place at the local and state level.",
      "Trump, his running mate JD Vance and top Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have refused on several occasions to state unequivocally that they will accept the results of the election if he loses.",

      "It's the single largest allocation of funds ever for space projects in India, but considering the scale and complexity of the projects, they are far from lavish and have once again brought into focus the cost-effectiveness of India\u2019s space programme.",
      "Experts around the world have marvelled at how little Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) Moon, Mars and solar missions have cost. India spent $74m on the Mars orbiter Mangalyaan and $75m on last year\u2019s historic Chandrayaan-3 \u2013 less than the $100m spent on the sci-fi thriller Gravity.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Maven orbiter had cost $582m and Russia\u2019s Luna-25, which crashed on to the Moon\u2019s surface two days before Chandrayaan-3\u2019s landing, had cost 12.6bn roubles ($133m).",
      "Despite the low cost, scientists say India is punching much above its weight by aiming to do valuable work.",
      "Chandrayaan-1 was the first to confirm the presence of water in lunar soil and Mangalyaan carried a payload to study methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Images and data sent by Chandrayaan-3 are being looked at with great interest by space enthusiasts around the world.",
      "So how does India keep the costs so low?",
      "Retired civil servant Sisir Kumar Das, who looked after Isro\u2019s finances for more than two decades, says the frugality can be traced back to the 1960s, when scientists first pitched a space programme to the government.",

      "Mr Das says one of the main reasons why Isro\u2019s missions are so cheap is the fact that all its technology is home-grown and machines are manufactured in India.",
      "In 1974, after Delhi conducted its first nuclear test and the West imposed an embargo, banning transfer of technology to India, the restrictions were \u201cturned into a blessing in disguise\u201d for the space programme, he adds.",

      "\u201cFor Chandrayaan-1, the allocated budget was $89m and that was okay for the original configuration. But subsequently, it was decided that the spacecraft would carry a Moon impact probe which meant an additional 35kg.\u201d",
      "Scientists had two choices - use a heavier rocket to carry the mission, but that would cost more, or remove some of the hardware to lighten the load.",
      "\u201cWe chose the second option. We reduced the number of thrusters from 16 to eight and pressure tanks and batteries were reduced from two to one.\u201d",
      "Reducing the number of batteries, Mr Annadurai says, meant the launch had to take place before the end of 2008.",
      "\u201cThat would give the spacecraft two years while it went around the Moon without encountering a long solar eclipse, which would impact its ability to recharge. So we had to maintain a strict work schedule to meet the launch deadline.\u201d",
      "Mangalyaan cost so little, Mr Annadurai says, \u201cbecause we used most of the hardware we had already designed for Chandrayaan-2 after the second Moon mission got delayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Bagla says India\u2019s space programme coming at such low cost is \u201can amazing feat\u201d. But as India scales up, the cost could rise.",

      "So, when Chandrayaan-3 was launched, it orbited the Earth several times before it was sling-shot into the lunar orbit, where it went around the Moon a few times before landing. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s Luna-25 escaped the Earth\u2019s gravity quickly riding a powerful Soyuz rocket.",
      "\u201cWe used Mother Earth's gravity to nudge us to the Moon. It took us weeks and a lot of resourceful planning. Isro has mastered this and done it successfully so many times.\u201d",
      "But, Mr Bagla says, India has announced plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2040 and it would need a more powerful rocket to fly the astronauts there quicker.",
      "The government recently said work on this new rocket had already been approved and it would be ready by 2032. This Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) will be able to carry more weight but also cost more.",
      "Also, Mr Bagla says, India is in the process of opening up the space sector to private players and it\u2019s unlikely that costs will remain so low once that happens.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",
      "\u201cSo I am optimistic that we're going to see a little bit of progress, but I think it's going to take time.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 02:45:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Two UK-based Africans tell the BBC how they are digging deep into their culture to change home decor.",
    "story": [
      "After more than a decade as a lawyer at high-powered banking firms like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nigerian-British Kelechi Ejikeme left the corporate world to follow her passion for interior design.",
      "Her rug collection is inspired by Nigeria's diverse terrain - rolling hills, winding rivers, sprawling savannahs and dense forests, and reminds me of the view from planes.",
      "\"So, when you interpret that into a rug or a carpet, it\u2019s symbolic,\" she said when I met her at her stall at the Decorex interior design show held in London last month.",
      "\"It\u2019s like, every minute, this is what we're actually every day stepping on.\"",
      "Made from jute, a durable and eco-friendly material, each rug integrates these natural elements.",
      "Jute is typically cultivated locally for its edible leaves, not for fibre. It comes from the same plant used for ewedu soup, a staple in south-western Nigeria.",
      "To bring her vision to life, Ejikeme has her rugs produced in India and Nepal, where jute is more widely developed into a thriving industry.",
      "Also at the event was Amechi Mandi, a Cameroonian-Nigerian interior designer who won House & Garden magazine\u2019s Rising Star award in 2022.",
      "He was not showcasing any of his work but had just spoken in a side session about his transition from fashion to interior design.",
      "Mandi holds a degree in furniture and product design, but after working in the fashion industry and later at a design firm, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of genuine African-inspired interior textiles.",
      "Too often, he found, they relied on \"clich\u00e9d\", post-colonial motifs.",
      "This led him to explore his Cameroonian and Nigerian heritage, with a focus on pre-colonial traditions.",
      "Recognising the untapped potential of indigenous textiles fading from memory -especially with the rise of \"ankara\" wax prints, a European import that has come to symbolise African design - Mandi set out to revive these cultural elements.",
      "He began integrating traditional techniques and patterns into his designs, and his work now includes a popular collection of cushions and throws, as well as a successful wallpaper collaboration.",
      "\"People have told me, 'Oh, your work is not African,' because they want to see ankara prints. It's been so impressed in the minds,\" Mandi told me.",
      "\"I get inspiration from indigenous traditions and cultures, and then, I give it a more contemporary spin,\" he added.",
      "Listening to Mandi made me realise how much I, too, had come to associate modern African design with ankara fabrics.",
      "This textile has dominated African fashion and design, making its mark on global stages in recent decades.",
      "And so, as I wandered through the exhibition, it was easy to assume that African designs were absent from this notable gathering.",
      "When she first started, Ejikeme juggled both law and interior design, working in one during the week and the other on weekends. It did not take long for her to realise where her true passion lay.",
      "\"In one world, you\u2019re trying to contain your energy or yourself or your expression just so that you don\u2019t ruffle feathers, while in another world your energy, you can\u2019t even extinguish it,\" she said.",
      "Since making the leap to full-time design six years ago, she has tackled a variety of projects, from homes and workplaces to movie sets.",
      "Last year, she launched her own rug collection, adding a new dimension to her work from her Swallow and Tea studio.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really new thing and I\u2019ve only had two shows but so far I\u2019ve had mostly residential and retail buyers mainly from Europe probably because my first show was in Belgium. Decorex was my first UK show,\" Ejikeme said.",
      "Most of Mandi\u2019s customers are Europeans, a trend he attributes to a prevailing preference among many Africans for foreign products.",
      "\"Most Africans still prefer to buy a Gucci,\" he said.",
      "\"I do have a few Africans buying but they are not like everyday Africans. They were all people who were born and bred abroad and are deep into African heritage and culture.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi concur that interior design in Africa is still in its developmental stages.",
      "In contrast to fashion, which has long been a significant focus for Africans and has recently experienced remarkable growth, the field of African interior design is just starting to establish itself.",
      "Ejikeme reflected on her first independent project in 2013, which coincided with a new wave of Africans in London entering high-paying fields like investment banking.",
      "She aimed to create spaces that not only exuded luxury and comfort but also captured a sense of home for her African clients, reflecting their heritage in a meaningful way.",
      "\"I was stumped because I'm somebody who loves antiques. I love old design. When I was in design school in London, my favourite thing was history of design, like learning about all the different periods - Victorian, Edwardian, etc - and what distinguished one from the other.",
      "\"But there was no such thing in Africa. There's nothing like the history of African design because we haven't really kept that track,\" she said.",
      "This realisation motivated her to begin categorising African design periods to better understand and preserve the continent's design evolution, an ongoing project she began during her past 10 years living in Nigeria before returning to London last year.",
      "Ejikeme visited places like the Bogobiri art gallery in Lagos, which displayed a mixture of old sculpture and modern art.",
      "She also visited sellers in quiet corners of Nigerian markets, where she came across staffs of office used by Igbo elders in precolonial times. She began categorising these objects she came across according to their period in history, whether late 1990s or pre-colonial.",
      "She has not yet finished and wants to devote more time to it to use them in her interior design projects.",
      "Mandi believes that following trends in how we design our homes and other spaces was historically never an African thing, especially with the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "\"Traditionally, interiors have never been a priority. We have always been into functionality. We were more into decorating our exteriors, like painting the walls, painting the outside,\" he said.",
      "\"Each civilization has evolved, but we didn\u2019t have the chance to evolve because of the 400 years we were arrested with the transatlantic slave trade.\"",
      "He added that Africans were in \"constant flight\" during the slave trade, so \"how can you think, 'I have this house, I have to make the inside fine, let me put that bench, let me weave this cloth'? Our society didn't have the chance to evolve like that.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi noted that many wealthy and prominent Africans, from celebrities to entrepreneurs, often have interiors that lack a distinctly African identity.",
      "However, Ejikeme believes this is changing as more Africans gain disposable income, they are increasingly investing in decorating their homes in a way that tells their personal story and captures their experiences.",
      "\"If you have a product that can be made beautiful, and exquisite, and sort of memorable, that tells some kind of story or has some kind of meaning, it will appeal to Africans and other people that are not African,\" she says.",

    "summary": "Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will need to secure at least 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the 2024 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "Five presidents in U.S. history have won the presidency without winning the popular vote, and the most recent to do so was Donald Trump in 2016. His opponent that year, Hillary Clinton, won over 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide, but she lost enough key states to be defeated in the Electoral College, 306 to 232.",
      "Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College to Joe Biden in 2020. (Once again the electoral vote was 306 to 232, but this time in the Democrat's favor.) Trump is the GOP nominee again in the 2024 presidential election, in what's shaped up to be a tight race against Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Since its founding, the nation has used the Electoral College to elect the president. Read on to learn more about how it works, its history and what role individual voters play in the outcome of the presidential election.",
      "What is the Electoral College and how does it work?",
      "The Electoral College is the process by which Americans elect their president and vice president indirectly through their state's electors. Candidates must secure 270 electoral votes, a majority of the 538 at stake, in order to win the White House.",
      "Before the general election, states select slates of electors. After voters cast their ballots in November, the candidate who wins the popular vote determines which slate of electors \u2014 Republican, Democrat or a third party \u2014 will cast electoral votes in the Electoral College for the president.",
      "In most states, it's winner-take-all \u2014 whoever gets the most votes in the state wins all of its electoral votes.",
      "In Maine and Nebraska, the rules are slightly different. They have a proportional representation system in which the winner of each congressional district is awarded one electoral vote, and the winner of the statewide vote is awarded each state's remaining two electoral votes. Some Republicans were hoping to change Nebraska's rules to a winner-take-all model, since one of its electoral votes often goes to the Democrat, but the effort fell short.",
      "Electors meet in their respective states in mid-December to cast their votes for the president. The meeting takes place the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December, which falls on Dec. 17 this year.",
      "There is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged, though they almost always do. \"Faithless electors\" are rare, since the electors are selected by the parties.",
      "How many electors are in the Electoral College?",
      "There are 538 electors in total across the 50 states and Washington, D.C.",
      "What determines how many electoral votes a state gets?",
      "Each state is allocated electors based on the size of its congressional delegation. Several states with the smallest populations \u2014 Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming \u2014 have three electors each, since they have one representative in the House and two senators, while California, the largest, has 54 electoral votes.\u00a0 Washington, D.C., is also allocated three electors.",
      "States may gain or lose electors as the population shifts, and there have been a number of changes since the 2020 presidential election.",
      "In the redistricting that followed the 2020 Census, Texas gained two electoral votes and five states gained one each, while seven states lost one electoral vote.",
      "Who chooses the electors?",
      "The electors are chosen before the general election by their respective political party. Their sole purpose is to meet in their state following the November election and cast two votes \u2014 one for the president and one for the vice president.",
      "Who are the electors?",
      "Each party's slate of electors may include state and local elected officials, party leaders, community activists and others affiliated with the party. They are typically chosen \"to recognize their service and dedication to that political party,\" the National Archives\u00a0explains.",
      "There are no major qualifications, but members of Congress and certain other office-holders are barred from participating, along with anyone who has\u00a0engaged in insurrection or rebellion.",
      "What happens if there's a tie in the Electoral College?",
      "In the rare event that there's a tie in the Electoral College \u2014 which in the modern era would mean each candidate wins 269 electoral votes \u2014 members of the newly elected House of Representatives would decide the outcome of the presidential election, while the Senate would select the vice president.",
      "This type of contingent election would also take place if neither candidate wins a majority. This could occur if a third-party candidate wins some of the electoral votes or if there are a number of \"faithless electors\"\u00a0who break their pledge and vote for a candidate other than the one who won the state's popular vote.",
      "If it went to the House, each state would get a single vote, regardless of the size of its congressional delegation, and the 50 House delegations (the District of Columbia would not participate) would select one of the top three presidential candidates.",
      "The vice president would be selected by a simple majority in the Senate, and all senators would have a vote. As a result, it's possible that the president and vice president could be from different parties.",
      "Since the 12th Amendment was ratified in 1804, there have been contingent elections twice.",
      "In 1824, four presidential candidates split the vote, and no candidate won an electoral majority. John Quincy Adams won the election in the House, even though Andrew Jackson had won a plurality of the popular and electoral votes.",
      "And in 1837, Martin Van Buren won a majority of electoral votes, but Virginia's 23 electors refused to support his vice presidential candidate, Richard Johnson, and became faithless electors. That left Johnson one vote short, leading to a contingent election in the Senate, which he won easily.",
      "Why do we vote if the Electoral College picks the president?",
      "Five presidents in U.S. history have lost the popular vote and still managed to win the election, leading some to wonder why the nation continues to keep the Electoral College in place. The Electoral College was established in Article II of the Constitution and could be repealed by constitutional amendment. But that's a difficult road. Amendments require a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states, or 38 of the current 50.",
      "In a 2023 Pew Research poll, 65% of Americans said the president should be elected through the popular vote, not the Electoral College. Hundreds of proposals have been introduced in Congress to change the process over the years. There's also a multi-state effort called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which has been adopted by 17 states and Washington, D,C. That proposal would ensure that the winner of the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes in the states that signed the compact \u2014 but it would only go into effect if enough states agree.",
      "So why keep the Electoral College in place if there's so much frustration from Americans? According to the National Archives, the Founding Fathers saw the Electoral College as a middle ground between giving the decision to Congress or to a direct vote by citizens. Proponents say it keeps\u00a0less populous states\u00a0from being underrepresented by discouraging candidates from campaigning disproportionately in urban centers that are more heavily populated.",
      "What's the history of the Electoral College?",
      "The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College in the Constitution in 1787. The term \"Electoral College\" does not appear in the nation's historic document, but the word \"electors\" does,\u00a0the National Archives\u00a0noted.",
      "The ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804 changed some of the rules for the Electoral College. For example, it required separate electoral votes be cast for the president and vice president. With the ratification of\u00a0the 23rd Amendment\u00a0in 1961, the District of Columbia received three electors.",

Ultimately, the bottom line is that what this election is going to be about, when people go vote, they're not \u2013 they're going to be voting on three things that are critical to them. How much does it cost to live in this country, and can you afford the things that people work hard to be able to afford? Because over the last four years, they have not.",

And the answer is, no, people do not face \u2013 feel safe and secure, when you have dangerous criminal elements entering this country across the open border that Kamala Harris allowed.

We're edging closer every single month to some broader global conflict that could involve the United States. And guess who's going to have to go fight in those wars?

We saw problems earlier in the week in Pennsylvania, and they were resolved by a court, where people were not allowed \u2013 being allowed in one county from accessing their on-demand mail ballot at the spot. There are going to be issues like that.",
      "They're being confronted at the front end, and those things are being looked at. Look, in the state of Michigan, we know now \u2013 and this is not me making it up. I can't believe it hasn't received more coverage. A Chinese national registered to vote and voted. And now he's being charged for doing that. But guess what? His ballot is going to count.",
      "We know at least one noncitizen's ballot is going to count in Michigan because they don't know which ballot it is and they can't retrieve it. These are facts. Now, whether that's widespread or not, I hope not, but these are things that are happening, and they need to be watched at.",
      "As far as foreign adversaries, sure. I mean, Iran wants to kill Donald Trump. Iran \u2013 this has been fully documented. They are trying to kill Donald Trump. You talk about violent rhetoric.

      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to comment on what they access, but I agree with Mark Warner's statement.",
      "It is an egregious, outrageous and dangerous breach of our telecommunications systems across multiple companies. I will leave it at that. I think, as time goes on, we're going to learn more about it. Some of it will be made public. I think there's more that's still being gathered.",

      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, Margaret, I can tell you a couple of things.",
      "One, I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen, in this state. I am absolutely confident in our ground game, in our canvassing and knocking on doors and talking to our voters, because that's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them, because there's so much information out there.",
      "And now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about. So, yes, I am very, very confident.",
      "And the only other thing, let me say this, Margaret, is, you know, I was reelected just recently, and there was a Republican advantage in my race, in my midterm, and I won. Not only did I win. Our congressional delegation won. And so we also won our \u2013 our state seats in our state House.",
      "So what we know in Nevada, it is really about that organization. It's knocking on those doors. It's phone-banking. It's talking to our voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: We also have a large population of our voters who are nonpartisan. Over a third are nonpartisan. And those are the independents in other states, and they lean Democratic. They leaned my way.",
      "And so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you mentioned your victory in 2022. That was just by 8,000 votes. So this \u2013 this could be a tight one as well this time around.",
      "The Trump campaign talks about making inroads with the working-class population, in particular, on the issue of the economy. Your state has the second highest unemployment rate in the country. The majority of voters do not have a college degree.",
      "Why shouldn't the Trump campaign be confident that they are making inroads with this key demographic?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, a couple of things, Margaret. You talked about my \u2013 my tight race. They're always tight in Nevada. It's a swing state. They're always close. It's always within the margin.",
      "And that's why it is important you get out and talk to voters and you don't take anyone for granted. And you're right. A large part of our population, our service industry, those are high school-educated individuals. That's my family. They worked in this industry.",
      "And these are the individuals we want to talk to. But we also have been engaging them on the issues that matter to them. And if you look at our strong organized labor, which is the culinary, which is made up most of the service industry, along with our building trades, they're knocking on those doors in favor of the Democrats, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",
      "So there is this outright concerted effort by everyone to make sure our voters understand who is \u2013 what's at stake here. And there's a stark difference. I mean, you know, let me just say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: \u2026 because this is important for voters to know this, that Kamala Harris has already talked about, she wants to represent everyone. She wants to lift everybody up.",
      "No matter who voted for her, she's going to represent them. She's going to start day one with a to-do list to how she works on the issues that she knows that many voters are challenged with. Donald Trump is going to walk in the Oval Office with an enemies list. There's a difference between the two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And when you talk to voters about it who are expecting that in Nevada, in a swing state, that makes the difference in whether or not we are going to win. And we are going to win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does your party \u2013 we played what the current president, Joe Biden, said about Trump supporters, and some have compared that, Republicans have compared that to what Hillary Clinton said about a basket of deplorables.",
      "Does your party have a disdain problem in talking down to working class voters in particular?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, I can tell you here in Nevada in general \u2013 first of all, let's just say, but \u2013 we know this, that President Biden clarified his statement, and Kamala Harris has made it very clear she wants to represent everyone, no matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he quibbled about an apostrophe in the transcript.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: But \u2013 but Kamala Harris made it very clear moving forward that she wants to represent everyone, right, no matter whether you voted for her or not.",
      "And whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that. And she's made that very clear.",
      "What \u2013 what I hear from voters in Nevada \u2013 and this is where the \u2013 where it's relevant, not the spin rooms, not the polls, not what you're hearing on the national news, but what are voters saying, and what do they care about? And they're listening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And I can tell you, my voters in Nevada that I talk to, which is really a large population of not only our blue- collar, but minority Latinos, a \u2013 excuse me, Asian American Pacific Islanders, a vibrant Black community, Native Americans \u2013 they are listening to, what are the issues?",
      "Who's bringing the solutions, right? Who has the solutions to address the affordable housing issue? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Who has the issues to address how we lower health care costs and keep them low for all Americans? Kamala Harris. Who has the idea about how we protect the Affordable Care Act and not repeal it? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "So those conversations matter to my voters in Nevada, and that's what's relevant at the end of the day and how we're going to make this happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your state also will be key to watch. You do have abortion on the ballot.",

Before that we had disclosed that Russia was behind a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, fake video and one targeting voters in Georgia, falsely claiming that Haitian migrants were - were voting.",
      "How do these tactics that Russia is using now compare to what you saw in 2020 and back in 2016?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, they've evolved their techniques from generating and launching content from, for instance, St. Petersburg. That's what we saw in 2016. You had the internet research agency operating out of an office building, almost like, you know, a normal business.",
      "Over time, though, given the improvements in the intelligence community, cyber command, and our own awareness of the activities and what they're doing, they've started to push the boundaries out. And so they're actually generating content and then they're laundering it effectively through other platforms, like Telegram and even now what we're seeing is a significant amount of laundering through X.",
      "And then U.S. citizens pick up this information and pick up these videos, and then they promote it on their own accounts and on their own social media platforms, like Facebook. So, they are moving it out. They're avoiding the techniques that U.S. law enforcement intelligence has deployed and developed. And so they're not as good though. So, a lot of these videos that we're seeing, they're actually quite amateurish. That's not to say they can't have better content coming forward, but really they're just kind of flooding the zone and trying to distract.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And confuse and sow - and sow distrust of our institutions.",
      "Sam, U.S. intelligence has been briefing and disclosing. That's part of what they're doing to try to counteract this.",
      "We also saw early on warnings about Iran and what they are doing. The assessment Iran favors Harris, Russia favors Trump.",
      "What form of influence are we seeing?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Iran has two main goals in this election cycle. First, to denigrate President Trump. They have expressed present - excuse me, a preference for Vice president Harris based upon Trump's record in office and their perception of what Mr. Trump would do if elected. That's objective one.",
      "Objective two is to sow discord. And they view undermining perception about thein integrity of our election as an effective tool. So, they are using influence operations to denigrate Mr. Trump and to sow discord using AI- generated content really focused in particular on, for example, allegations of voter fraud. We should expect Iran to continue increasingly sophisticated influence operations related to perceptions of a lack of election integrity. That will last well after polls close, Margaret. This is the most attenuated election security related threat environment we have likely seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not about just changing votes. It's about not trusting our democracy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, 76 million Americans already voted. So, can we say those numbers show the adversaries are failing, or are the election workers you're speaking with really concerned about what's to come?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, it's - it has increased our ability to be resilient against the disinformation. The more people who vote early, they're effectively inoculated themselves against disinformation that might be inclined to be intended to help them self-suppress their vote or confuse them about how to vote. So, the fact that we've had over 76 million vote already, and that's going to increase by several million more once all the mail ballots are in, once there's even early voting going on today, still in about 27 states and D.C. So, that's very good. That means the number of people that still need to vote on Election Day, when disinformation might be very focused on them, trying to get them confused with very little time for them to be resilient against that disinformation, that's going to affect fewer voters. That's a very good thing. And I think we're seeing, especially in states like Georgia and North Carolina, well over 4 million votes in each of those states has been cast. Millions of votes in many other - of the swing states. And so far, very few problems despite efforts to create problems perhaps from our adversaries overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would point people to the secretaries of state themselves, their websites, for reliable information?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Yes. Whenever you need information, go to your state election website. That's usually the secretary of state's website. Sometimes, in North Carolina, Wisconsin, there's an election commission or an election board. Go to your local election website if you know your country or locality where elections are taking place. And if you need help, go to vote.gov. That will navigate you there eventually. Go - just rely upon those sources solely for information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, when you were in government, we did see, back in 2018, disclosure by the general at the head of then Cyber Command and the National Security Agency say that - that the government at that time set up a small group to basically knock Russia offline, to physically stop them from some of these influence operations.",
      "Can the U.S. undertake offensive operations like that now?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. I do think though that the infrastructure that the adversaries or the Russians and the Iran have put into place may not be where it once was. It has moved. Keep in mind that earlier this year the Department of Justice took offline a disinformation group that we track as Doppelganger, they took their various websites offline. And they did it in a way that was timed so that they could not rebuild those websites and reestablish the engagement with those websites in time for the election. So, there have been steps taken to ensure that the bad guys can't execute their strategies.",
      "And in the meantime, you have organizations, like SISA, that are doing more with more jurisdictions on election security than at any other point previously. So, they have a lot of confidence around the resilience of the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you said about using Americans to spread disinformation.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: People are becoming unwitting agents of a foreign adversary essentially by re-tweeting or reposting some of these fake videos.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: We have seen that, right? So, there was another Department of Justice announcement that a media outlet, based out of Tennessee, was receiving funding from the Russians, from RT, a cutout (ph) -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tenet Group.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Tenet Group.",
      "Now, to David's earlier point, that is why it is so critically important that American voters, when they're looking for information about the election, they go to their relevant local or state official. They know what's going on. Go - if you're in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger and Gabe Sterling are probably running the tightest ship when it comes to elections in the country right now. They're incredibly effective. They're out there. They're putting information in the hands of the American people so they understand what's happening.",
      "And so when Russian operations like the Haitian voters pops up, they were on it immediately and they knocked it down. That is hugely effective in maintaining trust of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, we have seen concerns about physical security, though, as well at voting locations. The Democratic governor of Washington state has activated the National Guard, put them on stand-by, citing general and specific information and concerns about violence and unrest. You did have that drop box in Vancouver that damaged hundreds of ballots. There was an incendiary device there. Are there specific plots the federal government knows of at this time?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, it is a generally heightened threat environment, both in terms of complexity and the length of time that terrorism related threats, criminal threats and influence operations by nation states will last related to the election. It is just prudent planning, Margaret, in this threat environment for officials at all levels of government, federal, state and local, to engage in detailed operational planning. State and local officials are in the lead for the security in their jurisdictions.",
      "Now, in my experience, particularly post January 6th, those operational plans must include a full sense of all available law enforcement resources. National Guard is the last resort. You have local resources, state resources and then, as necessary, National Guard, as well as a clear sense of who to call when so that there aren't communication failures.",
      "Federal officials have invested a lot of money and time in doing exercises, hundreds them with state and local officials, sharing intelligence and information, and trying to share best practices. But at the end of the day, the state and local officials are in the lead and should have clear operational plans for a range of scenarios that may arise, in particular large scale security incidents that may arise with little or no warning. We learned lessons from January 6th. And from my conversations with former colleagues, that operational planning has been underway for years, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I want to quickly get you to respond to what Senator Rubio was raising during our interview. He was talking about the charges brought by the secretary - or I mentioned the charged brought by the secretary of state against the individual he highlighted had cast a vote despite not being a citizen.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How is it that someone who's not a citizen could register and cast a ballot? How did that even happen?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, we have several protections in place to make sure it's very, very unlikely this is going to happen. We've seen places like Ohio, which has documented only six cases of non-citizen voting over a decade, dating back to 2014. We have places like Georgia, that has documented nine cases of non-citizen voting since 2008. So, it does happen, but it's extremely rare. And I'm sure Michigan is going to go through the process of evaluating exactly what went wrong in this one particular instance.",
      "But it's also important to note, this is one case. It was very swiftly dealt with. This individual is going to lose his administration at the University of Michigan. He's going to be prosecuted. He might go to jail. And he's almost certainly to be deported.",
      "This is a cautionary tale. It's one of the reasons we know that non-citizen voting is extremely rare. It's not zero, but it's very close to zero because the potential benefit to the person who perpetrates that crime, one vote in an election with 160 million ballots is far outweighed by the potential risk that they're facing of deportation and other jail time, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that.",
      "I wanted you to explain the process, because I think explaining how our courts work -",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How the systems are set up to deal with these things is important.",
      "One of the things disclosed in the U.S. intelligence report put out by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was that Russia's amplifying these claims of non-citizen voting.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what happens.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right. That's what happens. And there are plenty of protections in place to make sure that this is extremely rare. As close to zero as it can be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. Thanks for your perspective. I know we'll keep you on speed dial throughout the week.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To dissect some of the new economic indicators we've been seeing, we're joined by Mohamed El-Erian. He is the chief economic adviser at Allianz.",
      "Welcome back to the program.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: (Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, we saw on Friday this jobs report that indicated job creation stalled a bit in October. There were some complicating factors, like hurricanes and a strike at Boeing. But what's your perspective on what this indicates for the next president of the United States?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, most of the report, as you pointed out, was distorted in a really important manner by the strikes by the hurricanes. The bottom line, Margaret, is we have an economy that has been growing robustly. Inflation is coming down. And the main challenge for the next administration is not just to maintain what is called economic exceptionalism, because we're outperforming all other advanced economies, but also to continue to reposition it for the engines of tomorrow's prosperity. And that's absolutely critical.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the Federal Reserve is meeting later this week, may move on interest rates again since inflation is around or getting close to that 2 percent target. But for average people, they see housing prices are high, they see grocery prices are still high. Where's the scenario where those prices actually come down?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and that's what everybody's expecting, but it's not going to happen.",
      "Look, the good news is interest rates will continue to come down. The good news is inflation, which is the rate of increase of the cost of living will come down. But it's very hard to bring down prices. And that's one political problem is, when you tell people inflation is coming down, in their head they think prices are coming down, not the rate of increase of prices. So, it's a misunderstanding, unfortunately. But you've to be careful what you wish for, because if prices come down significantly, we are then in something much worse economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that misunderstanding being used quite a lot on the campaign trail, Mohamed, as you know.",
      "I know the stock market is not an indicator of what's happening with the economy, but it is forward-looking. This week what should we be expecting as a reaction to the outcome of this election?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, believe it or not, a lot of investors are just on the sideline. They see so many possibilities, be it for the presidential race, be it for Congress, or even the extent to which what is promised by presidential candidates will become policy. There stands to be a big gap between the two. So, quite a few investors have said, you know what, there's way too much uncertainty. I'm just standing on the sideline and waiting to see what emerges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A gap between what's promised and what's delivered is a very diplomatic way of putting campaigning there, Mohamed. But neither candidate is even making a gesture towards reducing the debt burden in this country. And in terms of what's being promised, the plans that the vice president has put forward is estimated by this Committee for a Responsible Budget to increase the federal debt by nearly $4 trillion through 2035. Donald Trump's plans would increase it by nearly $8 trillion.",
      "Congress, as you suggested there, they can put the brakes on anything here. But does this continued promise of spending and no promise of reducing it concern you?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It does. It does in a big way.",
      "Look, it was unthinkable that we would have almost 30 months of unemployment at 4 percent or below and we'd run fiscal deficit of six to eight percent. Remember, John Kennedy said, when the sun is shining you fix the roof. Instead, the sun has been shining on our economy and we've created more roofs. Our debt to GDP is 120 percent of - our debt is 120 percent of GDP.",
      "Look, both candidates, whether they like it or not, are going to have to find a way to moderate deficits and debt and critically, Margaret, to create operational flexibility in the budget. The budget is becoming more and more rigid, which means that it's harder to respond to unanticipated shocks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unanticipated shocks.",
      "In terms of one of the things that we have heard from the Trump campaign quite a lot is this pledge to use tariffs to create income for the government somehow. That's how Donald Trump suggests using them.",
      "Do you view tariffs as a regressive tax that will hurt poor people by raising prices for them, or do you view them as somehow, you know, a rising tide that floats all boats?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, tariffs are a dangerous tool. They have limited use, but if they are overused, they become counterproductive. It is - it is not a good idea to promise the use of tariffs to deliver all sorts of things. Be it a lower deficit, be it protecting domestic producers, be it putting pressure, leveraging influence on other countries. Tariffs have a role to play, but not to the extent - and similar for the other side. Industrial policy and regulation, they both have a role to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: But be careful of overreach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Fair point.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now for a preview of what we'll all be looking for on Tuesday is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, this is neck-and-neck. You've been telling us that for weeks now. What is it that the campaigns are focusing on and what we should be looking for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Hey there, Margaret. So, start with this. Here is the map. The states in white are all those razor-tight battleground states. But let's get beyond the margin of error for a second and look at some of the political possibilities. And we can show you that in our polling models.",
      "Start with this, what I think is one of the key dynamics in this race. There are voters who say they did not vote in 2020 and many of them, in fact about four in ten, say that they definitely will this time. Among them, especially the men among them, are for Donald Trump. And the Trump campaign is trying to turn them out.",
      "So, we wondered, what happens if he does? And I'll show you. On this map we're going to run that scenario through our CBS models. And if he does turn out a lot of those non-voters, those men, they boost him, he would do well across the sun belt, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and flip Pennsylvania, and that would be enough to put him over the top and give him the win. That's a hypothetical, but it shows you how one of those campaign dynamics could play out.",
      "Now, on the other side, there's another important dynamic, and that is the gender gap. We've talked about it a lot. And I'll show you a slide from one of our recent polls that illustrate that. So many more women voting for Kamala Harris.",
      "Well, you've seen the Harris campaign out there trying not only to get women turnout, but also some crossover from Republicans, and in particular Republican women. So, we said, what happens if she can get those Republican numbers to match closer to what Joe Biden got in 2020, driven in large part by women and Republican women. If I put that scenario into the map here, our models show that she would hold the blue wall states across the upper Midwest, keep Georgia in her column, even flip North Carolina, and that would give her an Electoral College victory.",
      "All of this, again, hypothetical. But it puts it in political terms, some of the dynamics that could play out, and we'll be watching, on election night, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll be watching in real time as the data comes in to the desk.",
      "What is it that we should be tracking throughout the night?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, we're going to show you everything as it comes in. And the first thing I'm going to show you is where the votes are, because sometimes, and I'll pull up the 2020 map here in Georgia just as an example, you're going to see red areas, Republican, you're going to see blue areas, Democratic. But I'm always going to show, there are more people in some of these place than others. If I take this map and I rotate it, you'll - what you'll see in the example of Georgia is, the higher bars reflect more votes, and there's more voters in Atlanta and metro Atlanta. And Democrats need to do well in places like that. Really get a lot of turnout there. Whereas across rural areas, you see it's more flat on the map here. Not as many votes but Republicans very consistently kind of add to their margins there. That's one way we're going to show you the state in full.",
      "The other thing I'm going to watch is patterns, shifts from the last election to this one. Again, as an example, if I were to show you the shift that happened from 2016 to 2020, in Georgia, Democrats, Joe Biden at the time, got a lot of those counties around metro Atlanta shifting blue, those rural areas shifted red, Republicans. We'll see if something like that happens again. So it's where the votes come from, how they shift and the last thing, very quickly, Margaret, I'll remind everybody is, patience. If I were to take that same Georgia timeline and show you what it looked like at say 9:00 p.m., just after poll closed, a couple hours, you see so much uncounted votes still in Georgia, Metro Atlanta hadn't counted yet, et cetera. If this pattern comes out again on election night, we'll want to say, hold on, let's wait for all the votes to get counted before we know the winner.",

      "Around half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, with Republicans leading statewide, spurring anxiety among Democrats heading into Election Day. Nevada is also the only state where Republicans flipped the governor's mansion in 2022, although Cortez Masto hung onto her seat by less than 8,000 votes in that same election. But Cortez Masto said she's \"optimistic\" about Harris' chances in the Silver State, citing what she has seen as an impressive ground game and canvassing efforts from Democrats.",
      "\"That's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them,\" Cortez Masto said. \"Now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about.\"",
      "With an economy based largely around tourism and hospitality in Las Vegas, Nevada is home to a significant working class population. The Trump campaign has worked to make inroads among the voting bloc with economic policies that may be especially salient in Nevada, where the economy was among the most impacted by pandemic closures in 2020, spurring frustration with Democrat-led policies.",
      "Cortez Masto said Democrats are engaging with the working-class communities \"on the issues that matter to them,\" while touting support from organized labor. And she argued that Harris is the candidate with solutions for affordable housing and lowering health care costs, among other issues.",
      "\"That's what's relevant at the end of the day, and how we're going to make this happen,\" she said.",
      "Still, the Nevada Democrat urged that elections are \"always close\" in Nevada. And she noted that she won reelection in 2022 facing a Republican advantage \u2014 in what was the closest Senate race in the country in the midterms.",

      "A Republican presidential candidate hasn't won Nevada since 2004, but Democrats' margin of victory has decreased in recent years.",
      "Cortez Masto also defended President Biden after he appeared to call supporters of former President Donald Trump \"garbage,\" saying that he had clarified the remarks as being about a comedian's rhetoric at a Trump rally. And she argued that Harris, whom she worked with when they were both state attorneys general, has \"made it very clear, moving forward, that she wants to represent everyone.\"",
      "\"No matter whether you voted for her or not, and whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that,\" Cortez Masto added.",

Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, downplayed Trump's connection to the comedian's remarks, while arguing that \"what's more relevant\" is Mr. Biden's comment, which he argued is in line with \"what most people in the Democratic Party and hierarchy believe.\"",

Under the proposed change to the state's constitution, the state would not be able to \"interfere with this fundamental right before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible.\" Fetal viability is generally understood to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, and is defined in the ballot measure as the point when \"the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus,\" as determined by a healthcare professional.",

      "Let's face it: this presidential campaign is not gonna win any awards for civility. Policy proposals aside, there's been name-calling, vulgarity, and plain old meanness. And at times, it can seem like the rudeness of our politics has infected our personal interactions as well.",
      "How did we get here? And, on the eve of this election, what can we do about it?",
      "Well, to start, consider something simple: tone of voice.",
      "No, this is not a panacea for all our social and political ills. But this secret weapon for civility is biologically hardwired.",
      "Want proof? Babies and toddlers react in predictable ways to both the tone of someone's voice and the expression on their face. Children learn to trust certain voices, even before they can understand the meaning of words. And chances are, an angry, loud voice will elicit fear and the very opposite of trust. \u00a0 Those deeply-ingrained responses follow us through life, and can help or hinder our interactions with others.",
      "If we really want to have conversations instead of dueling monologues, we need to be genuinely curious about what the other person has to say. And if the way we communicate \u2013 not just the words but the way we say them \u2013 triggers mistrust, there's little hope for a meaningful exchange of ideas. \u00a0 Let's be clear: a mean thing said nicely is still mean. And there are times when a warm and compassionate tone will do you little good: for instance, arguments with people who disregard facts.",
      "But for all those other times, consider taking a lesson from children. The next time you strike up a conversation with somebody who has an opposing view, try using a kind and gentle tone. It will signal that you are genuinely interested in hearing what they have to say. You might not reach a meeting of the minds, but look at the face: instead of a scowl, you just may see a smile.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 09:56:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The Colonial Era living history museum in Williamsburg, Virginia, offers an enlightening portrait of life in Revolutionary-era America, while providing a vivid contrast to today's political and social conflicts.",
    "story": [
      "Colonial Williamsburg, capital of the British colony of Virginia, has been preserved as a sprawling museum. Its mission: that \"the future may learn from the past.\"",
      "The crown jewels of Williamsburg, Virginia, are the interpreters, interacting with audiences of our day, but in the context of the world as they would have known it in their time.",
      "By way of example, Thomas Jefferson welcomes visitors: \"Good day, friends. How are you faring? You have no complaints? You must not be Virginians! If not from Virginia, where from? Pennsylvania, land of religious anarchy? Welcome! The Ohio Territories? From terra incognito. Welcome to civilization! Upper Canada? Bonjour! Are you immigrating here? Oh, you should. We are trying to encourage immigrants to immigrate here.\"",
      "Indeed, immigration was highly controversial in Jefferson's time, but from a radically different perspective than ours. I raised the issue with Kurt Smith (who personifies Thomas Jefferson), and Katherine Pittman (a very feisty Martha Washington).",
      "\"It was there in 1776,\" said Smith, \"in the Declaration of Independence. You know that middle bit that everyone skips? In the 27 long train of abuses, Jefferson says, 'He [the king] has prevented immigration.' It is one of the reasons we declare independence.\"",
      "Pittman asked, \"And how can we improve if we never welcome anything new?\"",
      "\"We're not talking about 'never' welcoming anything new,\" Koppel said. \"We need to know who's coming. We need to know whether they are people of good character. Isn't that what the argument is about?\"",
      "\"It's the argument in your time,\" Pittman said. \"We can just speak to our time.\"",
      "\"Oh, cut it out!\"",
      "\"You started it!\" Pittman laughed.",
      "\"I'm in a pissing match with Mrs. Washington, for God's sake!\" said Koppel.",
      "\"I think I'm gonna win!\" she laughed.",
      "The interpreters are well advised to merely hint at the issues of our day. Jefferson (Smith) opined, \"How do you get a body of men to vote for something because it's the right thing to do? I don't know. Maybe your politicians do it all the time!\" The audience was amused.",
      "Visitors to Williamsburg are left to grapple with the actual political problems of 2024. One woman remarked, \"There are certain people that want all the power, like the king. They wanted the power over everybody, and I think that's what's happening now.\"",
      "One young woman said, \"This country is steeped in conflict and a fight for liberty. But I truly hope I get to live in a world where I have rights to my body.\"",
      "\"Abortion,\" asked Koppel. \"You feel strongly about that?\"",
      "\"I do,\" she replied.",
      "It's a subject on which Martha Washington also has her own views on, c. 1800. In that era, she said, the issue was dealt with from within the home: \"Birth and a woman's health is a woman's sphere,\" she said. \"One does not need to ascertain the services of a midwife if that is the course that you are wishing. These remedies are known amongst female kind. It is known in the indigenous communities. It is known in the African culture. It is known in our European cultures as well, be it different herbs, be it different techniques, in order to rid one's self of an unwanted child. But generally, they are held within the female sex. But I know that my husband, General Washington, would be in full support of whatever I wanted to do with my own person.\"",
      "An even more contentious issue, then and now, was race. In Jefferson's day, that meant slavery. Despite owning more than 600 enslaved men, women and children, Jefferson put forward legislation in 1779 to end the practice. \"But here's the problem,\" Jefferson said. \"Bill 51, making the slave trade illegal, has to be presented to a body of men, all of whom own \u2026 what?\"",
      "Williamsburg chooses to depict slavery in a particularly dramatic, and unrepresentative, fashion, in the person of James Lafayette, an enslaved man who was directed to meet with the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who served the American cause (and whose name James would ultimately adopt).",
      "Lafayette asked James to sneak across the British lines as a fake runaway slave, to ingratiate himself with the officers of the British army, and then report back what he heard. James succeeded so brilliantly that he eventually worked directly under General Lord Cornwallis. \"I could take that British intelligence and information and share it with the American side over and over again, which I did,\" James said.",
      "He faithfully served the American cause, but he said, \"I was not to be given my freedom for what I had done for American independence. I was sent back to slavery. I was sent back to Master William for six more years.\"",
      "Only after the Marquis de Lafayette petitioned the Virginia legislature for his freedom would it eventually be granted.",
      "Given that extraordinary backstory, I wondered how Stephen Seals (who interprets James) deals with taking on that role. \"You understand that so many of the issues that we deal with today are connected to many of the decisions that were made in the colonial area,\" Seals said. \"You can see the line from one to the other. And when you come to terms and you see that, I got very depressed, and I almost left. I almost quit.\"",
      "Then, a colleague reminded him he was giving a voice to ancestors denied one during their own lifetimes. \"And the moment she said that to me, I had few issues with the fact that I had to play an enslaved person every single day, because I now understood why I was doing it,\" he said. \"So, I love what I do, it's an honor doing what I do, but I live out in the middle of nowhere for a reason, because when I'm done here, I want to go and be away from it all. It's how I cope.\"",
      "Finally, there's the father of our nation, George Washington. \"When we began, I mentioned that we should avoid seeing factions arise,\" he said. \"I specifically mentioned by regional distinction, but it is just as important that we endeavor to avoid seeing factions arise by the spirit and fury of party politics.\"",
      "Asked by a visitor whom he would support in the 2024 presidential race, Washington replied, \"I'm not sure what you mean by presidential race, sir. Do you mean the election? Race? Can you imagine how lacking of any sort of virtue or dignity a race would have? We stand for elections, sir; we certainly don't run for it!\"",
      "Ron Carnegie gives a striking portrayal of the man who could have been president for life, but chose a different path. \"Very often when I'm talking to people at the end, somebody in that group will say, 'I wish President Washington was running today,'\" Carnegie said. \"There's no way a man like President Washington could be president today.\"",
      "Because? \"He is aloof, he's not friendly, he's not outgoing, he doesn't like to talk in public. And he doesn't want the job. And how are you gonna become President today if you don't want the job?\"",
      "That wasn't a problem in 1800. John Adams very much wanted to keep the job; Thomas Jefferson wanted to take it.",
      "Smith noted, \"Things are just as nasty in the 18th century as they are in the 21st. There are newspapers that called John Adams pretty awful things. And there were terrible things thrown in Jefferson's corner. There were New Englanders and New England newspapers that were certain that if Jefferson was elected president, he would personally go into their homes and steal their Bibles.\"",
      "John Adams lost that election, and conceded. \"Jefferson calls that election of 1800 the Second American Revolution,\" said Smith. \"And it was precisely because, for the first time in this country, there was a change in political party at the very top of government, and it was peaceful. It was a peaceful transfer of power. That's powerful.\"",
      "That had never happened before, but it set a precedent that lasted \u2013 until our time.",

    "summary": "Run for Recovery, a new program, offers a boot camp for people in recovery from substance use who dream of holding political office.",
    "story": [
      "Thomas Higdon was a politics fanatic his entire life: He kept up on the news cycle, he door-knocked for candidates, and he volunteered for a number of campaigns.",
      "He long dreamed of working in government, but he and everyone around him felt it wouldn't be possible because of his substance use. His use of alcohol and other drugs began causing problems when he was in law school in the mid-1990s, and in 2014, the consequences of his substance use left him living under an overpass. He is now abstinent from the drugs, but even years later, he felt he had ruined his chances of running for office.",
      "\"I allowed this internalized stigma, over decades, to blind me to what I could really do,\" Higdon, now 52, told CBS News.",
      "That thought stayed with him for years. He moved into grassroots organizing and advocacy spaces, but in 2023, he learned about the Recovery Advocacy Project's upcoming \"Run for Recovery\" program \u2014 and realized that working in public office might still be possible.",
      "Building a political bootcamp for people in recovery",
      "Courtney Gary-Allen, who began using drugs at a young age and overdosed multiple times before getting sober in 2015, has successfully run for office twice. In 2020, she was elected to the position of at-large City Councilor in Augusta, Maine. She was reelected to the same role in 2023. Both times, she won in a landslide, but the experience made her realize the need for a campaign bootcamp centered around people in recovery. Similar bootcamps are conducted by major political parties, but she wanted to create a bipartisan space tailored to the recovery community's specific experiences and needs.",
      "\"For the last decade or so, the recovery movement in America has been very focused on telling our stories and advocating and pushing for better policy around substance use disorder and recovery efforts, and I think this is a new chapter in the story of the recovery advocacy movement,\" said Gary-Allen, who is also the organizing director at the Maine Advocacy Recovery Project. \"We're no longer just advocating to policymakers. We are running for office to become the policymakers that are making decisions around these issues and many more.\"",
      "From that idea, Run for Recovery was born. The program graduated its inaugural class, made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents, in August 2024. The 15 participants were selected from across the country. Once a month for a year, they met online to talk the ins and outs of mounting a campaign. Lessons ranged from learning about finance laws to drafting position statements to preparing to talk openly about their substance abuse.",
      "Higdon was one of the selected participants. Even though he had \"been around campaigns all (his) life,\" he said the Run for Recovery class educated him about the technicalities of running for office. But it wasn't just the classroom learning that inspired him. When he started the class, \"there was still that sort of nagging voice in the back of your head of 'You can't run,'\" Higdon said. The time with his classmates helped change his perspective.",
      "\"I just can't express how good it felt to be around people who also wanted to do this thing,\" Higdon said. \"There are a number of reasons why I ultimately may not run, but fear of what people will say and that stigma won't be one of them.\"",
      "Mobilize Recovery founder Ryan Hampton, who completed the Run for Recovery program and is campaigning for a seat in Nevada's state assembly, said that stigma has affected his campaign. He said his campaign has been subject to attack ads bringing up his history of substance use and calling his policy positions to a \"dangerous drug agenda.\"",
      "It's a stressful time, Hampton said, but lessons he's learned throughout his recovery journey and from the Run for Recovery program have helped him continue his campaign.",
      "\"I am certainly the underdog in this race, but I'm used to it,\" Hampton said. \"Am I afraid of losing an election? No, I have lost a lot more in my life than an election. I am not afraid of losing. I'm running to win, but I'm also running because I believe our community is yearning for something different.\"",
      "Growing a movement",
      "There's no compiled list of every single person in recovery running for office. Gary-Allen said she was aware of several people in recovery running for office in Maine. Higdon is weighing a run for a seat in Maryland's state legislature. Racquel Garcia, a Run for Recovery graduate who holds an appointed position in Colorado, is considering a campaign for a state position in 2026.",
      "Gary-Allen said she hopes to see more of the Run for Recovery program graduates start their own campaigns \u2014 and see others in recovery, even people who didn't go through the program, make the jump into politics.",
      "\"I think we're on this cusp of a revelation. Not only are people in recovery voting and showing up and advocating, we're running for office, and we're going to serve in these seats,\" Gary-Allen said. \"We're going to help create solutions to substance use across the country.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "South Carolina put Richard Moore to death by lethal injection Friday for the 1999 fatal shooting of a convenience store clerk, despite a broad appeal for mercy by parties that included three jurors and the judge from his trial, a former prison director, pastors and the his family.",
      "Moore, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:24 p.m.",
      "TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE'S LAWYER SAYS 'THERE WAS NO CRIME' AS SHE MAKES LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE HIS LIFE",
      "Moore was convicted of killing the Spartanburg convivence store clerk in September 1999 and sentenced to death two years later. Moore went into the store unarmed, took a gun from the victim when it was pointed at him and fatally shot him in the chest as the victim shot him with a second gun in the arm.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers asked Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole because of his spotless prison record and willingness to be a mentor to other inmates. They also said it would be unjust to execute someone for what could be considered self-defense and unfair that Moore, who is Black, was the only inmate on the state\u2019s death row convicted by a jury without any African Americans.",
      "But McMaster refused to grant clemency. No South Carolina governor has reduced a death sentence, and 45 executions have now been carried out since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restart executions nearly 50 years ago.",
      "This photo provided by Justice 360 shows death row inmate Richard Moore at Kirkland Reception and Evaluation Center in Columbia, S.C., Aug. 17, 2018.\u00a0 (Justice 360 via AP)",
      "Unlike in previous executions, the curtain to the death chamber was open when media witnesses arrived. Moore's last words had already been read by Lindsey Vann, his lawyer of 10 years.",
      "Moore had his eyes closed and his head was pointed toward the ceiling. A prison employee announced the execution could begin at 6:01 p.m. Moore took several deep breaths that sounded like snores over the next minute. Then he took some shallow breaths until about 6:04, when his breathing stopped. Moore showed no obvious signs of discomfort.",
      "Vann cried as the employee announced the execution could start. She clutched a prayer bracelet with a cross. Sitting beside her was a spiritual advisor, his hands on his knees palms up. Vann clutched a prayer bracelet with a cross.",
      "Two members of the victims' family were also present, along with Solicitor Barry Barnette, who was on the prosecution team that convicted Moore. They all watched stoically.",
      "Afterward prison spokeswoman Chrysti Shain read his last words at a news conference.",
      "\"To the family of Mr. James Mahoney, I am deeply sorry for the pain and sorrow I caused you all,\" he said. \"To my children and granddaughters, I love you and am so proud of you. Thank you for the joy you have brought to my life. To all of my family and friends, new and old, thank you for your love and support.\"",
      "His final meal was steak cooked medium, fried catfish and shrimp, scalloped potatoes, green peas, broccoli with cheese, sweet potato pie, German chocolate cake and grape juice.",
      "Three jurors who condemned Moore to death in 2001, including one who wrote Friday, sent letters asking McMaster to change his sentence to life without parole. They were joined by a former state prison director, Moore's trial judge, his son and daughter, a half-dozen childhood friends and several pastors.",
      "They all said Moore, 59, was a changed man who loved God, doted on his new grandchildren the best he could, helped guards keep the peace and mentored other prisoners after his addiction to drugs clouded his judgment and led to the shootout in which James Mahoney was killed, according to the clemency petition.",
      "Moore previously had two execution dates postponed as the state sorted through issues that created a 13-year pause in the death penalty, including companies' refusal to sell the state lethal injection drugs, a hurdle that was solved by passing a secrecy law.",
      "Moore is the second inmate executed in South Carolina since it resumed executions. Four more are out of appeals and the state appears ready to put them to death in five-week intervals through the spring. There are now 30 people on death row.",
      "The governor said before the execution that he would carefully reviewing everything sent by Moore's lawyers and, as is customary, would wait until minutes before the execution starts to announce his decision once he hears by phone that all appeals are finished.",
      "\"Clemency is a matter of grace, a matter of mercy. There is no standard. There is no real law on it,\" McMaster told reporters Thursday.",
      "In an interview for a video that accompanied his clemency petition, Moore expressed remorse for the killing of Mahoney.",
      "\"This is definitely part of my life I wish I could change. I took a life. I took someone\u2019s life. I broke the family of the deceased,\" Moore said. \"I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\"",
      "Prosecutors and Mahoney's relatives have not spoken publicly in the weeks leading up to the execution. In the past, family members have said they suffered deeply and want justice to be served.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers said his original attorneys did not analyze the crime scene carefully and left unchallenged prosecutors' contention that Moore, who came into the store unarmed, fired at a customer and that his intention from the start was a robbery.",
      "According to their account, the clerk pulled a gun on Moore after the two argued because he was 12 cents short for what he wanted to buy.",
      "Moore said he wrestled the gun from Mahoney's hand and the clerk pulled a second weapon. Moore was shot in the arm and fired back, hitting Mahoney in the chest. Moore then went behind the counter and stole about $1,400.",
      "No one else on South Carolina\u2019s death row started their crime unarmed and with no intention to kill, Moore\u2019s current attorneys say.",
      "Jon Ozmint, a former prosecutor who was director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections from 2003 to 2011 and who added his voice to those seeking clemency, said Moore's case was not the worst-of-the-worst kind of crime that would usually prompt a death penalty case.",
      "There are plenty of people who were not sentenced to death but committed much more heinous crimes, Ozmint said, citing the example of Todd Kohlhepp, who was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to killing seven people including a woman he raped and tortured for days.",
      "Lawyers for Moore, who is Black, also said his trial was not fair. There were no African Americans on the jury even though 20% of Spartanburg County residents were Black.",

    "title": "Quincy Jones, Music Icon Who Worked With Frank Sinatra And Michael Jackson, Dead At 91",
    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 02:53:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The multi-talented music titan was one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassed an extraordinary musical catalog.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson\u2019s historic \u201cThriller\u201d album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Bill Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \u201cWe Are the World\u201d and was among the featured singers, would call Jones \u201cthe master orchestrator.\u201d",
      "In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2019Til You Get Enough,\u201d Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles\u2019 \u201cGreatest Hits 1971-1975\u201d among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\u201cIf an album doesn\u2019t do well, everyone says \u2018it was the producers fault\u2019; so if it does well, it should be your \u2018fault,\u2019 too,\u201d Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \u201cThe tracks don\u2019t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\u201d",
      "Quincy Jones leaves behind a vast music (\u201cThriller\u201d) & film (THE COLOR PURPLE) legacy. He was a terrific movie producer, composer, arranger & the most successful music producer of all time. He was also a compelling storyteller, recounting his projects\u2019 histories. #RIPQuincyJones pic.twitter.com/9Geqa1H1nG",
      "RIP Quincy Jones, who defined the highest level of musical genius for 5 generations. Perhaps the greatest producer & soundtrack composer of all-time. The most quotable, the coolest, who made everything from Thriller to Vibe to the Fresh Prince. Who did it all, better than anyone. pic.twitter.com/gU8PD1gsCN",
      "So sad to wake up to the news that music god & genius Quincy Jones has died\ud83d\ude22His work on Off the Wall with Michael Jackson was the first album to blow my mind, then Thriller. His catalogue of work is crazy. Love this Mack the Knife clip of him with Sinatra. Rest in power sir\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u263a\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/z4lPL57vFt",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\u201d and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\u201cThey nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\u201d he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early \u201960s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986. (But, to his great disappointment, no wins). In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\u201cMy philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\u201d Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra\u2019s \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles\u2019 soulful \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \u201cWe are the World\u201d alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson \u2013 \u201cP.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing\u201d \u2013 and Donna Summer \u2013 \u201cLove Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) \u2013 and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \u201cSanford and Son.\u201d",
      "Jones was a facilitator and maker of the stars. He gave Will Smith a key break in the hit TV show \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d which Jones produced, and through \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d he introduced Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg to filmgoers. Starting in the 1960s, he composed more than 35 film scores, including for \u201cThe Pawnbroker,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d",
      "He called scoring \u201ca multifaceted process, an abstract combination of science and soul.\u201d",
      "Jones\u2019 work on the soundtrack for \u201cThe Wiz\u201d led to his partnership with Jackson, who starred in the 1978 movie. In an essay published in Time magazine after Jackson\u2019s death, in 2009, Jones remembered that the singer kept slips of paper on him that contained thoughts by famous thinkers. When Jones asked about the origins of one passage, Jackson answered \u201cSocrates,\u201d but pronounced it \u201cSO-crayts.\u201d Jones corrected him, \u201cMichael, it\u2019s SOCK-ra-tees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd the look he gave me then, it just prompted me to say, because I\u2019d been impressed by all the things I saw in him during the rehearsal process, \u2018I would love to take a shot at producing your album,\u2019\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cAnd he went back and told the people at Epic Records, and they said, `No way \u2014 Quincy\u2019s too jazzy.\u2019 Michael was persistent, and he and his managers went back and said, `Quincy\u2019s producing the album.\u2019 And we proceeded to make \u2018Off the Wall.\u2019 Ironically, that was one of the biggest Black-selling albums at the time, and that album saved all the jobs of the people saying I was the wrong guy. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d",
      "Tensions emerged after Jackson\u2019s death. In 2013, Jones sued Jackson\u2019s estate, claiming he was owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the superstar\u2019s greatest hits. In a 2018 interview with New York magazine, he called Jackson \u201cas Machiavellian as they come\u201d and alleged that he lifted material from others.",
      "Jones was hooked on work and play, and at times suffered for it. He nearly died from a brain aneurysm in 1974 and became deeply depressed in the 1980s after \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d was snubbed by Academy Awards voters; he never received a competitive Oscar. A father of seven children by five mothers, Jones described himself as a \u201cdog\u201d who had countless lovers around the world. He was married three times, his wives including the actor Peggy Lipton.",
      "\u201cTo me, loving a woman is one of the most natural, blissful, life-enhancing \u2014 and dare I say, religious \u2014 acts in the world,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He was not an activist in his early years, but changed after attending the 1968 funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and later befriending the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jones was dedicated to philanthropy, saying \u201cthe best and only useful aspect of fame and celebrity is having a platform to help others.\u201d",
      "His causes included fighting HIV and AIDS, educating children and providing for the poor around the world. He founded the Quincy Jones Listen Up! Foundation to connect young people with music, culture and technology, and said he was driven throughout his life \u201cby a spirit of adventure and a criminal level of optimism.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife is like a dream, the Spanish poet and philosopher Federico Garcia Lorca said,\u201d Jones wrote in his memoir. \u201cMine\u2019s been in Technicolor, with full Dolby sound through THX amplification before they knew what these systems were.\u201d",
      "Along with Rashida, Jones is survived by daughters Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

    "summary": "The \"Real Time\" host argued that the gun-filled fantasy the former president shared Thursday wasn't a threat, but an antiwar rallying cry that liberals used to share.",
    "story": [
      "Bill Maher has been a critic of Donald Trump since the earliest days of his 2016 run for president.",
      "But on Friday, the liberal pundit defended the GOP presidential nominee for imagining how former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) would react to having guns trained at her, and argued on his show, HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time,\u201d that Trump\u2019s remark expressed the same antiwar notion that liberals used to share.",
      "At a campaign event with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday, the former president called Cheney a \u201cwar hawk.\u201d Both Cheney and her father, former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, have endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle, standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let\u2019s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He went on: \u201cYou know, they\u2019re all war hawks when they\u2019re sitting in Washington in a nice building, saying, \u2018Aw, gee, well, let\u2019s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Maher argued the former president\u2019s fantasy about Cheney getting shot at was just a poorly worded argument for non-interventionist foreign policy.",
      "\u201cI woke up today to the headline that Trump had called for a firing squad for Liz Cheney,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cAnd this is what I really don\u2019t like about the media \u2014 no, he didn\u2019t.

    "title": "Federal Union Blasts Montana GOP Senate Hopeful For 'Disdain' Of Wildland Firefighters",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 13:07:36 -0400",
    "summary": "The blistering remarks come after HuffPost first revealed that Tim Sheehy accused wildland firefighters of laziness and \u201cmilking\u201d fires for overtime pay.",
    "story": [
      "A union representing thousands of federal wildland firefighters excoriated Montana GOP Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy after he accused firefighters of dragging their feet to put out infernos and \u201cmilking\u201d disasters for overtime pay.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s comments are not only unfounded and disrespectful of wildland firefighters across the country, but they also show a severe lack of understanding of the essential and dangerous work these brave men and women do to defend our country from devastating fires \u2013 especially communities in Montana,\u201d said Randy Erwin, the national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, in a press release dated Thursday.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s disdain for firefighters is out of step with true Montanans and the rest of America,\u201d he added.",
      "Erwin\u2019s blistering takedown comes about two weeks after HuffPost first reported that Sheehy, who made millions running an aerial firefighting company that relies heavily on lucrative federal contracts, has repeatedly claimed, with little evidence, that a significant number of boots-on-the-ground firefighters are standing around while wildfires rage.",
      "In the 2023 book \u201cMudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting,\u201d Sheehy described an encounter with firefighters battling blazes in Idaho in 2015. He wrote that one firefighting pilot told him of the blaze: \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to go too fast. ... There\u2019s a lot of overtime pay to be earned out there! We put it out, it\u2019s back on salary!\u2019\u201d",
      "That conversation \u201csmacked less of concern or common sense than it did laziness \u2014 or, worse, greed,\u201d Sheehy wrote. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it malevolence; anyone who climbs into a plane or picks up a shovel to fight wildfires clearly has a capacity for goodness and a desire to help. That said, even in positions that are demonstrably service-oriented, there is the potential for self-interest, if not outright corruption, leading to a response that is not necessarily in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is no fire, there is no money,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the faster that a fire is extinguished, the sooner the money dries up or goes elsewhere. It might seem ridiculous to worry about a shortage of work to keep the wildfire industry busy given the extraordinary expansion of the season in recent years, not to mention the gnawing sense that firefighters will forever be overmatched against nature. But old beliefs and protocols die hard, and clearly there were some in the industry who saw nothing wrong with milking every fire for what it was worth despite the risks and the blurring of ethical boundaries.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not the only time Sheehy has hurled such accusations at public servants who work in the same field as him. Sheehy is the founder of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, a company that has a fleet of firefighting aircraft, and he has consistently highlighted his company\u2019s work in campaign ads and speeches. At a book signing in Huntsville, Alabama, in April, months after launching his campaign against three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, Sheehy told attendees, \u201cThere\u2019s a very real dynamic in wildfire that a lot of those people don\u2019t want to put the fire out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to put the fire out because that\u2019s where they get their overtime, that\u2019s where they get their hazard pay,\u201d he added.",
      "Wildland firefighters are notoriously underpaid for a job that is becoming increasingly dangerous amid worsening climate change.",
      "In an October post on X, formerly Twitter, Tester called Sheehy\u2019s comments \u201cinsulting.\u201d",
      "On its website, the National Federation of Federal Employees notes that its advocacy for wildland firefighters includes \u201cfighting for a permanent, competitive pay fix, enhanced mental health and physical wellbeing resources, adequate housing, and more.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s press release, Erwin said that NFFE represents many federal wildland firefighters across the country, including in Montana. And he highlighted the myriad challenges these workers are facing.",
      "\u201cWildland firefighters have been doing more with less for decades, and the current shortage of firefighters places them and other first responders at greater risk while they work longer deployments fighting hotter and bigger fires each year,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSheehy and his arial company have profited heavily from taxpayer-funded contracts to fight wildfires while many wildland firefighters struggle to pay the rent because of low pay.\u201d",
      "He slammed Sheehy\u2019s remarks as \u201celitist and self-serving.\u201d",
      "\u201cFederal wildland firefighters and other first responders deserve better, as do all the residents of Montana,\u201d Erwin said.",

    "summary": "This year\u2019s election is unlike any other in the 76 years since the U.S. began allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their governor.",
    "story": [
      "VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico \u2014 Eliezer Concepci\u00f3n worked for years at his roadside mechanic shop to save enough money to buy a piece of his hometown before it was too late.",
      "In 2020, he finally purchased a dilapidated house in this beachside enclave roughly 45 minutes west of the sprawling capital of San Juan. It took him two years to renovate a dwelling destroyed in 2017\u2019s Hurricane Mar\u00eda into a functioning Airbnb. But he saw it as a way to earn extra money by tapping into the Caribbean island\u2019s $10 billion tourism industry \u2014 and to keep the cash circulating locally.",
      "For years, Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial tax haven laws have drawn wealthy Americans looking to avoid income taxes and sparked a property gold rush that pits lower-paid, Spanish-speaking natives against cash-rich Anglophone newcomers. But Concepci\u00f3n, 43, was determined to keep at least his piece of the town in the hands of a real Vegabaje\u00f1o.",
      "\u201cMy neighbors are all selling,\u201d Concepci\u00f3n, 43, said on a July afternoon, leaning back in the leather chair of the tiny office of his auto body shop. \u201cBut I wanted a good chance for someone from here to buy and rebuild.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s getting harder to reject the routine cash offers from real estate speculators. Since the privately held LUMA Energy took over operations of Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid from the bankrupt state-owned utility PREPA in 2021, the power goes out weekly, if not daily, and bills keep going up. A lack of consistent air conditioning or refrigeration deters guests, leaving Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s vacation rental business struggling. He wonders how long he can hold out \u2014 and how Puerto Rico\u2019s historic election next week could forever change the dynamics in what is considered the world\u2019s oldest colony.",
      "While they are full U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans living on the island can\u2019t vote for the president, and the lone delegate they send to Congress has no real legislative powers. That makes the gubernatorial race the territory\u2019s most important election \u2014 and this year\u2019s is unlike any other in the 76 years since the U.S. began allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor.",
      "That\u2019s because, when Concepci\u00f3n goes to the polls next week, he\u2019ll be among the first American citizens since the Civil War with a real shot at electing a governor from a party pushing for independence from the United States.",
      "Juan Dalmau, the gubernatorial nominee from the once-marginalized Puerto Rican Independence Party, is now in second place, and polls show the race tightening amid the island\u2019s fury over remarks a speaker made last Sunday at former President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Manhattan calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "The front-runner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, is a Republican and Trump ally representing the New Progressive Party, the pro-statehood party that has ruled Puerto Rico continuously since 2016.",
      "Jes\u00fas Manuel Ortiz Gonz\u00e1lez, the nominee from the traditional opposition Popular Democratic Party, which advocates retaining Puerto Rico\u2019s territorial status, struggled to break through but is now competing with Dalmau for second place in the most recent poll.",
      "The Fraught History That Led To This Point",
      "The central faultline in Puerto Rican politics has long been the territory\u2019s relationship with the mainland U.S. After seizing the island as a colony in the spoils of Washington\u2019s victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the U.S. violently suppressed Puerto Rico\u2019s independence movement for decades.",
      "As Europe began dismantling its empires after World War II, the U.S. granted the Philippines its independence but cut a separate deal with Puerto Rico, giving the island limited autonomy as a \u201ccommonwealth\u201d and U.S. territory.",
      "Puerto Rican rebels, under the command of the Harvard-trained lawyer and independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos, attempted an armed uprising in 1950. But the U.S. military, in a singular act of deploying the Air Force against its own citizens, bombed a rebel stronghold in the mountains, leveling almost the entire town. Even waving a pro-independence flag became an offense punished with years of jail time.",
      "From that point on, local control of Puerto Rico passed between the two main political parties duking it out each election cycle. On one side was the Popular Democratic Party, known by its Spanish acronym PPD, which supported the commonwealth status quo. On the other was the New Progressive Party, or PNP, which called for U.S. statehood. The pro-independence PIP remained a minor third party akin to the Green Party, earning at most a tiny single-digit percentage of the vote each election.",
      "That arrangement worked for much of the rest of the 20th century, when federal support helped industrialize Puerto Rico and raise living standards. In 1996, however, Clinton-era reforms saw the federal government phase out the tax credit that had drawn manufacturers to the island. As factories closed, Puerto Rico\u2019s government tried to make up for the jobs by hiring more teachers and police officers. But as the industrial tax base evaporated, Puerto Rico borrowed more and more money by issuing bonds that Wall Street expected would be backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.",
      "By 2016, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and unfunded pension obligations reached a combined $126 billion. The island went bankrupt.",
      "Not an independent country, Puerto Rico could not get help refinancing from international lenders. Not a fully incorporated part of the U.S., either, the territory could not access the bankruptcy protections from which states and municipalities like Detroit benefit.",
      "Instead, Congress \u2014 which legally considers Puerto Rico and the four other permanently populated U.S. territories \u201cpossessions\u201d \u2014 passed a law called the PROMESA Act, after the Spanish word for \u201cpromise,\u201d which gave a White House-appointed board of financial overseers veto power over all the spending of the island\u2019s elected government.",
      "The fiscal control board \u2014 known pejoratively among locals as \u201cla junta,\u201d the term for a ruling council in military dictatorships \u2014 instituted harsh austerity measures, closing hundreds of schools and slashing pensions in a place with worse poverty than the poorest U.S. state.",
      "Then came Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a catastrophe from which Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure has yet to recover. While the precise death toll is debated, most scholars agree the aftermath of the storm killed thousands who might have otherwise survived if they had had access to refrigerated medicine or clean water after the blackout disabled groundwater pumps.",
      "In the summer of 2019, text messages between then-Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and his inner circle showed the pro-statehood leader making jokes about the bloated bodies of Puerto Ricans killed during the storm two years earlier. As many as 1 million Puerto Ricans flooded the streets in protest, demanding his resignation.",
      "The chaos didn\u2019t stop when Rossell\u00f3 stepped down in disgrace. He tried appointing Pedro Pierluisi, a former coal lobbyist, as governor. But state courts intervened and instead selected Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced to lead the island from 2019 to 2021 (Pierluisi then won the 2020 election to succeed her, and is the island\u2019s current governor). In 2022, just as protests over the LUMA contract were growing, federal authorities arrested V\u00e1zquez in a corruption scandal.",
      "To Dalmau, the events showed Puerto Rico was primed for radical change. Sure enough, when he ran for governor in 2020, he won 14% of the vote \u2014 seven times the largest share of ballots the Independence Party had ever won and the first time it had earned a double-digit share of the vote.",
      "How A \u2018Radical\u2019 Candidate Went Mainstream",
      "Like Albizu Campos, Juan Manuel Dalmau Ram\u00edrez is a Harvard-trained lawyer. Dalmau, 51, served in Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate before becoming the standard-bearer for the Puerto Rican Independence Party, or PIP, in the 2020 election.",
      "His surprisingly strong performance wasn\u2019t the only sign the two-party duopoly on Puerto Rico\u2019s politics was crumbling. That same year saw upstart parties that eschewed the status question field competitive nominees.",
      "On the right, the Christian-democratic Dignity Project party sought to unite the largely Catholic island around conservative social reforms, like tighter abortion restrictions and a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. On the left, the Citizens Victory Movement endorsed more liberal social policies but advocated primarily for ending Puerto Rico\u2019s colonial arrangement with the U.S. In a bid to cleave voters from both traditional parties, neither new party openly backed statehood or independence.",
      "In 2020, the Citizens Victory Movement came close to winning the race for San Juan mayor, arguably the island\u2019s second-most influential position after governor. This year, the Independence Party and the Citizens Victory Movement formed a coalition called Alianza, or \u201cAlliance.\u201d",
      "The Citizens Victory Movement\u2019s energetic organizing, combined with the Independence Party\u2019s experience running in elections for decades, has launched Dalmau into second place in recent polls.",
      "Dalmau\u2019s pitch for breaking off from the U.S. is really something closer to a conscious uncoupling. He envisions weaning Puerto Rico off federal funding over a 25-year period and striking a deal to give members of the Puerto Rican diaspora \u2014 twice as many Puerto Ricans live in states like New York and Florida as on the island \u2014 the option for dual passports.",
      "The recently privatized power grid will need to come back under government management, but Dalmau wants to attract big companies with tax breaks like the ones the U.S. government once used to develop a manufacturing industry in Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cOur platform is going to support a democratic decolonization process,\u201d Dalmau told HuffPost in July after a press conference at a landmark building in the upscale San Juan neighborhood of Miramar. \u201cPuerto Ricans are a nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent.\u201d",
      "During the world wars, the U.S. military\u2019s outposts in Puerto Rico helped Washington maintain control over the Caribbean and routes to the Panama Canal. During the Cold War, Puerto Rico served as a vital defense hub and a model for the benefits of American capitalism over communism once Fidel Castro took power in neighboring Cuba.",
      "But now, Dalmau said, Puerto Rico no longer hosts major military operations, and its debt crisis is an ongoing embarrassment to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico has become a burden,\u201d he said.",
      "Puerto Ricans are split over the island\u2019s future relationship with the U.S. A survey released last month by El Nuevo D\u00eda, the territory\u2019s newspaper of record, showed 44% of voters back statehood and a combined 44% favor sovereignty. Of the latter set, 25% support a compact of free association with the U.S. \u2014 a deal akin to what Palau and Micronesia have, allowing the former U.S. Pacific territories to represent themselves at the United Nations but still benefit from federal funding \u2014 and 19% back independence.",
      "Either way, Dalmau has sought to play down the independence issue, particularly as voters prepare to cast ballots simultaneously in a nonbinding referendum over whether Puerto Rico should become a state, independent or something else. For the first time in the long history of failed plebiscites over Puerto Rico\u2019s status, where one side or the other often boycotted the vote to make the results meaningless, this referendum does not include the option for the status quo.",
      "Rather than peg his candidacy to independence, Dalmau has pitched himself as a crusader against what he called the \u201ctwo-headed monster\u201d of the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent,\u201d Dalmau said. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018I was PNP, I was PPD, we have to get these people out of office.\u2019\u201d",
      "The MAGA Front-Runner",
      "Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, who leads the gubernatorial race, has sought to revive old fears of independence by linking Dalmau to socialist authoritarians in Latin America. Ads running on TV show him alongside Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, Cuban leader Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel and Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega.",
      "Ironically, it\u2019s her party, the pro-statehood PNP, that has the closest connections to Venezuela\u2019s embattled regime.",
      "As part of a massive corruption investigation, federal authorities arrested the former PNP governor, V\u00e1zquez, in 2022 on bribery charges. Among those charged with her was Julio Martin Herrera Velutini, a banker who financed her failed election campaign in 2020. The Department of Justice accused Herrera Velutini of bribing V\u00e1zquez as part of a deal to take control of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial regulator to hide a multimillion-dollar portfolio of dirty money linked to the Venezuelan regime.",
      "Like Dalmau, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n \u2014 who currently serves as Puerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress \u2014 ran on changing the contract between the island and LUMA Energy after it took over the territory\u2019s electrical grid three years ago under a privatization effort the fiscal control board promoted.",
      "Her tough-talking ads on radio and television helped her defeat incumbent governor Pierluisi in the PNP\u2019s primary earlier this year.",
      "A spokesperson for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n declined HuffPost\u2019s request to meet in Puerto Rico over the summer and initially offered to set up an interview remotely a week later. But multiple subsequent emails and phone calls went unanswered.",
      "On the campaign trail, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n has claimed credit for the increase in federal funding the Biden administration has provided to Puerto Rico, and promised to hold LUMA accountable for ongoing blackouts. But Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican in her stateside politics and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, was among the strongest supporters of privatizing Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical system. While the Biden administration has promoted solar energy, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n joined her fellow Republicans in advocating for Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial natural gas buildout.",
      "\u201cI see her as arrogant. She talks tough,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rosario Borres, 53, a retired school janitor from the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. \u201cShe kept lying and lying. It\u2019s written in black and white history. When you lie to Puerto Ricans, you disrespect us and underestimate our intelligence.\u201d",
      "Rosario Borres, who depends on an electric wheelchair due to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, said he needed cheaper, more reliable power. On a July afternoon, he came to an evangelical church in Santa Isabel to see U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm unveil a new program to provide solar panels to low-income households.",
      "He said he voted for Pierluisi in the primary. Now, he said, he may not vote at all. If he does, he said, his vote may go to Dalmau.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Juan than the PPD,\u201d he said, referring to the status-quo commonwealth party that served as the statehood party\u2019s traditional opposition.",
      "In Cata\u00f1o, a densely populated city neighborhood across the bay from scenic Old San Juan, Lissette Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos, a nun and environmentalist, criticized Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n\u2019s support for fossil fuel projects, including a controversial natural gas import terminal operating with federal permits.",
      "\u201cShe was pushing for more natural gas as the resident commissioner all while she was planning a run for governor,\u201d Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos said.",
      "Back in Vega Baja, Angel Manuel Ciordia, 75, said he would vote for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n because he believes statehood is the best path forward for Puerto Rico. But he said it\u2019s unlikely to make any difference if Trump wins back the White House.",
      "\u201cIt all depends on who the president is,\u201d said Ciordia, a retired radio executive, during an interview outside his home. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want us.\u201d",
      "Historically, Republicans championed statehood for Puerto Rico. In recent years, however, liberals have seized on the issue, conflating the movement with the push to admit the District of Columbia as its own state. The GOP has dismissed the effort as a bid to inflate Democratic power in the Senate, since D.C. is a liberal stronghold, though there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that socially conservative Puerto Rico would yield similar partisan outcomes.",
      "Recent GOP rhetoric suggesting Puerto Rican statehood would yield two liberal senators appears to have taken hold among voters. A YouGov poll released Thursday showed 79% of Democrats and just 41% of Republicans supporting statehood. Asked whether they would back Puerto Rico\u2019s independence, Democratic support plunged to 56%, while Republican backing rose slightly to 46%.",
      "Overall, however, 59% of Americans said they would support admitting Puerto Rico as a state if that\u2019s what voters on the island wanted. Just 16% opposed statehood, and 25% said they did not know enough to answer.",
      "Some voters themselves seemed to shrug off the sovereignty stakes of the election.",
      "\u201cI just want the government to help fishermen,\u201d Miguel Santiago said outside a bar on Vega Baja\u2019s main beach.",
      "He didn\u2019t have strong opinions about either top gubernatorial candidate but said the effects of climate change are shrinking the fish populations, and those whose livelihoods depend on large catches need the government to provide more subsidies and curbs on imported seafood.",
      "William Gibson, 60, a retired teacher sunbathing on the beach, said he had decamped permanently for Colombia. But he rolled his eyes when asked about Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and said he would not cast a ballot for her.",
      "In July, Concepci\u00f3n worried that Dalmau could not possibly compete with the well-funded campaigns from the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cDalmau has a good message, but that isn\u2019t what people see,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey hear radio ads. They see TV ads. They get what the people with money to pay for them want us to see. And that\u2019s not the Independence Party.\u201d",
      "He hadn\u2019t yet decided how he would vote. But he said Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n was \u201csmart and more in touch with the people\u201d than the incumbent from her party, Pierluisi, and he was leaning toward voting for her.",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve seen her with friends of mine, regular people,\u201d he said. He grew quiet for a moment, then exhaled. \u201cShe at least looks like someone who can listen to people.\u201d",
      "Since then, however, Dalmau has racked up endorsements from some of Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest celebrities, including the music superstars Bad Bunny and Residente, and scored major interviews with influential local reporters.",
      "Meanwhile, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remark at Trump\u2019s rally went viral, stirring voters\u2019 resentments of Trump for his mishandling of the 2017 hurricane and redrawing the connection between Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and the presidential candidate she supports. At the high school that one of Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s four children attends, Dalmau won students\u2019 mock election.",

    "summary": "Hugh Hewitt removed his earpiece and stormed off a Post live show amid a discussion about Donald Trump's rhetoric.",

      "Hugh Hewitt, a conservative columnist for The Washington Post, revealed that he quit the newspaper Friday following a livestreamed feud with journalist Jonathan Capehart over Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric amid the presidential election.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t come back, Jonathan. I\u2019m done!\u201d Hewitt had said on Washington Post Live\u2019s \u201cFirst Look\u201d show, removing his earpiece and storming off.",
      "\u201cThis is the most unfair election ad I have ever been a part of,\u201d he told Capehart and another Post writer, Ruth Marcus. \u201cYou guys are working. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m done.\u201d",
      "Hewitt\u2019s reaction arrived after Capehart suggested Trump was \u201claying the groundwork for contesting\u201d this year\u2019s vote results, following the GOP presidential nominee\u2019s recent claim that there had been \u201ccheating\u201d in Pennsylvania.",
      "Hewitt, who said that he voted for Trump last month, interrupted Marcus as she predicted the former president would \u201crev up his supporters to contest elections\u201d and also go to court to make \u201cwhatever arguments he can, no matter how far-fetched.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are news people, even though we have opinions, and we have to report the whole story if we bring up part of the story,\u201d Hewitt said.",
      "\u201cYes, he\u2019s upset about [Pennsylvania\u2019s] Bucks County, but he was right and he won in court,\u201d Hewitt said of Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s the story.\u201d",

      "Capehart said he didn\u2019t \u201cappreciate being lectured about reporting\u201d when Hewitt has shared \u201clots of things that aren\u2019t basic fact\u201d on the Post show.",
      "That response led to Hewitt\u2019s meltdown, and the program subsequently experienced technical difficulties before Capehart brought it to a close.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) on Friday reminded Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that he\u2019s a politician and not her doctor as she went after GOP officials for their defense of the state\u2019s strict abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want my governor, I don\u2019t want AG Paxton, I definitely don\u2019t want Ted Cruz telling me what to do with my body if my doctor has a recommendation because the last time I checked, I don\u2019t need any of them to be my doctor,\u201d she told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, referring to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them to be my elected officials,\u201d she added.",
      "Crockett appeared on MSNBC as Hayes highlighted the death of Nevaeh Crain, a Texas teenager and one of at least two pregnant women in the state who died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica reported.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk about women\u2019s lives being on the line in this election, it\u2019s not a slogan, it\u2019s not hyperbole,\u201d said Hayes.

    "summary": "A federal jury has convicted a former Kentucky detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor the night she was shot to death by police officers in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead.",
      "The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor\u2019s neighbors.",
      "It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid.",
      "Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor, but chose to continue deliberating. The six man, six woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days.",
      "Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: \u201cIt took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.\u201d",
      "Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s glass door and windows during the raid, but didn\u2019t hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor\u2019s adjoining apartment.",
      "The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked racial injustice protests nationwide.",
      "Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict \u201ca long-awaited moment of accountability.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,\u201d King said in a social media post Friday night.",
      "A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.",
      "The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings.",
      "Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor\u2019s door with a battering ram.",
      "This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots.",
      "That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison\u2019s attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive\u201d when Hankison fired.",
      "After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating.",
      "Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor\u2019s glass door and a window.",
      "Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker\u2019s fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway.",
      "Hankison\u2019s lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly \u201cin a very tense, very chaotic environment\u201d that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison\u2019s shots didn\u2019t hit anyone.",
      "Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor\u2019s civil rights. Hankison\u2019s verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case.",
      "Malarcik, Hankison\u2019s attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sgt. John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark.",
      "\u201cBrett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,\u201d Malarcik said.",
      "Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn\u2019t see a target.",

      "A Montana man accused of killing a camper in a brutal attack initially believed to have been caused by a bear has been arrested, Gallatin County officials said Thursday at a news conference.",
      "Daren Christopher Abbey, 41, was charged with deliberate homicide in the killing of Dustin Kjersem, 35, who was found dead inside his tent near Big Sky on Oct. 12 by his girlfriend, officials said. It was not immediately clear if Abbey had an attorney representing him.",
      "Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said Kjersem had planned a weekend camping trip with his girlfriend and arrived early on Oct.10 to set up the campsite. He was supposed to pick her up the following day after she finished working, but he did not show up.",
      "Springer said Kjersem\u2019s girlfriend went to the campsite on Oct.12 with a friend and found him dead inside his tent.",
      "In an earlier news release by the sheriff\u2019s office, authorities said that because of the viciousness of the attack, the caller who reported Kjersem dead said it may have been caused by a bear. However, there were no signs of bear activity at the campsite, and an autopsy determined Kjersem\u2019s death was a homicide.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 18:33:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The president visited the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania to talk about Democrats' pension rescue and how it's helping retirees.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden reminded Pennsylvanians on Friday that he, Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats safeguarded more than 1 million people\u2019s pensions without any help from the GOP.",
      "Visiting a union hall in Philadelphia, Biden and local union leaders highlighted the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and how it funded union pension plans that were facing insolvency. The pensions of an estimated 1.2 million workers and retirees have been protected from cuts due to the legislation.",
      "It was no accident that the event took place in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most critical of battleground states for Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and for her opponent, former President Donald Trump. Democrats have worried about Harris\u2019 strength with the kind of blue-collar union voters whose pensions were backstopped by the bill.",
      "Biden made sure anyone listening knew that the pension rescue got no Republican backing when Democrats muscled it through Congress over three years ago as part of a larger, pandemic-era stimulus package. It passed on a party-line vote in the Senate, with Harris casting a tie-breaker at a critical juncture for the bill.",
      "The president said the vote underscored the hyperpartisan nature of Congress these days.",
      "\u201cWe used to have real differences in the Senate. But at least when the critical things, we ended up getting together. But not anymore,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a different deal we\u2019re working with. Not a single, solitary Republican in the House or the Senate, not one, voted to help with the pensions. Not one single one.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the way things have gotten,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "He said that he and Harris \u201cworked like hell\u201d to include the pension rescue, known as the Butch Lewis Act, as part of the American Rescue Plan, and theorized that some Republicans would have voted for it but were afraid to cross party leaders.",
      "\u201cI believe a lot of those Republicans who voted no thought it was wrong. But they\u2019re afraid to vote the right way,\u201d Biden said.",
      "The legislation provided an estimated $74 billion to $91 billion to shore up troubled multiemployer pension plans, which are funds that employers pay into under collective bargaining agreements. The funds can run into trouble when union membership declines over time, with more retirees drawing down benefits and fewer contributions going in on behalf of active workers.",
      "The White House said Pennsylvania is home to an estimated 65,000 of the workers and retirees helped by the legislation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government-run entity that insures multiemployer pension plans, said Friday it had approved an application to pump $684 million into a plan covering 29,000 workers and retirees in the service sector.",
      "The pension rescue became something of a campaign story after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\u2019 executive board declined to make an endorsement in the presidential race. The Teamsters had the largest pension plan saved from cuts, and so the decision not to back Harris angered many members and labor allies",
      "John Pishko, a retired Teamster from western Pennsylvania, spoke at the Philadelphia event about how the legislation helped save his retirement. He said he was set to lose 30% of his pension benefit, or about $1,000 a month, before Democrats stepped in with the bailout.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty substantial cut to any working man,\u201d Pishko said. \u201cIt was devastating.\u201d",
      "He had assumed he would \u201cnever\u201d be able to stave off those cuts.",
      "\u201cIt matters when you have a president and vice president who has your back,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cEye-opening, long, frustrating, depressing, hearing the story,\u201d Aubrey said Thursday in an interview conducted by a member of the Cowboys\u2019 media relations staff. \u201cThe story was a sad one. I don\u2019t really want to get into all the details of the story, but it was very depressing and dragged on longer than anybody expected it to. So, glad it\u2019s over.\u201d",
      "Aubrey wasn\u2019t in the Dallas locker room during the team\u2019s media availability on Thursday. A team staffer emailed a transcript of the interview with the kicker to the media later in the day.",
      "A year ago, Aubrey set an NFL record as a 28-year-old rookie by making the first 35 kicks of his career. A record streak of eight consecutive games with at least one field goal of 50 yards or longer ended last weekend in a 30-24 loss to San Francisco. The Cowboys (3-4) visit Atlanta (5-3) on Sunday.",
      "With Aubrey\u2019s anonymity likely blown by that kind of eventful start to his career, he said the judge told everyone during jury selection who he was.",
      "Aubrey said he has a sister-in-law who is a prosecutor, and she had assured him his celebrity would disqualify him.",
      "Aubrey, who had postponed his jury summons once but wasn\u2019t allowed to do it again, also thought he had a suitable conflict to present to the judge \u2014 being at the team\u2019s facility to prepare for last weekend\u2019s game in San Francisco.",
      "The judge acknowledged him by name and said he could come back to him on the issue of conflicts, Aubrey said. The next thing the kicker knows, the judge is saying Aubrey won\u2019t have any conflicts because the court won\u2019t be in session over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI could have been more assertive and at that point, everyone knows who I am there, and I don\u2019t want to sound like I think I\u2019m better than anyone else or that I\u2019m above the job,\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cSo kind of sat there quietly and didn\u2019t say anything, which was probably a mistake. I figured at that point still, he\u2019s not going to pick me.\u201d",
      "As it turned out, Aubrey had to scramble to get in his kicking work during the week. He didn\u2019t get to the facility until close to sundown Thursday of last week, first fighting the sunset and actually kicking in the dark for a spell with long snapper Trent Sieg and his holder, punter Bryan Anger.",
      "Aubrey couldn\u2019t kick in the comfort \u2014 and under the lights \u2014 of the team\u2019s indoor practice facility because of a high school game.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t really see where you\u2019re kicking, and for Bryan in particular, trying to catch the snaps, he had a hard time at first tracking the ball and hitting the spot,\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cSo, it was a lot harder, but really just wanted to get the leg moving and keep the body fresh for game day.\u201d",
      "Aubrey wasn\u2019t really tested against the 49ers, making his only field-goal attempt from 29 yards and all three extra points.",

      "The ceremony was held in Salem, Massachusetts, the site of the infamous Salem Witch Trials during the late 1600s, which saw hundreds accused \u2014 and around 20 executed \u2014 as supposed \u201cwitches.\u201d",
      "Daniels was appropriately dressed like one when she accepted the first annual \u201cSalem Witches\u2019 Woman of Power Award\u201d at the town commons and, in front of hundreds of fellow witches, chronicled living in a mobile home as a result of the blowback from her testimony about the former president.",
      "\u201cI was put on the stand two years ago and someone said I was unfit to testify because I was a witch,\u201d said Daniels, per The Guardian. \u201cI was honest, I was telling the truth and I was persecuted. To me this award should inspire others to speak up and not be silenced.\u201d",

      "\u201cNo one understands what the last six years have been like for me,\u201d she added. \u201cEveryone else gets to turn off the TV and forget about politics, which has reached this next-level, dark insanity.

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 13:18:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Still, the tech mogul's ploy to move a civil lawsuit against him to federal court made the point of the suit nearly moot.",
    "story": [
      "In his face-off against Elon Musk, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has already earned at least one important win.",
      "A judge on Friday granted Krasner\u2019s request to keep a civil lawsuit he filed against Musk and Musk\u2019s pro-Trump America PAC in state court, rather than having it moved to federal court as the tech billionaire wished.",
      "Musk, for his part, filed a motion seeking to quash any personal appearance he is ordered to make in court, saying that his attendance is unnecessary because the case is largely focused on actions of America PAC.",
      "Earlier Friday morning, Musk had accused Krasner of engaging in a \u201crushed stage play\u201d and a \u201cspectacle\u201d as he urged a federal judge to deny Krasner\u2019s emergency request to keep the suit in state court.",
      "Krasner sued the billionaire and his pro-Donald Trump America PAC over their pledge to give away $1 million daily to registered voters. Musk claims the giveaway is random, but Krasner alleges that Musk is intentionally targeting people in battleground states with an \u201cillegal lottery scheme\u201d meant to influence voters.",
      "Musk has argued that Krasner must square off with America PAC attorneys in federal court because the lawsuit raises questions about a federal election and the federal laws that govern political action committees, not state matters.",
      "Krasner is adamant that his lawsuit isn\u2019t about whether Musk and America PAC are violating federal laws that ban vote-buying. Rather, the district attorney wants a state court, not a federal one, to determine whether the program violates Pennsylvania\u2019s prohibitions against illegal lotteries.",
      "Attorneys for Musk\u2019s PAC filed a notice in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania federal court this week requesting to have the case remanded there. Explaining this maneuver in a brief filed Friday, a lawyer for the PAC wrote that the group\u2019s expenditures are \u201cpolitical speech\u201d and thus \u201centitled to First Amendment protections,\u201d which is a federal jurisdictional issue.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert disagreed.",
      "Musk and America PAC \u201chave not identified any question of federal law that must be resolved in Plaintiff\u2019s favor in order to prove either state-law claim,\u201d Pappert\u2019s memorandum states.",
      "\u201cDefendants argue the Complaint\u2019s references to \u2018the forthcoming Federal Presidential Election\u2019 show the lawsuit necessarily raises questions of federal law,\u201d Pappert wrote. \u201cBut federal question jurisdiction does not turn on a plaintiff\u2019s motivations in filing suit; it turns on whether the legal issues arising from the claims originate in federal or state law.\u201d",
      "The ploy to have the lawsuit remanded to federal court may have been a boon for Musk anyway. The giveaway ends on Nov. 5, meaning that by the time the courts decide the next steps, the initiative will already be over.",
      "The Justice Department warned Musk in a letter last month that he may run afoul of federal election laws against compensating voters, but Musk was undeterred.",
      "Four giveaway winners are from Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, according to a website for the program. So far, the PAC has given away a total of $14 million to voters who signed the petition that states they agree to support the First and Second Amendments. The website indicates that winners will be declared through Nov. 5. As of Friday, the site specified that those winners would be selected in Arizona and Wisconsin, which are also battleground states in the 2024 election.",
      "Musk and Krasner were initially meant to face off in court on Friday, but the hearing was brought forward to Thursday. Krasner had asked to move the hearing to a more secure venue following a deluge of threats he said he received.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 11:40:11 -0400",
    "summary": "William Luna started carving faces of deceased loved ones in 2017 to honor his rmother. Now he does them for others -- and strives to make them as accurate as possible.",
    "story": [
      "EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 During the Day of the Dead celebrations that take place in late October and early November, Latin Americans honor their departed loved ones by setting up altars adorned with food, flowers and photographs. But what about carving the actual face of your deceased spouse or family member on a plaster to decorate a piece of bread?",
      "That is exactly what one artist in Bolivia is doing.",
      "As part of a centuries-old tradition to honor their dead on Nov. 2, Bolivians share a sweet bread called \u201ctantawawa\u201d (Aymara for \u201cbaby bread\u201d) in a symbolic way to connect the living with the dead.",
      "Traditionally, the \u201ctantawawa\u201d are decorated with generic, plastered faces, but Bolivian artist William Luna thought it would be even more symbolic if he could carve out a feature that resembles the loved ones that people are remembering.",
      "Inspired by the loss of his mother, Luna began sculpting her face onto a \u201ctantawawa\u201d for the first anniversary of her death in 2017. He then introduced this idea to local markets, and now receives requests from families eager to honor their loved ones in this unique way.",
      "\u201cFamilies ask for the masks to resemble their deceased loved ones as closely as possible,\u201d Luna explains. \u201cI focus on each person\u2019s distinctive features, as we all have something special that sets us apart.\u201d",
      "Luna meticulously crafts each mask, starting with a photo of the departed individual. He then shapes clay using his fingers and modeling tools to capture the person\u2019s likeness. Once satisfied with the clay model, he creates a plastic mold and fills it with plaster. The final step involves painting the mask, sometimes with the help of the family.",
      "The entire process takes about a week.",
      "Milton Eyzaguirre, an anthropologist from the National Museum of Ethnography and Folklore in La Paz, said that there\u2019s not an exact record of the origin of the \u201ctantawawa\u201d, only that they are pre-Hispanic. Historically, the bread was made with quinoa flour, but now wheat is commonly used.",
      "\u201cOur tradition holds that souls return hungry and thirsty, and that is why families have food waiting for them,\u201d he said.",
      "Luna, the artist, says that his idea is to give people a way to see their deceased loved ones again.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s only in this way,\u201d he said, gazing at some of the plastered faces.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 11:39:55 -0400",
    "summary": "It took three ER visits and 20 hours before a hospital admitted Nevaeh Crain, 18, as her condition worsened. Doctors insisted on two ultrasounds to confirm \u201cfetal demise.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "This story was originally published by ProPublica.",
      "Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. \u201cDo something,\u201d she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023.",
      "Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before.",
      "The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave.",
      "Now on Crain\u2019s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to \u201cconfirm fetal demise,\u201d a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care.",
      "By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain\u2019s blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were \u201cblue and dusky.\u201d Her organs began failing.",
      "Hours later, she was dead.",
      "Fails, who would have seen her daughter turn 20 this Friday, still cannot understand why Crain\u2019s emergency was not treated like an emergency.",
      "But that is what many pregnant women are now facing in states with strict abortion bans, doctors and lawyers have told ProPublica.",
      "\u201cPregnant women have become essentially untouchables,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor emerita at George Washington University.",
      "Texas\u2019s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, whether the pregnancy is wanted or not. It includes exceptions for life-threatening conditions, but still, doctors told ProPublica that confusion and fear about the potential legal repercussions are changing the way their colleagues treat pregnant patients with complications.",
      "In states with abortion bans, such patients are sometimes bounced between hospitals like \u201chot potatoes,\u201d with health care providers reluctant to participate in treatment that could attract a prosecutor, doctors told ProPublica. In some cases, medical teams are wasting precious time debating legalities and creating documentation, preparing for the possibility that they\u2019ll need to explain their actions to a jury and judge.",
      "Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, said patients are left wondering: \u201cAm I being sent home because I really am OK? Or am I being sent home because they\u2019re afraid that the solution to what\u2019s going on with my pregnancy would be ending the pregnancy, and they\u2019re not allowed to do that?\u201d",
      "There is a federal law to prevent emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care.",
      "Passed nearly four decades ago, it requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical crises. The Biden administration argues this mandate applies even in cases where an abortion might be necessary.",
      "No state has done more to fight this interpretation than Texas, which has warned doctors that its abortion ban supersedes the administration\u2019s guidance on federal law, and that they can face up to 99 years in prison for violating it.",
      "ProPublica condensed more than 800 pages of Crain\u2019s medical records into a four-page timeline in consultation with two maternal-fetal medicine specialists; reporters reviewed it with nine doctors, including researchers at prestigious universities, OB-GYNs who regularly handle miscarriages, and experts in emergency medicine and maternal health.",
      "Some said the first ER missed warning signs of infection that deserved attention. All said that the doctor at the second hospital should never have sent Crain home when her signs of sepsis hadn\u2019t improved. And when she returned for the third time, all said there was no medical reason to make her wait for two ultrasounds before taking aggressive action to save her.",
      "\u201cThis is how these restrictions kill women,\u201d said Dr. Dara Kass, a former regional director at the Department of Health and Human Services and an emergency room physician in New York. \u201cIt is never just one decision, it\u2019s never just one doctor, it\u2019s never just one nurse.\u201d",
      "While they were not certain from looking at the records provided that Crain\u2019s death could have been prevented, they said it may have been possible to save both the teenager and her fetus if she had been admitted earlier for close monitoring and continuous treatment.",
      "There was a chance Crain could have remained pregnant, they said. If she had needed an early delivery, the hospital was well-equipped to care for a baby on the edge of viability. In another scenario, if the infection had gone too far, ending the pregnancy might have been necessary to save Crain.",
      "Doctors involved in Crain\u2019s care did not respond to several requests for comment. The two hospitals, Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas and Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth, declined to answer detailed lists of questions about her treatment.",
      "Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn\u2019t care whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.",
      "When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian. Fails could not wait to meet her.",
      "But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency, even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal heartbeat than attending to Crain.",
      "\u201cI know it sounds selfish, and God knows I would rather have both of them, but if I had to choose,\u201d Fails said, \u201cI would have chosen my daughter.\u201d",
      "Crain had just graduated from high school in her hometown of Vidor, Texas, in May of 2023 when she learned that she was pregnant.",
      "She and her boyfriend of two years, Randall Broussard, were always hip to hip, wrestling over vapes or snuggling on the couch watching vampire movies. Crain was drawn to how gentle he was. He admired how easily she built friendships and how quickly she could make people laugh. Though they were young, they\u2019d already imagined starting a family. Broussard, who has eight siblings, wanted many kids; Crain wanted a daughter and the kind of relationship she had with her mom. Earlier that year, Broussard had given Crain a small diamond ring \u2014 \u201ca promise,\u201d he told her, \u201cthat I will always love you.\u201d",
      "On the morning of their baby shower, Oct. 28, 2023, Crain woke with a headache. Her mom decorated the house with pink balloons and Crain laid out Halloween-themed platters. Soon, nausea set in. Crain started vomiting and was running a fever. When guests arrived, Broussard opened gifts \u2014 onesies and diapers and bows \u2014 while Crain kept closing her eyes.",
      "Around 3 p.m., her family told her she needed to go to the hospital.",
      "Broussard drove Crain to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas. They sat in the waiting room for four hours. When Crain started vomiting, staff brought her a plastic pan. When she wasn\u2019t retching, she lay her head in her boyfriend\u2019s lap.",
      "A nurse practitioner ordered a test for strep throat, which came back positive, medical records show. But in a pregnant patient, abdominal pain and vomiting should not be quickly attributed to strep, physicians told ProPublica; a doctor should have also evaluated her pregnancy.",
      "Instead, Baptist Hospitals discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics. She was home at 9 p.m. and quickly dozed off, but within hours, she woke her mother up. \u201cMom, my stomach is still hurting,\u201d she said into the dark bedroom at 3 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of pain.\u201d",
      "Fails drove Broussard and Crain to another hospital in town, Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth. Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8 and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal pain as a seven out of 10.",
      "Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis, records show. It\u2019s standard medical practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the infection was in Crain\u2019s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery.",
      "In a room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain\u2019s belly to check the fetal heart rate. \u201cBaby\u2019s fine,\u201d Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the hallway.",
      "After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain\u2019s fever didn\u2019t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast, medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection, wrote up a prescription and discharged her.",
      "Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case, the board noted that his error \u201cmay have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.\u201d The board issued an order to have Hawkins\u2019 medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two years later. (Hawkins did not respond to several attempts to reach him.)",
      "All of the doctors who reviewed Crain\u2019s vital signs for ProPublica said she should have been admitted. \u201cShe should have never left, never left,\u201d said Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee.",
      "Kass, the New York emergency physician, put it in starker terms: When they discharged her, they were \u201cpushing her down the path of no return.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Fails said as Broussard rolled Crain out in a wheelchair; she was unable to walk on her own. Fails had expected the hospital to keep her overnight. Her daughter was breathing heavily, hunched over in pain, pale in the face. Normally talkative, the teen was quiet.",
      "Back home, around 7 a.m., Fails tried to get her daughter comfortable as she cried and moaned. She told Fails she needed to pee, and her mother helped her into the bathroom. \u201cMom, come here,\u201d she said from the toilet. Blood stained her underwear.",
      "The blood confirmed Fails\u2019 instinct: This was a miscarriage.",
      "At 9 a.m, a full day after the nausea began, they were back at Christus St. Elizabeth. Crain\u2019s lips were drained of color and she kept saying she was going to pass out. Staff started her on IV antibiotics and performed a bedside ultrasound.",
      "Around 9:30 a.m., the OB on duty, Dr. Marcelo Totorica, couldn\u2019t find a fetal heart rate, according to records; he told the family he was sorry for their loss.",
      "Standard protocol when a critically ill patient experiences a miscarriage is to stabilize her and, in most cases, hurry to the operating room for delivery, medical experts said. This is especially urgent with a spreading infection. But at Christus St. Elizabeth, the OB-GYN just continued antibiotic care. A half-hour later, as nurses placed a catheter, Fails noticed her daughter\u2019s thighs were covered in blood.",
      "At 10 a.m., Melissa McIntosh, a labor and delivery nurse, spoke to Totorica about Crain\u2019s condition. The teen was now having contractions. \u201cDr. Totorica states to not move patient,\u201d she wrote after talking with him. \u201cDr. Totorica states there is a slight chance patient may need to go to ICU and he wants the bedside ultrasound to be done stat for sure before admitting to room.\u201d",
      "Though he had already performed an ultrasound, he was asking for a second.",
      "The first hadn\u2019t preserved an image of Crain\u2019s womb in the medical record. \u201cBedside ultrasounds aren\u2019t always set up to save images permanently,\u201d said Abbott, the Boston OB-GYN.",
      "The state\u2019s laws banning abortion require that doctors record the absence of a fetal heartbeat before intervening with a procedure that could end a pregnancy. Exceptions for medical emergencies demand physicians document their reasoning. \u201cPretty consistently, people say, \u2018Until we can be absolutely certain this isn\u2019t a normal pregnancy, we can\u2019t do anything, because it could be alleged that we were doing an abortion,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio.",
      "At 10:40 a.m, Crain\u2019s blood pressure was dropping. Minutes later, Totorica was paging for an emergency team over the loudspeakers.",
      "Around 11 a.m., two hours after Crain had arrived at the hospital, a second ultrasound was performed. A nurse noted: \u201cBedside ultrasound at this time to confirm fetal demise per Dr. Totorica\u2019s orders.\u201d",
      "When doctors wheeled Crain into the ICU at 11:20 a.m., Fails stayed by her side, rubbing her head, as her daughter dipped in and out of consciousness. Crain couldn\u2019t sign consent forms for her care because of \u201cextreme pain,\u201d according to the records, so Fails signed a release for \u201cunplanned dilation and curettage\u201d or \u201cunplanned cesarean section.\u201d",
      "But the doctors quickly decided it was now too risky to operate, according to records. They suspected that she had developed a dangerous complication of sepsis known as disseminated intravascular coagulation; she was bleeding internally.",
      "Frantic and crying, Fails locked eyes with her daughter. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Nevaeh,\u201d she said. \u201cGod made us strong.\u201d",
      "Crain sat up in the cot. Old, black blood gushed from her nostrils and mouth.",
      "Crain is one of at least two pregnant Texas women who died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica found.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn\u2019t required to follow the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don\u2019t turn away patients like Crain.",
      "After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the administration issued guidance on how states with bans should follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The federal law requires hospitals that receive funding through Medicare \u2014 which is virtually all of them \u2014 to stabilize or transfer anyone who arrives in their emergency rooms. That goes for pregnant patients, the guidance argues, even if that means violating state law and providing an abortion.",
      "Paxton responded by filing a lawsuit in 2022, saying the federal guidance \u201cforces hospitals and doctors to commit crimes,\u201d and was an \u201cattempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.\u201d",
      "Part of the battle has centered on who is eligible for abortion. The federal EMTALA guidelines apply when the health of the pregnant patient is in \u201cserious jeopardy.\u201d That\u2019s a wider range of circumstances than the Texas abortion restriction, which only makes exceptions for a \u201crisk of death\u201d or \u201ca serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit worked its way through three layers of federal courts, and each time it was met by judges nominated by former President Donald Trump, whose court appointments were pivotal to overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "After U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, quickly sided with Texas, Paxton celebrated the triumph over \u201cleft-wing bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision last night proves what we knew all along,\u201d Paxton added. \u201cThe law is on our side.\u201d",
      "This year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the order in a ruling authored by Kurt D. Engelhardt, another judge nominated by Trump.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the justices to make it clear that some emergency abortions are allowed.",
      "Even amid news of preventable deaths related to abortion bans, the Supreme Court declined to do so last month.",
      "Paxton called this \u201ca major victory\u201d for the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "He has also made clear that he will bring charges against physicians for performing abortions if he decides that the cases don\u2019t fall within Texas\u2019 narrow medical exceptions.",
      "Last year, he sent a letter threatening to prosecute a doctor who had received court approval to provide an emergency abortion for a Dallas woman. He insisted that the doctor and her patient had not proven how, precisely, the patient\u2019s condition threatened her life.",
      "Many doctors say this kind of message has encouraged doctors to \u201cpunt\u201d patients instead of treating them.",
      "Since the abortion bans went into effect, an OB-GYN at a major hospital in San Antonio has seen an uptick in pregnant patients being sent to them from across Southern Texas, as they suffer from complications that could easily be treated close to home.",
      "The well-resourced hospital is perceived to have more institutional support to provide abortions and miscarriage management, the doctor said. Other providers \u201care transferring those patients to our centers because, frankly, they don\u2019t want to deal with them.\u201d",
      "After Crain died, Fails couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how Christus Southeast Hospital had ignored her daughter\u2019s condition. \u201cShe was bleeding,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do anything to help it along instead of wait for another ultrasound to confirm the baby is dead?\u201d",
      "It was the medical examiner, not the doctors at the hospital, who removed Lillian from Crain\u2019s womb. His autopsy didn\u2019t resolve Fails\u2019 lingering questions about what the hospitals missed and why. He called the death \u201cnatural\u201d and attributed it to \u201ccomplications of pregnancy.\u201d He did note, however, that Crain was \u201crepeatedly seeking medical care for a progressive illness\u201d just before she died.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 11:19:26 -0400",
    "summary": "The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals.",
    "story": [
      "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Pets are not forgotten during Mexico\u2019s famed Day of the Dead celebrations, when even Fido and Tiger get a place at the altars Mexican families set up to honor their deceased loved ones, complete with flowers, candles and photographs.",
      "Though the human dead usually get their favorite food or drink placed on altars, the nature of pet food can make things a little different.",
      "The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals. The small, hairless dogs that Mexicans kept before the Spanish conquest were believed to help guide their owners to the afterlife, and were sometimes given special burials.",
      "But the inclusion of pets on family altars has grown in recent years.",
      "Day of the Dead begins Oct. 31, to remember those humans who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those who died in childhood and then Nov. 2 to those who died as adults.",
      "Observances include entire families cleaning and decorating graves, which are covered with orange marigolds. At both cemeteries and at home altars, relatives light candles, put out offerings of the favorite foods and beverages of their deceased relatives.",
      "The presence of pets has gained such momentum that now Oct. 27 is considered Day of the Dead for pets and the National Anthropology and History Institute includes tips on its social platforms for how to include them in altars.",
      "Mexico City graphic designer Meztli Lizaola makes sure every year that her beloved tawny-coated Chihuahua, Taco \u2014 who died two years ago \u2014 has a place at the altar on a table in the corner of her living room.",
      "Taco\u2019s ashes are there in an urn, and so is his lively-eyed photo, next to a photo of Lizaola\u2019s deceased father.",
      "The orange-flowered cempas\u00fachil \u2014 a type of marigold \u2014 is placed around the photos, as well as candles and figurines of skulls.",
      "Taco was an omnivorous eater and \u2014 as his name suggests \u2014 enjoyed tacos (especially roast pork) and other traditional Mexican human foods like quesadillas and concha pastries.",
      "But because she has four other dogs, she can\u2019t leave Taco\u2019s favorite foods on the altar; some sneaky pup is likely to snatch it.",
      "For years now, elements of Halloween have been mixing into the seasonal festivities, and for pets it\u2019s no different. For those who still have living dogs and cats, it is not uncommon to find a wide variety of pet Halloween costumes at pet shops, including inmate-style \u201cbad dog\u201d costumes.",
      "Ethnohistorian Juan Pablo Garc\u00eda Uri\u00f3stegui says the inclusion of pets and Halloween influences are part of changes in the traditional holiday that have accelerated, particularly in the last three years,",
      "\u201cWe are experiencing changes in the traditions. It is happening very fast,\u201d said Garc\u00eda Uri\u00f3stegui, of Mexico\u2019s National Anthropology Museum. Now it\u2019s not unusual to find pets on airplanes, in bars and restaurants or even at their owners\u2019 medical appointments.",
      "For one thing, especially in big cities, the large family of numerous children is often a thing of the past, and couples having only pets \u2014 dubbed \u201cperrihijos\u201d or \u201cdog kids\u201d \u2014 are now not uncommon.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where you see these practices concerning death starting to take hold,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are no longer just another companion ... they are living beings who hold memories, and whose memory must be commemorated.\u201d",
      "But the admiration for dogs goes way back in Mexico, where hairless dogs known as xoloitzcuintles were common before the Spanish brought their larger, furrier hounds to Mexico during the 1519-1521 conquest.",
      "The pre-Hispanic dogs were often sacrificed or buried near their owners \u2014 or represented as carefully crafted ceramic figurines \u2014 because the owner would need the dogs\u2019 keen senses to find the path to the underworld after death.",
      "Lizaola still feels Taco\u2019s absence. His face is tattooed on her right arm. The dog changed her life and that of her partner.",

      "A New York man who turned a rescued squirrel into a social media star called Peanut is pleading with state authorities to return his beloved pet after they seized it during a raid that also yielded a raccoon named Fred.",
      "Multiple anonymous complaints about Peanut \u2014 also spelled P\u2019Nut or PNUT \u2014 brought at least six officers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to Mark Longo\u2019s home near the Pennsylvania border in rural Pine City on Wednesday, Longo said.",
      "\u201cThe DEC came to my house and raided my house without a search warrant to find a squirrel!\u201d said Longo, who is 34. \u201cI was treated as if I was a drug dealer and they were going for drugs and guns.\u201d",
      "The officers left with Peanut, who amassed hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms during his seven years with Longo. They also took Fred, a more recent addition to the family.",
      "A spokesperson for the DEC said in a statement that the agency started an investigation after receiving \u201cmultiple reports from the public about the potentially unsafe housing of wildlife that could carry rabies and the illegal keeping of wildlife as pets.\u201d",
      "Longo, who runs an animal refuge inspired by his squirrel buddy called P\u2019Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary, took to Instagram to mourn Peanut\u2019s loss.",
      "\u201cWell internet, you WON,\u201d Longo posted. \u201cYou took one of the most amazing animals away from me because of your selfishness. To the group of people who called DEC, there\u2019s a special place in hell for you.\u201d",
      "Longo fears that Peanut has been euthanized. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Peanut is alive,\u201d he said in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d",
      "The DEC spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Peanut had been euthanized.",
      "Longo said he saw Peanut\u2019s mother get hit by a car in New York City seven years ago, leaving the tiny squirrel an orphan. Longo brought Peanut home and cared for him for eight months before trying to release the squirrel into the great outdoors. \u201cA day and a half later I found him sitting on my porch missing half of his tail with his bone sticking out,\u201d Longo said.",
      "Longo determined that Peanut lacked the survival skills to live in the wild and would remain an indoor squirrel.",
      "Soon after Longo posted videos of Peanut playing with his cat, internet fame followed.",
      "A scroll through Peanut\u2019s Instagram account suggests that this is no ordinary squirrel. Peanut leaps on to Longo\u2019s shoulder, he wears a miniature cowboy hat, he eats a waffle while wearing crocheted bunny ears.",
      "Over the years Peanut\u2019s story has been featured on TV and newspapers including USA Today.",
      "Longo, who works as a mechanical engineer, was living in Norwalk, Connecticut, until he decided to move to upstate New York last year to start an animal sanctuary.",
      "P\u2019Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary opened in April 2023 and now houses about 300 animals including horses, goats and alpacas, said Longo, who runs the sanctuary with his wife, Daniela, and other family members.",

    "title": "Big issues, surprise races and ticket-splitting: 5 things to watch in the battle for Congress",
    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The close and uncertain battle for the White House has taken center stage this year.",
    "story": [
      "The close and uncertain battle for the White House has taken center stage this year. But Congress will play a major role in implementing (or blocking) the next president\u2019s agenda \u2014 and the fight for the legislative branch is coming down to the wire.",
      "Both parties only need to net a handful of seats to flip each chamber, with Republicans currently controlling the House and Democrats controlling the Senate with slim majorities.",
      "Senate Republicans need a net gain of two seats to win the majority outright or just one seat if former President Donald Trump also wins the White House, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in the Senate.",
      "In the House, Democrats need to net just four seats to take control of the chamber, and it is possible they could win the House even if Vice President Kamala Harris loses the White House. Control of the House could also be unclear for days, with several battleground seats in slow-counting California.",
      "As the battle for Congress comes to a close, here are five things to watch:",
      "1. Will there be ticket-splitters?",
      "Both parties will be relying on the dwindling group of voters who split their tickets between the presidential race and down-ballot contests.",
      "In the Senate, two Democrats are running for re-election in states Trump is expected to carry: Montana\u2019s Jon Tester and Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown. Both have relied on ticket-splitters in the past, leveraging their own personal brands and appeals to working-class voters.",
      "But Republicans are betting that both states have shifted too far to the right for Tester and Brown to defeat their respective Republican opponents, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy and businessman Bernie Moreno.",
      "(West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is expected to pick up a Senate seat for Republicans easily in his state, where Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin decided not to run for re-election.)",
      "Ticket-splitters could also play an outsize role in the battle for the House, where a slew of competitive districts are in states that are not presidential battlegrounds, like New York and California. There are 16 Republicans running for re-election in districts President Joe Biden won in 2020. While there are some signs Trump may be outperforming his 2020 margins in these districts, particularly in blue states like New York, Republicans will likely have to hang on to some Harris districts to hold the House majority. Five Democratic incumbents are also running in districts Trump carried in 2020, making them top GOP targets this year.",
      "2. What impact could the presidential race have down-ballot?",
      "The race for the White House is expected to have a significant impact on down-ballot races, especially in perennial battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats are defending five Senate seats in presidential battlegrounds, including two open-seat races in Arizona and Michigan. Pennsylvania\u2019s Bob Casey, Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin and Nevada\u2019s Jacky Rosen are also running for re-election.",
      "Their fates could be closely tied to the presidential race. In 2020, just one senator, Maine Republican Susan Collins, won re-election as her state voted for the opposite party for president. In 2016, every state supported the same party for president and for Senate.\u00a0And this year, Harris and Biden have been key themes in congressional Republicans\u2019 closing-argument ads. (More on that below.)",
      "Some candidates, like Casey and Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania, have been trying to strike a balance with the top of their respective tickets by appearing with their parties\u2019 presidential nominees on the campaign trail while also highlighting areas of disagreement.",
      "Several of these Senate candidates, like Rosen in Nevada, have been able to run ahead of Harris, as their GOP opponents have struggled to gain traction. But Senate contests in these battlegrounds have largely tightened in recent days, as the presidential races in these states are coin flips.",
      "These battlegrounds are also hosting competitive House races, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District anchored in Allentown, which is also a presidential bellwether, and the 10th District in Harrisburg, where a former Freedom Caucus leader is on defense.",
      "3. Which issues will win out?",
      "Like the race for president, congressional races have centered on issues that voters often list as crucial to their votes: the economy, immigration, abortion and democracy. But in the waning days of the election, both parties have focused their closing arguments on two distinct issues.",
      "Democratic candidates in the most competitive House and Senate races focused many of their closing ads on abortion, looking to leverage an issue that has boosted the party since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade more than two years ago. Democrats also believe ballot initiatives enshrining abortion rights in some crucial battlegrounds could boost their candidates, even as polling has shown a wide gap between those measures and Democratic candidates.",
      "The second-most mentioned topic in Democrats\u2019 closing ads last week was immigration, as Democrats look to rebut GOP attacks on the issue, followed by health care, bipartisanship and taxation.",
      "Republicans\u2019 most mentioned topic on the airwaves last week was immigration, often mentioned alongside other topics like transgender women playing women\u2019s sports, as they try to paint Democrats as extreme. Other frequently mentioned topics include Harris, taxation, Biden and character, underscoring how Republicans have tried to nationalize these congressional races.",
      "4. Can Republicans overcome Democrats\u2019 massive financial advantage?",
      "Republicans have long been concerned about Democrats\u2019 massive fundraising advantage in House and Senate races. Democrats saw a fundraising boon when Harris took over the ticket, which flooded down-ballot campaigns with cash as she also broke fundraising records.",
      "That\u2019s allowed Democratic candidates to dominate the airwaves, pushing out their positive messages and launching early attacks against their GOP opponents. While Republicans have gotten a boost from outside groups, those groups are charged higher rates for ads, so their money does not go as far.",
      "Nearly $1.6 billion has been spent on ads in Senate races since Labor Day, with Democrats spending $803 million and Republicans spending $758 million, according to AdImpact.",
      "In each of the competitive Senate contests, the Democratic candidate has outspent their opponent in campaign ads. But Republicans have harnessed big-spending outside groups to take the lead in spending in some key races, like in Ohio\u2019s tight race, where Republicans have spent a combined $185 million to Democrats\u2019 $143 million.",
      "More than $1 billion has also been spent on ads in House races since Labor Day, with Democrats spending $615 million to Republicans\u2019 $448 million, according to AdImpact. And Democratic candidates and outside groups have outspent Republicans in 17 of the 20 House races that have seen the most ad spending this fall.",
      "5. Will there be any surprises?",
      "House and Senate contests could also see some surprise results on election night.",
      "One of the most surprising developments on the Senate map has been a competitive race in Nebraska, where independent Dan Osborn is taking on GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.",
      "The race has led to some late spending in the Cornhusker State, with Republicans looking to prop up Fischer as she tries to close the gap with Trump, who is expected to easily win the state.",
      "Since Labor Day, Osborn has spent $9.8 million on ads and Fischer has spent $3.5 million. And outside groups have ramped up their spending since Labor Day, with independent PAC Retire Career Politicians spending more than $13 million.",
      "Democrats have continued to invest in Texas, where Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is facing GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and they\u2019re also eyeing a possible pickup in Florida, where former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging GOP Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "Allred has led the race in ad spending since Labor Day, shelling out more than $50 million to Cruz\u2019s $27 million. Senate Majority PAC, the main Democratic outside group involved in Senate races, has contributed $12.2 million in the race so far through its affiliated group WinSenate in an effort to bolster Allred\u2019s campaign by focusing ads on abortion.",
      "In the Maryland Senate race, Republicans have tried to pull off an upset by recruiting former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan to run for the open seat. Hogan has made the race unusually competitive\u00a0for the typically blue state, but Democratic candidate Angela Alsobrooks has trounced Hogan in ad spending, pouring more than $10 million onto the airwaves, with Hogan spending roughly $3.2 million.",
      "Republicans have ramped up their ad spending in Maryland since Labor Day, thanks largely to the pro-Hogan super PAC Maryland\u2019s Future, which has spent more than $25 million boosting Hogan on the airwaves."

    "story": [
      "MERCER, Pa.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Mercer County has been solid Trump country for the past two elections",
      "Donald Trump won this area in rural northwest Pennsylvania by 25 percentage points in 2016, and by 26 points in 2020.",
      "Yet Democrats here think they\u2019ve got what it takes to trim those margins and play a big role in keeping Pennsylvania blue. In conversations with Democratic activists and volunteers, many noted how they\u2019ve had more on-the-ground support this time around.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "On the one hand, they believe they\u2019ve made inroads with voters who are now quietly backing Harris, or with soft Republicans who have reached their end point with Trump. On the other, they\u2019ve never had so much luck in the Trump era in getting their neighbors to put up yard signs for a Democratic presidential nominee as they have this fall.",
      "\u201cThe fear is gone,\u201d Judy Hines, the Mercer County Democratic Party chair, told NBC News.",
      "Traveling through rural Pennsylvania, particularly in the northwest, there\u2019s little doubt of Trump\u2019s dominance. Trump signs are everywhere, though there is a noticeable amount of signage for Vice President Kamala Harris too. But national and state Democrats have placed renewed emphasis on turning out the vote in these sorts of rural areas, especially in Pennsylvania, as there are signs the former president could eat into the Democratic advantage in Philadelphia.",
      "This strategy has resulted in trips to rural Pennsylvania from both Harris, who made a stop in Johnstown in September, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as well as a bevy of visits from prominent Democratic surrogates.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, national Democrats just kind of wrote those communities off and ignored them,\u201d Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said. \u201cShe\u2019s showing up, and we appreciate that. And I think those communities, even though we\u2019re a big state, they\u2019re still retail areas. And we got to have candidates show up there. We got to make sure that they are getting the chance to meet local folks, and local folks ask them questions, kind of kick the tires a little bit.\u201d",
      "Chief among the surrogates is Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has campaigned in 11 red counties in western Pennsylvania alone, including Mercer. Democrats and Republicans in the state pointed to Fetterman\u2019s effort as notable, even if Republicans doubted it would make much of a difference in the presidential race.",
      "In an interview, Fetterman explained his rural campaign schedule by saying he\u2019s \u201calways been committed\u201d to leaving no stone unturned in the state, though he added that \u201cany credit\u201d for gains in rural parts of the state belongs to \u201call of these small red-county Dems, because those are the kinds of heroes throughout all of this.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Fetterman and Shapiro both pushed Democrats in red counties to put up their yard signs as a signal to others that it was acceptable to back the party\u2019s candidates. In Mercer County, both were able to cut into Republican margins, as Fetterman lost by 22 points and Shapiro lost by 18 \u2014\u00a0both an improvement over Trump\u2019s results two years prior.",
      "But Republicans aren\u2019t worried about any such rural slippage this time around. They believe that anyone who would have abandoned Trump after previously voting for him already did so before the 2020 vote.",
      "They also see an especially receptive audience to Trump\u2019s pitch about the dangers of large-scale immigration and rising prices. And they\u2019ve been encouraged by voter registration and early vote trends in places like Mercer County, where Republicans have outvoted Democrats ahead of Election Day while bolstering their voter registration numbers.",
      "State Rep. Josh Kail, who heads the Republican state House campaign committee, told NBC News that Democrats had a \u201csmart strategy\u201d even if he doubted it would work.",
      "\u201cBut just showing up isn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to have an appeal. You have to have a message that\u2019s going to resonate. And I just don\u2019t see it.\u201d",
      "A Trump campaign official said the Democratic rural outreach effort amounts to nothing more than \u201ca nice bunch of nice headlines and some earned media.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust because [rural voters] get a door-knock or a piece of mail or see 50 million TV ads, it\u2019s not like someone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Oh, you know what? Maybe I\u2019m OK with [a wave of undocumented immigration]. Or maybe I\u2019m OK with inflation,\u2019\u201d this person said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this works.\u201d",
      "'Beating a dead horse'",
      "Just down the road from Mercer in neighboring Lawrence County, a bus filled with Trump surrogates rolled through in late October to speak to a crowd of roughly 100 supporters. The message was hammered home over and over: vote early.",
      "At one point, David Bossie, a Republican National Committee member from Maryland who was a top official on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, told attendees who said they had not yet voted: \u201cShame on you!\u201d",
      "Kash Patel, a former Trump administration official and key ally, pushed voters to have \u201cuncomfortable\u201d conversations with acquaintances who might not be voting for Trump, adding that whether or not Trump wins could come down to Lawrence County.",
      "When it was her turn to speak, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem asked the crowd: \u201cHow many of you could think of somebody right now that you know that isn\u2019t going to vote for President Trump?\u201d",
      "Nearly everyone in attendance raised their hand.",
      "Ahead of that event, Joel D\u2019Alessandro, a Trump supporter from neighboring Beaver County, said he sees Republicans more involved and having a \u201cheightened sense of civic engagement\u201d than in past cycles. But he thinks ultimately flipping any votes at this stage of the game is virtually impossible, particularly with how inundated Pennsylvania has been, receiving the most spending on behalf of both major-party candidates as well as the most visits from each.",
      "\u201cI would challenge anybody to find an undecided vote,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cShort of one of the candidates committing a federal crime in public, out in the open \u2014 that might not even \u2014 but short of murder on camera by one of them, it\u2019s like they\u2019re [dug in]. I don\u2019t know any undecideds. At this point, why bother? It\u2019s beating a dead horse.\u201d",
      "D\u2019Alessandro said he had backed Democrats until 2006 and recalled voting for Bill Clinton. Seeking to reach voters like D\u2019Alessandro, Democrats dispatched Clinton to travel through western Pennsylvania last week, where the former president made stops in Johnstown, Greensburg and Butler \u2014\u00a0all in red counties.",
      "During his stop in Johnstown, Clinton promoted Harris\u2019 promise to make \u201cexplicit outreach to people who don\u2019t even agree with her,\u201d discussed falling birth rates and how rising home prices in Nevada explained rising housing costs nationwide. He lambasted Trump\u2019s economic plan as costing far more than Harris\u2019 in part because he would be giving wealthy Americans \u2014 \u201cincluding me,\u201d he noted \u2014 a substantial tax cut.",
      "\u201cI hate the idea of doing that,\u201d he said.",
      "He also spoke on immigration, promoting the bipartisan effort Harris and President Joe Biden agreed to with Republicans in an effort to solve some of those issues.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump said you can\u2019t do that. \u2018My whole deal is based on division. I need problems. I don\u2019t need solutions. I need people torn up and upset,\u2019\u201d Clinton said, channeling Trump.",
      "Standing on the side of his rally, a man approached the railing and expressed awe at a president standing in the middle of his small town.",
      "\u201cAmazing seeing a president standing there,\u201d the man said before leaving. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "But on immigration, Democratic efforts to pin blame on Trump for the failure of the bipartisan border bill have fallen flat. In Mercer County, at a roundtable discussion with more than a half-dozen Democratic activists and volunteers, each person offered the same answer when asked if that pitch was breaking through: \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoesn\u2019t even ring a bell,\u201d one said of the response they get when raising the episode.",
      "'Quietly getting it done'",
      "Yet even as some interactions have been dispiriting, these Democrats haven\u2019t lost hope. Charles Baldoff, a veteran and a Democratic activist in the county, recalled almost being run over in a parking lot as he and others were promoting the party\u2019s candidates. At the same time, though, he said he hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with demand for signs that read \u201cVeterans for Harris.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel a lot better than I did last time,\u201d he said.",
      "Jennifer Valenti, a Democratic activist in Mercer County, became involved in this cycle after the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and has shared her story of being sexually assaulted as a preteen and receiving an abortion after learning she was pregnant months later. She said her conversations around abortion rights have been particularly impactful in her immediate circle, which does include some Republicans.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of the Democrats, we\u2019re looking at both sides,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Trump\u2019s policies, we\u2019re looking at her policies, and we\u2019re saying it\u2019s not just because she\u2019s a woman or just because she\u2019s Black, it\u2019s because of her policies.\u201d",
      "Mercer County went Democratic in all but one presidential election between 1976 and 2000, but hasn\u2019t been carried by a Democratic nominee in the years since. (Barack Obama came close in 2008 and 2012.)",
      "Ginny Richardson, the Mercer County GOP chair, gave a simple \u201cno\u201d when asked if she was concerned Democrats may be able to trim Trump\u2019s margins there. She said that on the Republican side as well, it\u2019s been much easier to recruit volunteers for local campaign work than it had been in recent cycles. And she noted Republicans had reversed Democrats\u2019 voter registration edge over the past three decades.",
      "\u201cThe country people will put Trump in,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though he won so big last time, we want to win even bigger this time.\u201d",
      "At the roundtable discussion, David Henderson, a Mercer County Democrat, predicted that for all the Republican chest-thumping about the election in his community, the right would be in for a shellacking on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to lose it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re quietly getting it done. I think it\u2019s going to be a landslide in Pennsylvania and around the country. We\u2019ve been quiet because we know that we raise all kinds of hell for Democrats, that we\u2019re just going to bring in a bad light into an election. There\u2019s enough bad in this election. There\u2019s enough hate in the election, and if they\u2019re going to bark at us, bark away. But in the end, we\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d"

      "The final NBC News poll of the election found Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump tied at 49%, using demographic benchmarks agreed upon by the bipartisan team of pollsters trying to best estimate what the electorate will look like this week.",
      "But an analysis of the poll also shows how the composition of the electorate and small changes in who decides to vote could lead to small but important swings in the election. In a close race, that could decide who wins.",
      "The polling team that conducts NBC News\u2019 national surveys, Public Opinion Strategies and Hart Research Associates, looked at how subtly different projections of the electorate, one favoring Republicans and one favoring Democrats, would change the result.",
      "A more Republican-leaning turnout model would bump Trump up to 50% and Harris down to 48%, while a more Democratic-leaning model brings Harris to 50% and Trump down to 47%.",
      "Although all those movements are well within the margin of error, the broader point of the exercise is to show how even slight changes in who shows up to vote could have an outsize effect on the election, if the margins in the battleground states are as close as they were in 2020.",
      "The more Democratic-leaning turnout universe is one that sees more women, nonwhite voters and higher-educated voters turning out, as well as those from the cities and suburbs.",
      "And the one favoring Republicans relies on the opposite: more white people, more men, more voters without college degrees and more from rural communities.",
      "The truth is that in the compressed time frame of an election, a lot of differences from poll to poll can come down to different ideas of what the electorate might look like rather than major, systemic changes in voter thinking.",
      "Simple random chance can also affect one poll or another based on who gets contacted or chooses to answer the survey, though pollsters try to correct for this by weighting their surveys. Indeed, simple and reasonable weighting decisions can move poll results up to 8 points, demonstrating how different decisions and assumptions can affect the picture painted by a survey.",

    "story": [
      "With Pennsylvania expected to be a close and crucial state in the 2024 race for the presidency, it's unusual election laws are again under the microscope.",
      "First, there's the counting. The state doesn\u2019t have early voting \u2014 instead offering the time-consuming and paperwork heavy option of on-demand mail balloting. It also doesn\u2019t process its mail ballots ahead of Election Day.",
      "So, in the hours after polls close on Election Day, when many battleground states will be reporting their early, mail and Election Day totals, Pennsylvania will be counting ballots around the clock in a mad dash to catch up.",
      "Then there's the \"fixing\" or \"curing\" of ballots with minor errors, such as a mail-in ballot mixing a signature. If a ballot has errors, each county in the state decides on its own whether it will let voters \"fix\" them, creating significant differences in voting policy throughout the state. (Most states have a statewide policy for curing ballots.)",
      "And finally, after the ballots are counted, there can be challenges. Pennsylvania laws give residents a spate of ways to challenge and delay certification of the results with recounts, appeals, and litigation.",
      "Election experts say Pennsylvania's laws make it fertile ground for rigged election claims to flourish. They also stressed that there is little reason to believe that unsubstantiated voter fraud claims\u2014and any lawsuits associated with them\u2014will actually stop the certification of the results.",
      "\u201cThe Pennsylvania legislature had multiple opportunities to clarify and improve the state\u2019s election law,\u201d said Nate Persily, an NBC News election law expert and professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIt deliberately chose not to. The gaps in the law provide a vacuum that gets filled with conspiracy theories and require the courts to bring coherence to an incoherent regime.\u201d",
      "Former President Donald Trump and his campaign are already targeting Pennsylvania, falsely claiming there is large-scale \u201ccheating\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud\u201d at play.",
      "Trump's campaign has repeatedly portrayed the long lines in Bucks County during on-demand mail balloting as a form of voter suppression that, according to vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, was \"voter fraud\" perpetrated by Democrats. (The state's Republican secretary of the commonwealth, Al Schmidt, rejected Vance's claim.)",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve already started\u00a0cheating in Lancaster, they\u2019ve cheated. We caught \u2018em with 2600 votes,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally, misconstruing a real incident where hundreds of fraudulent voter registration applications were identified and rejected in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.",
      "This type of disinformation campaign is what worries Wendy Weiser most. As vice president for democracy at the\u00a0Brennan Center\u00a0for Justice at NYU Law School, Weiser said she isn\u2019t concerned that partisans will somehow block the certification of the results. \"Those are not battles that are going to succeed,\u201d she told NBC News recently.",
      "But she fears that Trump's \"disinformation campaign\" and \"broad propaganda efforts\" will \"cause people to think there is something wrong with the election,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge danger that we\u2019re already in.\u201d",
      "Once the results are counted, there are several ways for the Trump campaign \u2014 if it loses \u2014 and its allies to challenge the results.",
      "\u201cWe\u00a0should\u00a0expect a spate of local litigation throughout the state in the immediate aftermath of the election, not because those suits are meritorious, but because Pennsylvania law is rife with such opportunities,\u201d said Michael Morse, an NBC News election law expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law.",
      "State law allows any \u201caggrieved\u201d person who disagrees with how a county board handled its results to appeal them within two days, something that will delay certification temporarily, Morse said in an email. Limited recounts can be demanded by as few as three voters in a precinct, per state law, something that helped delay Pennsylvania's 2022 result certification by weeks.",
      "But the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has tightened the standard for such a recount, requiring petitioners to identify and show evidence that fraud or error occurred, Morse said.",
      "Trump supporters on county boards across the country have sought to block the certification of election results by delaying or voting against the certification in the past.",
      "All three experts, though, agreed that Pennsylvania's courts have tools and legal precedents that allow them to force certification of the results when no credible claims of large-scale voter fraud exist.",
      "State courts have also taken steps to ensure that legal challenges are handled swiftly. The state Supreme Court has expedited its election appeal period from ten to three days to ensure that the state certifies its results by the December 11th federal deadline created by the Electoral Count Reform Act, enacted in 2022 to clarify the counting of presidential election results.",
      "\u201cThe concern to me is less certification of the vote by December 11,\" Morse said, \"than the collateral damage to voter confidence that bad-faith actors can easily inflict along the way.\u201d"

      "Some states \u2014 like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina \u2014 report their vote quickly, while others like Arizona, Nevada and California typically take longer, upward of a week or two to tabulate most of their ballots. Within many states, the patterns of how votes are reported can make it difficult to tell in the middle of election night who the winner is going to be in the end.",

      "A vote mirage is when the current vote count shows a candidate getting a higher percentage of the vote than they will ultimately end up with in the final count. Mirages can be \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d depending on which party appears to be benefiting \u2014 but \u201cappears\u201d is the really important thing here, because like any other mirage, a vote mirage is fleeting and doesn\u2019t reflect the final reality.",
      "The factors that produce a vote mirage",
      "Generally speaking, there are three factors that produce vote mirages: geography, vote mode and order of tabulation.",
      "Mirages can emerge because of geographic differences in the counties that report more quickly or more slowly. It\u2019s common for small, rural counties or precincts to report their tallies more quickly than large, urban ones, because the logistics of counting votes are simpler when there are fewer ballots to handle. As a result, since voters in rural areas are more likely to be Republican than voters in urban areas, a red mirage can happen when a state\u2019s vote count overrepresents rural areas at a certain point on election night.",
      "Virginia is an example of a state that usually has a geography-driven red mirage early on election night. This is because Fairfax County, a high-population suburb of Washington, D.C., where Joe Biden received 70% of the vote in 2020, tends to be one of the last counties in the state to report most of its results. Until Fairfax County has reported most or all of its votes, Donald Trump will likely have a statewide vote percentage that is higher than his final statewide total.",
      "On election night 2020, Fairfax County reported the results from a majority of its ballots (nearly 375,000 votes) at 11:43 p.m. ET. This single report caused Trump\u2019s statewide vote percentage to shrink in that moment from 50.2% to 45.8%. (That\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s final vote share in Virginia, 44%.)",
      "Another factor that can cause vote mirages is partisan differences by vote mode \u2014 mail ballots, early in-person votes, Election Day in-person votes, and so on.",
      "Many states and counties tend to report the results of each mode one at a time. This can cause vote mirages if one party is more likely than the other to cast its votes using a particular mode. This was the case in 2020, when Democrats voted more by mail than Republicans, and Republicans were much more likely to show up on Election Day.",
      "This difference caused a large blue mirage in North Carolina in 2020. In the first hour after polls closed, most North Carolina counties had reported their mail and early in-person votes. Those votes were heavily Democratic, and at 8:18 p.m. ET, Biden was at 57.6% in the statewide vote count. But over the next three hours, the state reported its heavily Republican Election Day votes, causing Biden\u2019s vote percentage to shrink to his final number there, 48.6%.",
      "The third factor that can produce vote mirages is more complicated: differences in the order that specific modes of ballots are counted. This tends to be the most consequential in states and counties that report the results of their mail ballots in small batches.",
      "Many election offices tend to count their mail ballots in the order that they were received, meaning that ballots returned by voters in mid-October will appear in the vote tallies earlier than those received on Election Day. This will produce a vote mirage if there are partisan differences between the earliest-returned mail ballots and the later-returned ones.",
      "This is what occurred in Arizona in 2020. The mail ballots reported by Maricopa County (which accounts for 60% of the state\u2019s voters) on election night included those returned by voters by the weekend before Election Day. This ended up producing a blue mirage, because those earlier mail votes were more Democratic than the later ones.",
      "The results of the later-returned mail ballots were reported in the days following Election Day. Because those late-arriving mail ballots were heavily pro-Republican, Donald Trump\u2019s vote count grew from 46.8% at 3 a.m. ET on election night to his ultimate vote share of 48.9% \u2014 just shy of Biden\u2019s 49.2%.",
      "Interestingly, Arizona\u2019s pattern in the 2018 midterm election was the opposite. Late-arriving mail ballots were much more heavily pro-Democratic, and, once they were added, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, went from trailing by 0.8 percentage points on Election Night to winning the election by 2 points.",
      "What to watch for in terms of mirages in each state",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk accounts for these mirages when deciding whether to project the winner in a race. For example, we are less likely to project a Republican winner in a state if all the remaining uncounted ballots are expected to come from heavily Democratic counties. Conversely, we are less likely to make a projection if the Democrat is ahead but most of the uncounted ballots are expected to be strongly Republican, in-person Election Day votes.",
      "We are also cautious about assuming that historical patterns will hold in 2024, especially given that the 2020 election was held during a pandemic, with voters more likely to vote by mail and social distancing affecting how election officials tabulated the results. This year, the Trump campaign has also encouraged his supporters to vote early, which may affect partisan differences between vote modes.",
      "Here are specific details about the mirages we have seen in key swing states in the past \u2014 and what could happen on election night this year.",
      "North Carolina: Most of the mail ballots will likely be reported first, causing a blue mirage. In a change for this year\u2019s election, in-person early ballots cannot be tabulated until after polls close on Election Day. We expect the in-person early votes to start coming in around 8 p.m. ET, a half-hour after polls close in the state. But the vote percentages will shift toward Republicans as in-person Election Day votes get reported over the course of the evening.",
      "Georgia: Most counties will report their early in-person and mail ballots first, likely causing a blue mirage before the statewide results move toward Trump as Election Day votes are reported. After that, there may be a small shift back toward the Democrats, as the late-arriving mail ballots are reported from large metro Atlanta counties. Unlike 2020, Georgia counties are not allowed to pause their vote-counting process until they have counted all ballots.",
      "Pennsylvania: We expect the earliest-reported votes to be dominated by mail ballots, including from heavily Democratic Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, causing an early blue mirage. Then, as in-person Election Day votes are reported, the blue mirage will turn into a red one, with the results tipping more Republican than we expect to see in the final margin. Finally those large counties (particularly Philadelphia) will continue to count and report their remaining mail ballots. This will likely shift the race back in Democrats\u2019 direction.",
      "In 2020, the Pennsylvania results at 3 a.m. ET on election night were about 7 percentage points more Republican than the final result. In the 2022 Senate election, the 3 a.m. red mirage was just over 1 percentage point from the final margin.",
      "Michigan: We expect a slight red mirage in Michigan as smaller, more pro-Republican localities report their votes. The total vote count will likely trickle upward as small places report, and the size of the mirage will shrink when large, Democratic cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor report. This year, Michigan voters can vote early in person for the first time in a general election, and clerks are now permitted to preprocess their mail ballots, enabling faster counting. Both of these changes may cause differences in vote reporting patterns compared to what we have seen in previous elections.",
      "Wisconsin: In most Wisconsin municipalities, all modes of vote are reported together. This produces a slight red mirage, because smaller, rural municipalities tend to report more quickly.",
      "A handful of large municipalities, including the city of Milwaukee, tabulate their mail ballots centrally and report them separately from their Election Day votes. The state will experience a red mirage until the heavily Democratic mail ballots from most heavily Democratic cities in the state are reported. At 4:42 a.m. ET on election night 2020, Milwaukee reported that Biden had received 85% of its 168,000 mail ballots. This caused Biden\u2019s statewide total to increase from 47.3% to 49.3%.",
      "Arizona: In 2020, about 70% of the state\u2019s votes \u2014 mostly early in-person and early-arriving mail ballots \u2014 were reported in the first hour after polls closed. This generated a statewide Biden lead of over 14 percentage points in a state he ultimately won by 0.3 points.",
      "As Election Day votes were reported in the next few hours of election night, the size of the blue mirage shrunk to about 3.5 points. It continued to shrink after Election Day as the pro-Trump, late-arriving mail ballots were reported. In the 2022 Senate race, the Democrat was ahead in the first hour by 19 points and won by 5. But in the 2018 Senate race, the pattern worked in the opposite direction, with the Republican ahead by 3 points early before ultimately losing by 2 points.",
      "Nevada: Nevada will experience a red mirage until Clark County (Las Vegas) reports. In 2020, Clark\u2019s first report came 90 minutes after the first county in the state had reported its votes. In 2022, this gap was only 10 minutes. Then, the first report in Clark may cause a blue mirage, which will shrink as in-person Election Day votes are tabulated statewide.",
      "Late-arriving mail ballots will be reported in the days after Election Day. In 2020, these ballots moved Biden\u2019s lead from 0.6 percentage points to a final result of 2.4 points."

    "summary": "After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.",
      "The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.",
      "Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.",
      "Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case \u2014 the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.",
      "Approximately 12 hours after Trump declared victory in a 2 a.m. speech from the White House, the campaign filed lawsuits seeking to stop the counts in Michigan and Georgia. Later that day, a third lawsuit was filed in Pennsylvania seeking to prevent voters from \u201ccuring\u201d mail-in ballots that lacked proof of identification.",
      "More lawsuits from the campaign and Republican allies swiftly followed in those states and other heated battlegrounds. In Arizona, voters and the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people in Maricopa County had their ballots disqualified because of ink-bleed caused by Sharpies. In Nevada, Trump electors sued alleging that faulty signature matching machines cast doubt on over 100,000 Clark County mail-in votes. In Wisconsin, Trump filed a lawsuit alleging widespread voter fraud and demanding a recount, which ultimately reaffirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state.",
      "Over the following days and weeks, all these lawsuits ended in losses for Trump, with the exception of his initial lawsuit in Pennsylvania. That resulted in an order finding that the Pennsylvania secretary of state overstepped by extending the deadline for voters to provide missing proof of identification for mail-in ballots received after Election Day and enjoining counties from counting any ballots \u201ccured\u201d during that time. Even with that ruling, Biden still won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.",
      "On Nov. 19, 2020, nearly two weeks after all major media outlets had called the election for Biden, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis held a press conference in Washington, D.C., to present evidence they claimed showed widespread fraud and election interference by foreign countries.",
      "\u201cThe number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "\u201cWhat we are really dealing with here, and uncovering more by the day, is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States,\u201d Powell said.",
      "Powell\u2019s claims at that press conference went too far even for Trump, who behind the scenes dismissed her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d according to filings in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal election interference case against Trump.",
      "The rate of new lawsuits slowed significantly in December, but Trump and his allies hadn\u2019t given up. One week into the month, Texas sought leave at the U.S. Supreme Court to file a lawsuit against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin arguing that officials in those states had made illegal changes to election laws and again raising allegations of fraud. Seventeen Republican attorneys general would go on to add their support to Texas\u2019 case. The justices ultimately declined to hear the case, stating that Texas had not shown a \u201cjudicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, with the exception of justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, never showed any real appetite for taking up other election cases that rose to their level. The justices disposed of a handful of post-election challenges from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with no further explanation in an order a month after Biden was inaugurated.",
      "\u201cThese cases provide us with an ideal opportunity to address just what authority nonlegislative officials have to set election rules, and to do so well before the next election cycle,\u201d Thomas wrote in a dissent. \u201cThe refusal to do so is inexplicable.\u201d",
      "The legal efforts to keep Trump in power had failed, but the ramifications of these challenges would continue to unfold for their participants over the following years. The federal indictment against Trump mentions these baseless lawsuits as proof of his corrupt intent to remain in power despite knowing he lost the election. Giuliani has been disbarred in New York and D.C., indicted in Georgia and Arizona and has been ordered to turn over his Manhattan apartment and other property to two Georgia election workers he defamed.",
      "Powell and Ellis were indicted in Georgia and have both pleaded guilty. Ellis was also indicted in Arizona and has since agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for her charges being dropped. And dozens of ethics complaints against local attorneys who filed election challenges are still pending nationwide."

    "summary": "Some states automatically launch a recount if the results are within a certain margin, while others rely on candidates to ask for one.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 election looks extremely close in the polls. And if the actual results are that close after Election Day, it's possible the results in a key state could hinge on a recount.",
      "The rules about when recounts happen and the procedures they include vary from state to state, since elections are administered locally. Those rules were in the spotlight in 2020, after Joe Biden won a handful of key battleground states by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Former President Donald Trump requested, and was granted, recounts in a few of these states, but none of them changed the outcome of the election there. Typically, recounts only slightly change the final margin of a race, but when the vote is close enough, they can have a real effect.",
      "Ahead of Election Day, here's a refresher of the recount rules in the states expected to be the closest in the presidential race.",
      "Arizona",
      "Candidates don't request recounts in Arizona, but the state requires an automatic recount if a race is decided by a margin within (or equal to) less than 0.5% of votes cast in a race. The threshold was lower in 2020 (0.1%), but since then, the state enacted a law raising the automatic recount threshold to 0.5%.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers approved new measures in 2024 that would shorten the time needed for a potential recount. That means Arizona would be able to handle a recount and not miss the deadline for the December meeting where members of the Electoral College cast their votes.",
      "Georgia",
      "In Georgia, a candidate can request a recount if the margin of a race is within 0.5 percentage points, as long as the request is made within two business days of certification.",
      "Georgia's 2020 presidential vote got significant scrutiny in the days after Election Day, given both the tight margin and Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud.",
      "Election officials hand-counted nearly 5 million ballots again after the election, as part of a statewide risk-limiting audit authorized by a new state law.",
      "Then, after the state certified Biden's victory, the Trump campaign requested a machine recount, as was its right under state law. (That recount also didn't change the outcome.)",
      "State law also allows election officials to ask for a recount if there is \"a suspected error or discrepancy in the returns,\" and the secretary of state can ask for one if a candidate believes a \"suspected error or discrepancy\" occurred.",
      "Michigan",
      "Michigan law provides for an automatic recount if the margin of victory in a race is 2,000 votes or fewer. A candidate is also allowed to request a recount if they have a \"good-faith belief that but for fraud or mistake, the candidate would have had a reasonable chance of winning,\" according to state law.",
      "The state recently enacted changes to Michigan's recount law, but none will go into effect before Election Day.",
      "Nevada",
      "There's no provision for automatic recounts here, but a candidate can request one, as long as they cover the cost of the recount and make the request within three days of the certification.",
      "North Carolina",
      "A candidate can request a recount in a race if the margin of victory is within 0.5% of votes cast, or 10,000 votes, whichever is less.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "The state automatically triggers a recount if the margin between two candidates is within 0.5%. But three voters can also request a recount in a specific precinct if they allege there was fraud or an error in that precinct.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "The state allows candidates to request a recount, as Trump did in 2020. But the candidate who requests the recount has to cover the expenses if the margin of victory is larger than 0.25 percentage points, as Trump did when he paid $3 million for a partial recount that resulted in no substantive change to the 2020 vote count."

      "A win in the election he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe most important\u201c in the history of the country would likely result in the federal criminal cases against him being dismissed, with state criminal cases possibly being frozen until he leaves office and additional delays in the various pending civil cases against him.",
      "A loss to Vice President Kamala Harris, however, could see Trump facing a potential jail sentence later in the month for his criminal conviction in New York and the possibility of additional criminal trials in 2025. It could also leave him open to additional civil trials in the near future, while he\u2019s already appealing $500 million in civil judgments against him.",

      "Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung predicted Trump would prevail at the ballot box and said all of the cases should be tossed. The \u201cwitch hunts against President Trump have imploded\u201d and \u201cshould all be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision on immunity and other vital jurisprudence,\u201d Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the legal cases against the Republican presidential nominee currently stand, and how they may \u2014 or may not \u2014 be affected by a Trump win or loss.",
      "Hush money case",
      "Win or lose, Trump\u2019s biggest immediate challenge after the election is his potential sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York. He is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 \u2014 three weeks after Election Day.",
      "New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan twice postponed the proceeding to give Trump and his attorneys more time to argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling on the scope of presidential immunity should result in the conviction being thrown out. They also want the charges against Trump either dropped or for him to get a new trial that omits evidence they argue shouldn\u2019t have been allowed in light of the high court\u2019s ruling.",
      "Merchan is supposed to decide on that request by Nov. 12. Trump\u2019s attorneys are expected to immediately appeal if he rules against their client.",
      "If the sentencing proceeds, Merchan could potentially sentence Trump to prison, which would also be immediately appealed. Rosenberg told NBC News in May, after Trump\u2019s conviction, that jail time was unlikely but possible considering the former president spent much of the trial insulting the judge and defying his gag order.",
      "An election victory would give Trump additional fodder for an appeal to stave off jail time; his attorneys have argued in another case that the Constitution bars the president from being restricted from carrying out his official duties.",
      "Federal election interference case",
      "If Trump loses, special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case is also on the horizon.",
      "The case, which charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States for illegally trying to overturn the 2020 election results, was initially slated to go to trial earlier this year but was paused for several months while the Supreme Court weighed Trump\u2019s arguments that he was mostly protected from allegations of wrongdoing because of presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to continue moving forward with the case even if Trump is elected in November, but it\u2019s likely that whoever Trump names to head the Justice Department will fire Smith and scuttle the case.",
      "In an interview last week with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump suggested he might not wait for his new AG. \u201cI would fire him within two seconds,\u201d Trump said, referring to Smith.",
      "Even with Smith out of the picture, the Justice Department would still have to move to have the judge dismiss the case \u2014 a request judges don\u2019t always necessarily grant.",
      "Georgia election interference case",
      "The sprawling case charging Trump and more than a dozen others with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results is on hold until December when an appeals court will weigh whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be allowed to remain on the case.",
      "If she is, that could allow the long-stalled case to proceed. Trump\u2019s loss could pave the way for Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to set a trial date for the case. However, if Trump loses, he is still likely to appeal the case further, which Willis brought against him in 2023, which could pose more delays.",
      "If Willis and her office are booted from the case, that would cause additional delays as well. The process of finding another prosecutor can be lengthy; it took almost two years to name one in another case involving Willis.",
      "If Trump wins the election, those delays could be even longer. At a court hearing in December of last year, McAfee asked Trump attorney Steve Sadow when his client could stand trial if he\u2019s elected.",
      "\u201cThe answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\u201d Sadow replied.",
      "Barbara McQuade, an NBC News legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, said she believes it\u2019s possible both state criminal cases could be stayed during Trump\u2019s time in office and \u201cwould resume upon the expiration of his term.\u201d",
      "Classified documents case",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the criminal case charging Trump with lying and scheming to\u00a0mislead federal investigators\u00a0to retain sensitive classified materials after he left the White House, finding Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel was illegal.",
      "Smith is appealing the decision, arguing that there\u2019s plentiful precedent for his appointment and that the case should be allowed to proceed.",
      "As with the federal election case, Smith\u2019s office is expected to proceed with business as usual in the appeal even if Trump is elected, although the special counsel\u2019s office would likely be quickly shut down and the appeal dropped.",
      "E. Jean Carroll appeals",
      "Cases that likely won\u2019t be affected by a Trump win or loss are his pending appeals of civil judgments against him totaling more than  $500 million.",
      "The former president is appealing the largest award \u2014 more than $478 million and growing by more than $111,000 a day \u2014 in a civil fraud case in New York state court. During arguments before the state Appellate Division, three members of the five-judge panel indicated they thought the award was too large.",
      "A lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the award is appropriate because the amount of fraud Trump and his company were found responsible for was sizable and went on for an extended period of time.",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the panel will rule.",
      "Trump is also appealing a pair of jury awards totaling about $88 million that he has to pay writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Carroll filed two suits against Trump, one for allegedly sexually assaulting her in the 1990s and defamation and another for defaming her while he was president.",
      "The appeals court is expected to rule in the sexual assault case first, and that ruling could come at any time.",
      "Jan. 6 suits",
      "Trump is facing eight pending\u00a0civil suits\u00a0related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including by injured police officers. Similar to the criminal cases, Trump has argued that his actions were protected by presidential immunity.",
      "A federal appeals court allowed the cases to proceed last year after the plaintiffs contended that Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t official presidential acts because he was acting as a candidate for the office.",
      "Trump, they noted, would have the opportunity to push back on that stance as the case proceeds.",
      "No trial date has been set in the cases, and with the likelihood of appeals the immunity issues could take months or longer to be determined.",
      "The process could become even more drawn out if Trump wins, because he could attempt to get the Justice Department involved in his defense. He could also try to delay trials in those cases by arguing that they should come after his criminal trial in Georgia, since they cover similar ground and could affect his right against self-incrimination.",
      "\u201cCivil cases are often stayed for that reason,\u201d McQuade said.",
      "\u2018Exonerated 5\u2019 suit",
      "Trump is facing another defamation suit brought against him this month by members of the so-called Central Park Five, who now call themselves the Exonerated Five.",
      "During last month\u2019s presidential debate, Trump incorrectly said that the men, who are Black and Latino, pleaded guilty in a criminal case in which they\u2019d been charged with assaulting and raping a white woman jogging in New York\u2019s Central Park in 1989. He also said they \u201ckilled a person ultimately\u201d although the woman is still alive.",
      "The five, who were teenagers when they were convicted, said they were coerced into confessions by police, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. They were convicted at trial and served lengthy prison sentences while maintaining their innocence.",
      "They were exonerated in 2002 after a review by prosecutors that included DNA evidence that found the jogger had been attacked by a serial rapist who confessed to the crime after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "That suit is not expected to be affected by Trump\u2019s election given a Supreme Court ruling during the Clinton years that presidents aren\u2019t immune from civil suits that aren\u2019t related to their time in office.",
      "McQuade said she believes the case \u201ccould proceed, just as the Paula Jones case did against Bill Clinton.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The task of counting and announcing vote results from over 100,000 precincts across the country \u2014 mostly within a few hours \u2014 requires a massive operation that involves hundreds of thousands of poll workers, election officials and observers.",
      "We may think of a presidential election as a single nationwide contest, but how elections are administered varies across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Even within states, different jurisdictions \u2014 counties, cities and so on \u2014 could have different\u00a0administrative practices or logistics in the election process.",
      "In most of the country, counties run elections. In a handful of states, particularly in New England, cities or towns administer them.",
      "Nearly all of those jurisdictions provide multiple vote reports (updates to the vote count) on election night and in the following days. In the November 2020 election, NBC News received over 88,000 updates to its vote totals across 542 different races. More than 45,000 of those vote updates came before 2 a.m. ET on election night.",
      "From 9:15 to 9:30 p.m. ET that night, NBC News received just over four updates per second, on average.",
      "In all, NBC News will report vote results from 4,635 jurisdictions across the U.S. Here\u2019s how it works, from how local governments count to how NBC News monitors, checks and displays the vote totals.",
      "How do states and counties tabulate their vote results?",
      "The vote results reported by NBC News are the product of hundreds of thousands of people working to accurately and efficiently count and report the results. The process begins at your local polling place or precinct. On Election Day 2020, there were over 107,000 physical polling places nationwide, staffed by nearly 700,000 poll workers, many of them volunteers.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "After polls close in your state and the last voters have cast their ballots, poll workers begin to close the precincts and tabulate the votes. Each state has different requirements for the process, but the steps generally include turning off and securing voting machines and ensuring that the number of voters who checked in corresponds with the number of ballots cast.",
      "Then, each precinct tabulates its vote results and reports those numbers to a central office in its county or town.",
      "In some states, local precincts also count mail ballots from voters who live inside the boundaries of those precincts. Poll workers must scan them through tabulation machines either on Election Day, perhaps while the precincts are not busy, or after polls have closed.",
      "In other places, mail ballots are counted centrally in a jurisdiction\u2019s single facility instead of precinct by precinct. Some of those counties, such as Clark County, Nevada (home of Las Vegas), and Maricopa County, Arizona (home of Phoenix), provide partial reports at regular intervals. Others do not report any mail results until they have tabulated all the mail ballots.",
      "For example, Milwaukee County in Wisconsin released its full tabulation of about 170,000 mail ballots at 4:40 a.m. ET on election night 2020, after it had worked its way through the whole batch.",
      "How does NBC News receive and display counties\u2019 vote tabulations?",
      "In November, NBC News is covering 610 statewide and congressional races. To manage the task of collecting all those results in a relatively short amount of time, NBC News coordinates with ABC News, CBS News and CNN through the National Election Pool, or NEP. Since 2018, the NEP has received vote count data from Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data.",
      "No centralized, federal government agency collects and reports vote results, so each state determines how it makes\u00a0those results available. Many states have websites where anybody can access the real-time vote counts. Others have websites with results \u2014 but the numbers on election night are not as up to date as what is available from individual counties.",
      "And some states do not have vote results pages that update on election night at all.",
      "Edison Research collects the vote results state by state and county by county. When possible, it uses software to automatically detect updates and collect the vote counts from state or county websites. In other jurisdictions, Edison manually transcribes vote result data from PDFs into its tabulation system.",
      "And because many jurisdictions do not post their results online on election night but the results themselves are public information, Edison also hires thousands of \u201cvote reporters\u201d to physically be at county or town election offices where they can get the totals after votes are tabulated.",
      "After Edison processes the data, it is transmitted to NBC News and the rest of the NEP. That is when you will see vote numbers change on a television graphic or on NBCNews.com. That is also when NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk sees the updated vote count and uses it in its process of determining when it can accurately project the winner of a race.",
      "How does NBC News ensure the vote counts are correct?",
      "Given the high volume of data being reported in a fairly short amount of time, it is not hard to imagine that mistakes can be made. Any process that involves hundreds of thousands of people transmitting millions of numbers has the potential for human-generated error from poor handwriting, typos, miscommunications and so forth.",
      "What makes election results in this country trustworthy, however, are the countless fail-safes that detect and correct such mistakes.",
      "The biggest of those fail-safes is vote certification. The results you see on election night are only unofficial counts, and they can change \u2014 typically by tiny amounts, like when overseas and military ballots are added to vote counts or when a state conducts a recount in a close race and re-examines disputed ballots. Only when a state certifies the results, which happens days or even weeks after Election Day, do they become final. And before certification, states require several postelection audit procedures, which double- and triple-check the accuracy of the counts.",
      "On election night, there are other error-detection fail-safes at every stage of the vote counting process. They begin at the local precincts, where poll workers make sure that the \u201cbooks balance\u201d by verifying, for example, that the number of ballots cast in the precincts correspond with the number of voter check-ins.",
      "Then, when a precinct reports its vote results to its state or county, it performs additional quality assurance checks. Does the number of votes in the precinct make sense when compared with its number of registered voters? Is the turnout rate comparable to the rates in nearby precincts? If any of those questions raise flags about a precinct\u2019s count, the state or the county will resolve the concerns by consulting with the person in charge of the precinct or by re-checking the data before those votes are added to the county\u2019s overall count.",
      "Edison Research performs another set of data quality checks when it receives vote results. It looks for errors, like extra digits added to a candidate\u2019s count or vote counts for two candidates getting flipped accidentally. If Edison\u2019s error detection system suspects a report may include a mistake, the data gets held\u00a0until a trained analyst can verify it with the state or the county.",
      "Finally, NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk also has its own set of data quality assurance tools, which compare the vote results to various administrative and historical data sources. If those tools detect anomalies, they are flagged to Edison and the NEP for further investigation. NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk will not call a race until it is certain that the vote results are error-free."

It may take as long as a week for the NBC News Decision Desk to project a presidential winner, or it could happen as early as Wednesday, even by Wednesday morning.",
      "The truth is the Decision Desk cannot know until election night which scenario will unfold, regardless of how carefully we have analyzed the polls, early vote, and other election-related data. The answer depends not only on how states count their votes but on the unknowable factor of how close the margins will be.",

      "Projecting a presidential winner as early as Wednesday would require that the key battleground states, particularly Pennsylvania, are not essentially tied. There would need to be a large enough spread between the first and second place to be able to project a winner.Races that are nearly tied, like the presidential race in Georgia and Arizona in 2020 (Joe Biden\u2019s winning margins in these states were 11,779 and 10,457 votes, respectively), require essentially all the vote to be counted before NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk can project a winner. This can take days.",
      "But let\u2019s go through the battleground states where Wednesday calls are at least possible.",
      "Any path to winning the White House will likely go through the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In 2020, Pennsylvania was the pivotal Electoral College state to call the presidency, and there is a decent chance it plays that role again. But in 2020, it took four days after Election Day for the NBC News Decision Desk to be able to declare a winner.",
      "It may well happen much earlier this year. This is because 98% to 99% of the vote in Pennsylvania will likely be counted by Wednesday morning.",
      "How Pennsylvania counts its vote remains largely unchanged since 2020, but the process should be more efficient this year. Key counties like Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) and Philadelphia have invested heavily in new voting machines and have added more personnel to help process ballots. Also, remember that this election is not being administered amid a global pandemic that required strict social distancing between election officials, slowing the count.",
      "We expect several Pennsylvania counties to release large counts of early votes shortly after polls close, followed by the in-person Election Day vote. That would leave the early votes received on Election Day, along with provisional ballots, still to count on Wednesday.",
      "If 99% of the total vote is counted quickly, a Wednesday projection is very possible in Pennsylvania, unless the race is razor tight. In 2022, we had about 90% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania when the NBC News Decision Desk projected Democrat John Fetterman as the winner of the state\u2019s Senate race at 12:51 a.m. ET.",
      "In Wisconsin and Michigan, the bulk of the vote could also be counted by Wednesday if past reporting patterns hold.Based on those patterns, in Wisconsin, the amount counted by Wednesday morning should be over 99%. In Michigan, it should be more than 95%. An important note in Michigan: For the first time, municipalities with more than 5,000 residents can begin pre-processing absentee ballots \u2014 opening envelopes, verifying voter signatures and so on \u2014 several days before the election, which could lead to more efficient counting on election night.",
      "On the other hand, the introduction of early in-person voting in Michigan could add some difficulty in quickly counting the vote. Regardless of these changes, both Michigan and Wisconsin count almost all of their votes quickly. So, unless the races are extremely close, there is a decent chance the NBC News Decision Desk would be able to make a projection sometime on Wednesday.",

In fact, almost all the vote has been counted in recent past elections by 1 a.m. ET. However, Georgia was so close in 2020 that it took days to call the race.",
      "North Carolina has a similar pattern in how it reports out the vote, with 99% of the vote counted by midnight in past elections. Still, any chance of an election night projection in either of these closely divided states depends on a wide enough spread between the two candidates.",
      "The one electoral vote awarded to the winner in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District could also be pivotal in the path to 270. With no significant changes in how votes are counted in Nebraska, around 90% of the vote can be expected to be counted by Wednesday morning, which again could lead to a projection if there is enough spread between the candidates.",
      "The last two battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, almost certainly won\u2019t be called quickly. If the presidency comes down to one of these states, forget any thoughts of a Wednesday resolution.",
      "In 2020, NBC News did not project a winner in Arizona until Nov. 12, nine days after Election Day. And unlike some other close states, it wasn\u2019t just because the margin was so thin.",
      "Typically, Arizona has as much as 20% of its vote still to count after election night \u2014mainly late-arriving mail ballots. And there are very substantial differences between Republicans and Democrats in terms of who votes when (early versus on Election Day). This makes it nearly impossible to project a winner in Arizona on election night.",
      "Nevada is a state that has a large amount of early voting, both absentee and in person, that is not counted on election night. In the past, nearly a quarter of the vote is still not counted by the Wednesday morning after Election Day.",
      "Given that the state has been historically close in presidential elections, the probability of calling a close race with a large amount of uncounted vote is very low.",
      "The bottom line: In Arizona and Nevada, it will likely take a few days, perhaps longer, to know the winner."

    "title": "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
    "published": "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 13:29:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Exit polls, large-scale studies of voters, now include phone calls to early and mail voters as well as interviews outside polling places on Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "On Election Day, as votes are being tallied and news organizations await results and race projections that can be reported, exit polls are a critical tool providing an early look at who is voting and what\u2019s motivating their choices.",
      "An exit poll is a survey of voters taken as they leave (or exit) their voting location. It\u2019s the only national survey of known voters in the country. It allows news organizations, researchers and voters to understand what\u2019s happening in an election as the results flow in.",
      "Here\u2019s how exit polling works, where they are conducted and how NBC News will be using the exit poll results on election night and the days after.",
      "Who conducts the exit poll?",
      "Since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News \u2014 that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. NBC News independently analyzes and reports on the exit poll results.",
      "Read more election explainers from the NBC News Decision Desk",
      "How the NBC News Decision Desk projects races on general election night 2024How votes get counted and reported on election night \u2014 and how NBC News gathers and checks the dataInside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",

      "How votes get counted and reported on election night \u2014 and how NBC News gathers and checks the data",
      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "What questions are asked?",
      "The exit poll asks voters which candidates they supported for president and in other races. But a number of other attitudinal and issue-based questions are usually included, such as: \u201cWhat is the most important issue to your vote?\u201d The other key component of an exit poll is asking about a voter\u2019s demographics such as age, gender, race, education. These types of questions help illustrate how different groups voted and what mattered to them, and they are also used to weight the exit poll \u2014 that is, to make sure that the exit poll properly reflects the demographic composition of the electorate as well as the election results.",
      "Members of each news organization in the NEP jointly determine in which states the exit polls will be conducted (in addition to the national exit poll survey), and they work together to decide what questions are included on the national and state questionnaires. The exit poll questionnaires include about 25 questions and take around 5 minutes to complete.",
      "How are exit polls conducted?",
      "The exit poll is then conducted in a random sample of selected polling places across the country and in states with their own exit polls (more on that later). At least one interviewer is assigned to each polling place on Election Day. This year, interviewers will be stationed at 600 polling locations throughout the country, with each of them following local rules about where they can stand in relation to the polling location. The interview is self-administered, meaning the respondent fills out the survey on their own. Then, the interviewers call in their results throughout the day, and the results are reported to news organizations.",
      "What about state exit polls?",
      "In addition to a national exit poll, which captures voters across the country, there are exit polls specifically for states that are pivotal to winning the presidency or include important down-ballot races, such as Senate or governor. This year, NBC News will have coverage of state exit polls in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The exit poll will be conducted in 40 balloting locations in each state.",
      "How does the exit poll capture the growing percentage of people voting early or by mail?",
      "The exit poll supplements in-person Election Day interviews by contacting early voters through a telephone poll of people on voter lists in all 50 states, as well as by collecting interviews during early in-person voting periods.",
      "This year, the exit poll is conducting interviews at early in-person voting locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All voters in a given state, regardless of whether they vote early or on Election Day, are asked the same questions.",
      "Are exit polls anonymous?",
      "Yes. In person, voters are handed a piece of paper and pencil to fill out a paper questionnaire and they answer anonymously. When they are done, they put their folded questionnaire into a box, much like casting a ballot. Interviews conducted by telephone do not retain any personal information about the voter who was interviewed.",
      "How many people are interviewed?",
      "The national exit poll will include approximately 20,000 interviews in total, including in-person on Election Day, in-person during early voting and via telephone to capture other early voters, including those who cast their ballots by mail. For each state exit poll in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, there will be sample sizes of 1,500 to 2,500 respondents per state.",
      "How do we use exit polls?",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk uses some exit poll data to help project election results. However, the exit poll is primarily used as a reporting tool on election night.",
      "The data gives viewers and readers a look into what issues are motivating voters, how they feel about the country and who they are. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s first look into what the electorate looks like and how voters are feeling about the election, the candidates and their choices.",
      "What data do news organizations report and when?",
      "Participants in the NEP do not report any exit poll results before 5 p.m. ET on Election Day, and no exit poll results that can be indicative of the outcome of a race get reported until after all the polls are scheduled to close in a state. As election night goes on and interviewers on the ground call in more exit poll results, the data is updated and re-weighed in real time."

    "story": [
      "Election officials \u2014 and reporters like me \u2014 have spent years explaining that voter fraud is incredibly rare. There aren\u2019t millions of noncitizens registering and casting ballots. Voter impersonation is extremely uncommon. And there\u2019s no legion of dead voters.",
      "We know that because voting systems are designed with checks and balances to make it pretty hard to cheat. But most of that isn\u2019t obvious or even visible to voters.",
      "So with false claims of voter fraud already swirling ahead of November\u2019s pivotal election, I\u2019m here to walk you through the basics of the voting systems in three key battleground states \u2014 Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania \u2014 and how four essential elements of our election system prevent widespread voter fraud.",
      "Getting on the voter roll",
      "Georgia asks for quite a bit of information to register as a voter: name, address, date of birth and either the number on your driver\u2019s license or state ID if you have one, or the last four digits of your Social Security number if you don\u2019t. Sign the form swearing \u2014 under penalty of perjury \u2014 that you\u2019re a citizen and eligible to vote, and you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Election officials will then check your information against government databases, which typically verify your identity and citizenship. If officials can\u2019t find corroborating information, you\u2019ll be asked to prove your citizenship with a passport, birth certificate, naturalization certificate or similar document before you are fully registered to vote.",
      "Staying on the roll",
      "Georgia checks its voter rolls against lists of people who have died or been convicted of a felony, while also routinely checking in with voters who change their address with the U.S. Postal Service or cancel their Georgia driver\u2019s license.",
      "They also use the interstate Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) to find voters who die elsewhere, or move and register out of state.",
      "Casting a ballot",
      "You must show a photo ID to vote. If you choose to vote by mail, you\u2019ll have to request a ballot with your driver\u2019s license number or a photocopy of your photo ID.",
      "All ballots are fed into tabulators to be tallied, totals are reconciled (ensuring that there are an equal number of both ballots cast and voters who voted) and the results are driven to the county election office.",
      "Checking the count",
      "After the results are tallied, the state conducts a risk-limiting audit by physically counting randomly selected batches of ballots and hand-counting them. The state also runs all the ballot images through a computer program that tallies the results."

Those two changes are expected to speed up tabulation, but it could still take days to get a full picture of the election results.",

      "But ballot measures in dozens of other states will also put decisions about how to handle marijuana regulations, voting procedures, economic issues and immigration laws directly in the hands of voters.",
      "\u201cThe major trends that we\u2019re seeing in 2024 are reproductive freedom, democracy and economic justice,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works with progressive organizations to help advance citizen-led ballot measures.",
      "Follow live updates on the 2024 election",
      "According to her group, there are 147 ballot measures on ballots next Tuesday in 41 states. Of those, 77 were referred to the ballot by state lawmakers, while 57 were initiated by citizens. The others are considered bond proposals, advisory questions and constitutional convention questions. (In addition, Louisiana will let voters decide on four constitutional amendments on its Dec. 7 ballot.)",
      "Here's a rundown of the various issues the proposed amendments seek to address.",
      "Abortion",
      "Constitutional amendments to expand or protect abortion access will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada and the Senate battlegrounds of Montana and Florida.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows this is a big issue this year \u2014 it\u2019s the most we\u2019ve ever seen for reproductive freedom ballot measures in history,\u201d Fields Figueredo said.",
      "In Arizona, Florida, Missouri and South Dakota, proposed amendments would effectively protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with some exceptions that differ in each state after that point, and undo existing abortion laws on the books.",
      "In Maryland, Montana, Nevada and New York, abortion is already legal through fetal viability, and in Colorado, there are no laws restricting abortion and no gestational limits for women seeking abortions. As a result, the proposals in those states are intended to formally enshrine those existing rights, which organizers have said is designed to prevent lawmakers from undoing them in the future.",
      "Nebraska is the only state where two dueling constitutional amendments will appear on the November ballot.",
      "One measure would amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with exceptions for the life and health of the woman after that.",
      "The other would protect abortion rights in the first trimester, but it would bar the procedure in the second and third trimesters, except in medical emergencies or when pregnancies are the result of sexual assaults or incest. Passage would effectively codify the state's existing law banning abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions, in the state constitution.",
      "Voting and elections",
      "There are 39 ballot measures on the November ballot related to democracy, elections and voting procedures, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center.",
      "Some seek to create or further tighten voting restrictions, while others seek to broaden access.",
      "For example, eight states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin \u2014 will have constitutional amendments, referred to the November ballot by Republican lawmakers, designed to make it clear that only American citizens can vote in elections in those states. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections in each of those states and at the federal level, and it rarely happens. Election experts have warned that the measures amount to an effort by Republicans to drive the unsubstantiated narrative that noncitizens are voting in large numbers.",
      "In Nevada, a constitutional amendment on the ballot would require people to show identification when they vote in person. Under state rules, voters would need to pass it in two consecutive elections for it to take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, at least three states will have measures on their ballots that would make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. A proposal in Arizona would raise signature requirements for citizen-led constitutional amendments to include 15% of registered voters in each of the state\u2019s 30 legislative districts, while another would allow any person to contest an initiative or proposed amendment in court after it has been filed.",
      "A proposal in North Dakota would require any ballot initiative to be solely about one subject and constitutional amendments to be passed in both the primary and general elections to take effect.",
      "In addition, ballot measures in a handful of other states will let voters decide about implementing open primaries, as well as ranked-choice voting, in some elections.",
      "Marijuana",
      "Nearly half the states have already legalized use of recreational or medical marijuana. Voters in four more states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 will decide next week whether to join them.",
      "A ballot measure in Florida will let voters decide whether to make recreational weed \u2014 sold at designated dispensaries \u2014 legal for everyone over 21. Medical marijuana is already legal in Florida.",
      "In Nebraska, where the use of all marijuana remains illegal, a pair of measures would legalize and regulate the use and sale of medical marijuana.",

    "title": "Netanyahu under fire after judge lifts gag order on leaks that may have harmed hostage talks",
    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 12:43:51 GMT",
    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. The Israeli prime minister was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shockwaves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostage families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that the Israeli leader put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hardline position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "The scandal has renewed focus on the issue after the U.S. ramped up efforts by dispatching officials to the Middle East to secure deals that would end the fighting in both Gaza and Lebanon even as the U.S. presidential election looms.",
      "In a ruling on Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that  \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may have not only caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terror attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned, but they have yet to be publicly identified by the court.",
      "Israeli media has reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. The Israeli leader faced mounting outrage from hostage families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "As Netanyahu's office appeared to downplay the impact of the alleged leak, political opponents expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of the prime minister's aides.",
      "In a statement posted to X on Sunday, Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said he had previously warned that \"political considerations had infiltrated the most sacred realm of Israel's security.\"",
      "\"If sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime,\" he said.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that he had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said in a post on X on Sunday.",
      "Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said the possibility of classified data being used by Israeli officials to \"shape media narratives\" should be neither \"surprising or new.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s part of why he is already on trial for corruption,\" she said in a post on X on Monday about Netanyahu, who has been embroiled in an ongoing corruption trial involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust that he denies.",
      "\"The takeaway from the scandal is that Israel is acting criminally, not just regarding Palestinians/adversaries, but domestically,\" Zonszein said.",
      "The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of hostages held by Hamas, said it was unable to immediately provide a response to the information released by the Magistrates\u2019 Court on Sunday. But the forum had previously joined calls from journalists for the gag order to be lifted on the case, saying hostage families had a \u201cright to receive this information directly, rather than learning about it through media reports.\u201d"

      "A tropical disturbance in the Caribbean is likely to become a hurricane as it passes over Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico by midweek, federal forecasters said Sunday.",
      "Residents of the west coast of Florida and other Gulf Coast states should monitor developments and expect at least heavy rain later in the week, the National Hurricane Center said in a series of updates and forecast discussions.",
      "Potential Tropical Cyclone 18 was about 260 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica, the hurricane center said in an update at 4 a.m. ET Monday, and moving north at 7 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.",
      "The Air's Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, using Super Hercules fixed-wing aircraft, got a close look Sunday, the hurricane center said in an afternoon forecast discussion.",
      "\"Their data\u00a0indicates that the system has developed a closed center,\" it said, indicating the storm is organizing.",
      "Still, the upward movement of warm air and precipitation wasn't intense enough to call the disturbance a tropical depression, the hurricane center said. That would most likely come overnight, it said.",
      "Hurricane formation likely",
      "Hurricane center forecasters said there was a 100% chance the disturbance would become at least a tropical depression and a 100% chance it would strengthen after that during the week.",
      "Wind speeds for a tropical depression max out at 38 mph. At 39 mph it becomes a tropical storm, which could happen early Tuesday, according to hurricane center forecasts.",
      "The system is likely to organize into a hurricane, which would require sustained winds of at least 74 mph, by early Tuesday afternoon and remain one when it reaches Cuba on Tuesday or Wednesday, the center said.",
      "But its strengthening could pause as it reaches the Gulf of Mexico, where drier air would work against it, the center said.",
      "\u201cIntrusions of dry air should end the\u00a0strengthening process and likely induce some weakening,\" it said in an afternoon forecast discussion.",
      "By the time it reaches the northern Gulf Coast, it could have weakened to a tropical storm, the center said, noting that there are uncertainties in the long-range forecast.",
      "If the system forms into a hurricane, it will be the 11th of the 2024 season in the Atlantic, Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said on X. Names available for the system include Rafael and Sara, according to the hurricane center.",
      "Storm threats",
      "In the meantime, the hurricane center said, hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours on the Cayman Islands. Jamaica was under a tropical storm warning, which means winds of 39 to 73 mph should be expected in 24 to 36 hours.",
      "The northward storm was expected to move near Jamaica on Monday and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, federal forecasters said. It could bring coastal flooding from a storm surge and heavy rainfall of up to 9 inches, they said.",
      "High surf will also be possible in the western Caribbean through at least midweek, the forecasters said.",
      "Warm water as fuel",
      "U.S. forecasters expect it to shift its north-northeast movement to the north-northwest and enter the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel before it heads toward the Gulf Coast later in the week.",
      "It's still uncertain where Potential Tropical Cyclone 18 would aim once it is inside the Gulf, which has experienced extreme average sea surface temperatures that peaked at roughly 88 degrees in August and remain warm at around 75 degrees this month.",
      "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration experts say storms prefer sea surface temperatures of at least 80 degrees to form into hurricanes.",
      "Tropical cyclones are fueled by warm sea water, which encourages vertical movement of warm air that helps the storms spin counterclockwise as they spit out rain and wind.",
      "\u201cWhen the surface water is warm, the storm sucks up heat energy from the water, just like a straw sucks up a liquid,\u201d according to a NOAA video about how tropical storms form.",
      "Gulf water temperatures have consistently tracked a few degrees higher than average since summer, according to data posted to X by Kim Wood, an atmospheric sciences professor at the University of Arizona.",
      "That might help explain the rapid development and intensity of some of the season's storms, including October's Hurricane Milton, which went from named storm to hurricane in 24 hours, according to NOAA.",
      "\"This explosive strengthening was fueled in part by record to near-record warmth across the Gulf of Mexico,\" it said.",
      "The warmer-than-normal water is an indication of climate change, and it could be helping to fuel more intense and rapidly developing storms, experts at NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency said."

      "BOSTON \u2014 Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to\u00a0battle stubborn brush fires\u00a0across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes.",
      "Hundreds of acres (hectares) in the greater Boston area have already burned in the past week with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state.",
      "In Massachusetts, an average of 15 wildland fires are reported each October. This year, the month\u2019s total capped at about 200 \u2014 an increase of about 1,200% over the average, rivalling the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.",
      "About 100 fire were reported over the last seven days of the month and preliminary information indicates that all of them started with human activity, according to fire officials. The fires prompted some communities last week\u00a0to cancel school classes and Halloween activities.",
      "On Friday, the National Weather Service declared a \u201cred flag\u201d warning for much of eastern Massachusetts. The warning means that the region, which has been experiencing dry and warm weather, is at high risk of fire.",

      "They also urged residents to avoid outdoor cooking and heating and to use caution when using power equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The engines can become hot enough to ignite dry leaves and grass.",
      "Fire officials also cautioned against tossing cigarette butts, matches, or other smoking materials over the edge of a balcony, stub them out on stairs or railings, or toss them in dry vegetation or debris.",
      "On Saturday, a Boston man was arrested in connection to a brush fire in Milford, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. The man was charged with setting fire to another\u2019s land and burning land, trees, lumber and produce.",
      "More than a quarter of this year\u2019s brush and wildland fires took place in October, according to Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The October fires have also accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres (469 hectares) burned so far this year.",
      "\u201cThe weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead,\u201d Celino said in a press release. \u201cAny outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.\u201d",
      "State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said about 45% of Massachusetts homes are in or near wooded areas at risk for brush and wildland fires. Many of those fires have started with activity around the house, like outdoor cooking and using lawn tractors and other power equipment, he added."
