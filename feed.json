      "\u201cIt\u2019s serious, but I\u2019ve started one of the best treatments available (the Nordic protocol), and I\u2019m lucky to be getting absolutely world-class care here in Melbourne,\u201d Szubanski posted.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t sugar-coat it: it\u2019s rough. But I\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m being lovingly cared for by friends and family, my medical team is brilliant, and I\u2019ve never felt more held by the people around me,\u201d she added.",

      "It didn\u2019t occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d he\u2019d be the franchise\u2019s first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d",
      "It didn't occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201c Karate Kid: Legends,\u201d he'd be the franchise's first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d And that gives him a lot of optimism.",
      "\u201cAt first I didn't even think about that,\u201d Wang told The Associated Press. \u201cThat feels like a very cool and actually privileged position that I get to be in.\"",
      "His casting happened, he said, in \"a world where that's normal enough.\"",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d which opens Friday, unites OG Ralph Macchio's Daniel and Jackie Chan's Mr. Han from the 2010 movie to help Wang's Li Fong win a New York City karate competition.",
      "In the original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d movie, which came out more than 40 years ago, Pat Morita was the only main Asian American cast member even though it takes place in California's San Fernando Valley. His beloved Mr. Miyagi helped underdog Daniel wax on and wax off against white karate bullies. That arc has been replicated and flipped in sequels and offshoots ever since. The overall lack of Asian and Asian American representation all these years has been a lingering point of contention for some.",
      "Jeff Yang, author of \u201cThe Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\u201d said he knows plenty of Asian Americans who find most of the Miyagi-verse entertaining. At the same time, even the recent Netflix \u201cCobra Kai\u201d series hardly had any young Asian American main characters. That lost opportunity felt like a \u201cloose, nagging tooth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a situation where the ancient or legendary martial arts master is transferring his skills not just to another generation, but into another community,\u201d Jeff Yang said. \u201cIn a way, that feels like for me as an Asian American, it turns it into a guilty pleasure.\"",
      "The Asians who were there were \u201ceither sidekicks or villains,\" he added.",
      "In Asia, there's a long cinematic history of elite martial artists-turned-actors ranging from icon Bruce Lee to Chan and Jet Li. But in Hollywood, Asian characters who did perform karate or kung-fu often weren't written three-dimensionally. Most of the stars who could shine for acting and on-screen fighting weren't Asian.",
      "\u201cIn a way that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMartial arts is one of the things that was brought to the United States by soldiers who had been stationed in Asia, learned the practice, embraced the lifestyle and the discipline.\u201d",
      "By the 1970s and '80s, karate dojos were becoming popular all over the U.S. in cities and suburbs. So \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d debuted at just the right time.",
      "Ken Nagayama, a martial arts grand master who runs a school in the Valley, was an instructor at a North Hollywood dojo used for scenes in the original film. He recalls meeting Pat Morita. But, he wasn't thinking about casting. He was impressed by how much interest in karate shot up because of one movie.",
      "\u201cWhen that came out, so many people were interested in taking class, especially younger kids,\u201d said Nagayama, who plans to watch \u201cLegends\u201d with some of his students. He had \u201ca whole mix\u201d of students of all races signing up.",
      "Steven Ho, a stunt coordinator and martial artist who lives in Los Angeles and has appeared multiple times on Conan O'Brien's talk shows, remembers Morita, Macchio and William Zabka watching tournaments he competed in to prepare for the first movie. He was such a fan of Morita that he never thought about how there were no other Asian actors.",
      "\u201cPat Morita, to me, he was the lead,\u201d Ho said. \u201cAlso, if that were the only martial arts film out there, then yeah, it would be odd and I would be disappointed. But you gotta remember the \u201880s and \u201990s we were living in the golden age of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, films that featured ... more authentic martial artists.\"",
      "It's a full-circle moment that Chan is one of the mentors in this new flick. Wang is still in disbelief he got to do combat choreography with the superstar.",
      "\u201cHe's the guy you think he is,\u201d Wang said with a grin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn it off when he\u2019s not on set.\u201d",
      "Ho happily points out that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is reinforcing how his 12-year-old twin sons are growing up without negative Asian stereotypes like he did. He\u2019d rather a story have no Asians if the characters are going to be the butt of the joke. That history of stereotyping of Asian men is why he initially declined appearing on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI thought \u201dOh, he\u2019s a tall guy. I\u2019m a short, Asian guy. They\u2019re just going to goof on me. They\u2019re going to go off on me,' so I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m gonna be out of town,\u2019\u201d Ho said.",
      "Luckily, the segments, which have earned millions of YouTube views, were crafted so Ho was the straight-man to O\u2019Brien\u2019s buffoonery.",
      "Twins Jonny and Ollie, in fact, are real-life karate kids. The boys, known as the \u201cTwinjas,\" know karate, mixed martial arts and other disciplines. They count Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon, as a friend. They've appeared on \u201cAmerica's Got Talent,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\" and taught Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg moves. They love \u201cCobra Kai\u201d for the drama and want to see \u201cLegends\u201d for Chan. They have since been introduced to the movie that started it all.",
      "For Ollie, Miyagi was his favorite character.",
      "\u201cI think that in the first Karate Kids, how the teacher was Asian, I think being a teacher is better than being a student,\u201d he said.",
      "Jonny says not every show or movie in this genre has to have an Asian lead, but when there is one, he takes note.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely a lot of other movies and shows that have Asian leads, like Simu Liu, the first Asian superhero,\u201d Jonny said, referring to Marvel's \u201c Shang-Chi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very significant.\"",
      "The Twinjas, who are working on a children's fiction book that's part mystery and part action, are not shy about voicing their own desire for \u201cany opportunities that come our way, we\u2019d love to take, especially for acting and using our martial arts skills,\u201d Ollie said.",
      "Perhaps they'll get some inspiration from seeing Wang in \u201cLegends.\u201d Wang considers it a \"point of pride\u201d if young Asian American children view him as a benchmark so they can see themselves as the hero.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep going back to is it's a privilege,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat I love about this series is ... there's this idea anyone can be the \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019\u201d",

      "Gaulden was released from federal prison in March and sent to home confinement after receiving credit for time served, according to his attorney Drew Findling. With home confinement finished last month, the pardon means he won't have to follow the terms of his probation, including drug testing, he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who were in prison after being convicted on federal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion, were pardoned by President Donald Trump and walked free Wednesday.",
      "The couple is best known for the long-running TV series \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which followed their family and luxurious lifestyle \u2014 which prosecutors said was boosted by bank fraud and hiding earnings from tax authorities.",
      "The Chrisleys were convicted in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks in the Atlanta area out of more than $30 million in loans by submitting false documents.",
      "The pardons signed Wednesday are the latest example of Trump, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.",
      "Here are some things to know about the Chrisleys:",
      "\u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which ran from 2014 to 2023, chronicled the extravagant exploits of the boisterous, tightly knit family of the couple and their five children, from high-end cars to luxury vacations to stunning mansions. It was recorded in the Atlanta area at first and then in Nashville.",
      "In 2019 the show spawned the spinoff \u201cGrowing Up Chrisley,\u201d which featured the couple's children Chase and Savannah living in Los Angeles.",
      "The couple\u2019s 2022 trial started just after E! announced that it was moving forward with a new dating series, \u201cLove Limo,\u201d hosted by Todd Chrisley. It also came soon after USA announced the renwal of \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d for a 10th season, while its spinoff was renewed by E! for a fourth season.",
      "The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 in Atlanta on the fraud and tax charges. Until this Wednesday they still had years left on their sentences: Julie Chrisley was expected to be released in 2028, and Todd Chrisley in 2032.",
      "At trial prosecutors detailed a laundry list of offenses that started before they became famous.",
      "The Chrisleys and a former business partner submitted false documents to banks to obtain fraudulent loans and then used new loans to pay off the old ones, prosecutors said. The couple was accused of spending lavishly on cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20 million in unpaid loans, according to prosecutors. Meanwhile Julie Chrisley created false financial documents to rent a home in Los Angeles, they said, but then the couple did not pay rent on it.",
      "Once they were starring in the reality show, they operated a company that collected their income from the series and other ventures and kept the corporate bank accounts in Julie Chrisley\u2019s name to avoid collection of half a million dollars in back taxes that Todd Chrisley owed, prosecutors said.",
      "When the IRS asked for information on the accounts, they transferred ownership to Todd Chrisley\u2019s mother to try to hide his income further, according to authorities.",
      "Prosecutors also accused the couple of not filing or paying taxes for several years",
      "The Chrisleys\u2019 lawyers argued that an IRS officer gave false testimony at trial and that prosecutors lacked evidence to support convictions.",
      "A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld their convictions last year.",
      "Savannah Chrisley has been a staunch Trump supporter and endorsed his candidacy while also speaking about her parents in a speech at the Republican National Convention last summer.",
      "\u201cMy family was persecuted by rogue prosecutors and Fulton County due to our public profile ... and conservative beliefs,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She has called the case against her parents politically motivated, though they were indicted in 2019 under a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.",
      "In a social media post Wednesday, she praised U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, the Justice Department lawyer assigned to advise Trump on pardons and commutations.",
      "\u201cYour leadership is already changing countless lives \u2014 including mine,\u201d she said on the social platform X. \u201cThank you for standing boldly for truth, for justice, and for reuniting families like mine.\u201d",
      "Todd Chrisley was released from a minimum security prison camp in Pensacola, Florida, in the evening, according to Shannen Sharpe, a spokesperson for his attorney, and Julie Chrisley left a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, Sharpe said.",
      "As Savannah Chrisley waited to meet her father at his prison, she said the family was planning to do a lot of catching up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, Christmases, all the things,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to make up for the lost time.\u201d",

      "Wes Anderson has always been Wes Anderson, but with \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d he somehow seems more Wes Anderson than ever before",
      "\u201cThey say you murdered my mother,\u201d the young would-be nun tells the shady tycoon. \u201cI feel the need to address this.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s something about the deadpan delivery and the clear-eyed manner that makes you sit up and take notice of Liesl, and even more of Mia Threapleton, who plays her in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d (And there\u2019s another thing, too obvious to ignore: Boy, does she ever resemble her mom, Kate Winslet.)",
      "A vivid presence despite her dry-as-dust tone, Threapleton makes a splendid Andersonian debut here as half the father-daughter duo, along with Benicio Del Toro, that drives the director's latest creation. Their emerging relationship is what stands out amid the familiar Andersonian details: the picture-book aesthetic. The meticulous production design (down to those fascinating closing credits). The chapter cards. The \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Hollywood cameos. And most of all the intricate \u2014 nay, elaborate; nay, labyrinthine \u2014 plot.",
      "Indeed, Anderson seems to be leaning into some of these characteristics here, giving the impression of becoming even more, well, Wes Anderson than before. He will likely delight his most ardent fans but perhaps lose a few others with the plot, which becomes a bit exhausting to follow as we reach the midpoint of this tale.",
      "But what is the Phoenician scheme, anyway?",
      "It's a sweeping, ambitious, somewhat corrupt dream of one Anatole \u201cZsa-zsa\u201d Korda (Del Toro), one of the richest industrialists in Europe, to exploit a vast region of the world. We begin in 1950, with yet another assassination attempt on Korda\u2019s life \u2014 his sixth plane crash, to be exact, which occurs as he sits smoking a cigar and reading about botany.",
      "Suddenly, in a hugely entertaining pre-credits sequence, Korda\u2019s in the cockpit, ejecting his useless pilot and directing his own rescue, asking ground control whether he should crash into a corn or soybean field. The media mourns his passing \u2014 and then he turns up, one eye mangled, biting into a husk of corn. As usual, reports of his death have been \u2026 you know.",
      "Recovering at his estate, with some truly fabulous, tiled bathroom floors, Korda summons Liesl from the convent where he sent her at age 5. He wants her to be his sole heir \u2014 and avenger, should his plentiful enemies get him.",
      "His plans are contained in a series of shoeboxes. But Liesl isn't very interested in the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme. What she wants to know is who killed her mother. She also mentions they haven\u2019t seen each other in six years. (\u201cI apologize,\u201d he says.) And she wonders why none of his nine sons, young boys he keeps in a dormitory, will be heirs. But Korda wants her.",
      "They agree to a trial period. We do get the creeping feeling Liesl will never make it back to the convent \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the red lipstick, or the affinity she\u2019s developing for jewels? But we digress.",
      "We should have mentioned by now the tutor and insect expert, Bj\u00f8rn. In his first Anderson film but likely not the last, Michael Cera inhabits this character with just the right mix of commitment and self-awareness. \u201cI could eat a horse,\u201d he muses in a silly quasi-Norwegian accent before lunch, \u201cand easily a pigeon!\u201d",
      "Now it's on the road they go, to secure investments in the scheme. We won\u2019t get into the financial niceties \u2014 we writers have word-length limits, and you readers have patience limits. But the voyage involves \u2014 obviously! \u2014 a long line of characters only Anderson could bring to life.",
      "Among them: the Sacramento consortium, aka Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston, two American guys who hinge their financial commitment on the outcome of a game of HORSE.",
      "Next it\u2019s to Marseille Bob (Mathieu Amalric), and then to Marty (Jeffrey Wright), leader of the Newark Syndicate (we\u2019re not talking Jersey here, but Upper Eastern Independent Phoenicia), who offers a blood transfusion to Korda because, oh yes, he was shot by terrorists at the previous meeting. (Don't worry, the guy's indestructible.)",
      "Then there\u2019s Cousin Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, continuing the cameo parade), whom Korda seeks to marry to get her participation in the investment.",
      "And then back on the plane, the group is strafed by a fighter jet. Soon, it'll be revealed that one of them is a mole. We won\u2019t tell you who, although it\u2019s hard to tell if anything is really a spoiler here \u2014 like the part when Benedict Cumberbatch appears with a very fake beard as Uncle Nubar, who may be someone\u2019s father or may have killed someone, and engages in a slapstick fight with Korda, complete with vase-smashing.",
      "We also shouldn\u2019t tell you what happens with the big ol\u2019 scheme \u2014 it was all about the journey, anyway. And about Korda and Liesl, who by the end have discovered things about each other but, even more, about themselves.",
      "As for Liesl, at the end, she's clad stylishly in black and white \u2014 but definitely not in a habit. As someone famously said about Maria in \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201csomewhere out there is a lady who I think will never be a nun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a Focus Features release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violent content, bloody images, some sexual material, nude images, and smoking throughout.\u201d Running time: 101 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Hawkins plays a foster mother with a secret in the new horror movie \u201cBring Her Back.\u201d",
      "Beware the quirky foster mother who introduces herself as a bit of a weirdo. That\u2019s how Laura (Sally Hawkins) cheerily greets the newly orphaned teenage siblings Andy and Piper in the new horror \u201cBring Her Back,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday.",
      "The comment, more telling than the kids realize at the time, comes after Laura excitedly introduces Piper, who is non-sighted, to her dog. She thinks it\u2019s a good joke to not explain first that the animal is not alive.",
      "The taxidermy is in fact the least weird thing about Laura. Australian filmmakers Michael and Danny Philippou, also behind the teen chiller debut \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d have dreamed up a new nightmare of trauma, grief, resurrection and the deep failures of Australia\u2019s child protective services. That last part is not actually a prominent throughline in the film, but after witnessing what these kids endure in the brisk 99-minute runtime, you too might have some questions about that department\u2019s standard practices.",
      "Many horror movies and stories have utilized non-seeing characters to enhance the suspense. \u201cBring Her Back\u201d strives to make Piper (newcomer Sora Wong) more than a gimmick but a young woman trying to assert her independence \u2014 she refuses to use her cane, which she thinks makes everyone baby her.",
      "Piper\u2019s main protector is her sweet and attentive older brother Andy (Billy Barratt). The film gives the audience a morsel of normality with these two before plunging us into the horror, first with the sudden death of their father, and then with the strange goings on at Laura\u2019s secluded home.",
      "They\u2019re surprised when they arrive to find there\u2019s another child there as well: Olly (Jonah Wren Phillips), who is mute, deeply strange and, when not locked in his room, getting into bloody messes of his own making. If you\u2019re squeamish about gaping wounds and the full surround sound experience of their squishing and oozing, this might not be the movie for you. For those who delight in the crafts behind it all, the makeup and sound work here is truly top notch.",
      "Like many of \u201cBring Her Back\u2019s\u201d genre peers, the occult, nude older men and grainy VHS tapes also co-star in the proceedings. Laura, whose non-seeing daughter drowned recently, is particularly fixated on Piper and equally as dismissive of poor Andy.",
      "While you can probably guess her endgame, the way it comes together is more of the point, and the Philippou twins certainly infuse the film with a fair amount of foreboding before anything truly deranged starts happening. It\u2019s a fun mystery to watch Laura\u2019s strange behavior, which one eventful day includes encouraging Andy to kiss his dead father on the lips (\"it's custom\"), getting the kids drunk and peeing in a measuring cup.",
      "Andy, three months shy of 18, was not originally supposed to accompany his sister to the foster home. But he convinces the social worker to give him a chance until he can apply for legal guardianship. Unfortunately, Laura seems intent on driving him away. He already has lingering trauma from finding his dead father (and other things that will be revealed in time), and now there\u2019s this chipper, tiny woman ready to gaslight him into insanity. Barratt, who won acclaim for his portrayal of a 12-year-old accused of killing his mother\u2019s boyfriend in the British television film \u201cResponsible Child,\u201d is excellent in a difficult role.",
      "Hawkins, meanwhile, gets to be bigger and wilder with Laura, shedding the nurturing mothers of \u201cPaddington\u201d and \u201cWonka\u201d for something defiantly disturbed. She\u2019s also got a few delightfully chilling lines that I won\u2019t spoil. And yet somehow Hawkins is also able to stay clear of campiness and make Laura, unhinged though she may be, the teeniest bit empathetic.",
      "The film doesn\u2019t quite earn the emotional catharsis it seems to be striving for. It\u2019s a little too insane and also underdeveloped, especially Piper\u2019s character, to let the audience in on that level. But if you\u2019ve come for unexpected scares and creativity, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d will not disappoint.",
      "\u201cBring Her Back,\u201d an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome grisly images, language, graphic nudity, strong violent content, underage drinking). Running time: 99 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "A former WWE executive who had been fighting sexual abuse allegations in a lawsuit by an ex-employee has agreed to a confidential settlement and will now help the accuser as she continues suing the company and former leader Vince McMahon",
      "A former WWE executive who had been fighting sexual abuse allegations in a lawsuit by an ex-employee has agreed to a confidential settlement and will now help the accuser as she continues suing the company and former leader Vince McMahon, representatives and lawyers said Wednesday.",
      "John Laurinaitis, WWE's former head of talent relations \u2014 who once wrestled under the name Johnny Ace \u2014 will aid Janel Grant in her lawsuit against McMahon and the worldwide wrestling entertainment conglomerate. Representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis lawyer Edward Brennan confirmed the settlement-cooperation deal and said Laurinaitis has \u201cevidence\u201d against McMahon and the company, but wouldn't say what it was.",
      "\u201cHis agreement to a confidential settlement is a pivotal next step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable and bringing justice to Ms. Grant after years of sexual abuse and trafficking,\u201d representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis said in a joint statement. \"Mr. Laurinaitis looks forward to moving on with his life. We cannot provide any additional details at this time.\u201d",
      "A court document filed Wednesday says Grant and Laurinaitis agreed to a dismissal of the lawsuit's claims against Laurinaitis, but allegations against the WWE and McMahon remain.",
      "McMahon's lawyer, Jessica Rosenberg, issued a statement in response.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s dismissal of John Laurinaitis as a defendant doesn\u2019t alter the facts of this case in any way. Vince McMahon never mistreated Janel Grant,\" Rosenberg said. \u201cNo matter how many press releases her team issues, the truth remains unchanged.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg added that a lawyer for Laurinaitis previously said the lawsuit's allegations were unfounded.",
      "Representatives for the WWE did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "Grant sued the WWE, McMahon and Laurinaitis last year in federal court in Connecticut, where the WWE is based in Stamford. In graphic detail, she alleges McMahon coerced her into sex acts with him, Laurinaitis and others, and she claims both men sexually assaulted her. She says she was made to do humiliating acts during the encounters. The lawsuit also includes photos of sexual texts it says McMahon sent Grant.",
      "McMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. He has previously said the lawsuit is \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.",
      "Grant first started working for the WWE in 2019 as an entry-level employee in its legal department, a job arranged by McMahon, and later transferred to the talent relations department, where Laurinaitis was her boss.",
      "Grant has said she was eventually pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.",
      "Currently pending in the lawsuit are motions by McMahon, the WWE and Laurinaitis to move all the claims to arbitration. They said the lawsuit should not be allowed because Grant agreed to settle any disputes in arbitration as part of her nondisclosure agreement.",
      "McMahon resigned from WWE\u2019s parent company in January 2024 after Grant filed her lawsuit. At the time, McMahon stepped down from his position as executive chair of the board of directors at WWE\u2019s parent company, TKO Group Holdings.",
      "McMahon also resigned as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant's lawsuit.",
      "McMahon bought what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1982 and transformed it from a regional wrestling company into a worldwide phenomenon. Besides running the company with his wife, Linda, who is now the U.S. education secretary, he also performed at WWE events as himself.",

      "Buzz-saw guitars, dense synthesizers and throbbing percussion can sometimes brighten the mood.",
      "That\u2019s the goal of the new album from the American rock band Garbage, \u201cLet All That We Imagine Be the Light.\u201d Due for release Friday, it\u2019s the sound of frontwoman Shirley Manson pushed to the brink by health issues and the fury of our times.",
      "The band\u2019s familiar sonic mix provides a pathway out of the darkness, with heavy riffing and dramatic atmospherics accompanying Manson\u2019s alluring alto.",
      "\u201cThis is a cold cruel world,\u201d she sings on the crunchy \u201cLove to Give.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta find the love where you can get it.\u201d",
      "The album is Garbage\u2019s eighth and the first since 2021\u2019s \u201cNo Gods No Masters.\u201d The genesis came last August, when Manson aggravated an old hip injury, abruptly ending the band\u2019s world tour.",
      "The other members of the group \u2013 Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker \u2013 retreated to the studio and began work on new music. Manson added lyrics that lament fatalism, ageism and sexism, acknowledge vulnerability and mortality, and seek to embrace joy, love and empowerment.",
      "That\u2019s a lot, which may be why there\u2019s a song titled \u201cSisyphus.\u201d The sonics are formidable, too. A mix that echoes the Shangri-Las,Patti Smith and Evanescence helps to leaven the occasional overripe lyric, such as, \u201cThere is no future that can\u2019t be designed/With imagination and a beautiful mind,\" in the title track.",
      "Most of the material is less New Age-y, and there\u2019s a fascinating desperation in Manson\u2019s positivity. \u201cChinese Fire Horse,\u201d for example, becomes a punky, Gen X, age-defying fist-pumper.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve still got the power in my brain and my body/I\u2019ll take no (expletive) from you,\u201d she sings.",
      "Manson sounds just as defiant singing about a love triangle on \u201cHave We Met (The Void),\u201d or mourning in America on \u201cThere\u2019s No Future in Optimism.\u201d The album peaks on the backside with the back-to-back cuts \u201cGet Out My Face AKA Bad Kitty,\u201d a battle cry in the gender war, and \u201cR U Happy Now,\u201d a ferocious post-election rant.",
      "Then comes the closer, \u201cThe Day That I Met God,\u201d a weird and whimsical benedictory mix of horns, strings, faith, pain management and more. Hope and uplift can sound good loud.",

      "\u201cThe more observant of you will notice Phineas\u2019 shirt has one extra stripe,\u201d says co-creator Jeff \u201cSwampy\u201d Marsh. Dan Povenmire, Marsh's creative partner, adds: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t actually gotten any taller, but we\u2019re giving him the illusion of getting taller.\u201d",
      "Other than a fourth stripe on Phineas\u2019s orange-and-white T-shirt, \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d returns with all the characters that Gen Z viewers so adored, including Perry the Platypus, the mad scientist Dr. Doofenshmirtz, the easily excitable older sister Candice and the bully Buford.",
      "\u201cWe were a little worried at first, like are we going to get in the writer' room and just get a lot \u2018No, did that.\u2019 \u2018Did that.\u2019 \u2018Did that,\u2019\u201d says Povenmire. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t been like that at all. It\u2019s been great, fresh, new stories with these characters that we\u2019re just thrilled with.\u201d",
      "The series restarts with Phineas and Ferb enjoying summer vacation, Doofenshmirtz back to his evil ways \u2014 he updates his social media status to \u201cEvil Again\u201d \u2014 and Candace is once more on her everlasting quest to get her brothers in trouble.",
      "\u201cIsn't it great? It's like old times,\u201d says Doofenshmirtz.",
      "The first two episodes of the 40 ordered air June 5 on Disney Channel and Disney XD, while the first full batch of 10 episodes will premiere on Disney+ starting June 6.",
      "The decision to restart the series was a no-brainer. According to Disney internal streaming data, the show has been streamed some 650 million hours on Disney+ globally to date. According to Nielsen, \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d is among the top 10 most-watched animated kids series on streaming platforms despite not offering new episodes in 10 years.",
      "The show \u2014 which had four seasons between 2007 and 2015 \u2014 centers on the titular stepbrothers \u2014 the triangular- headed Phineas and the quiet Ferb \u2014 who stave off boredom by turning their backyard into things like ski resorts, surfing beaches or monster truck rallies.",
      "Unbeknownst to the pair, Perry, their mute pet platypus, is a secret government agent code-named P who regularly dons a hat and trench coat to save the world from Doofenshmirtz, voiced by Povenmire.",
      "The show is pitched to both kids and adults, mixing references to Nietzsche and Girl Scouts. Each episode also includes an original \u2014 often very catchy \u2014 song, written by Povenmire and Marsh. (\u201cSquirrels In My Pants\u201d is a proven winner.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that the whole family can enjoy together,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cWe made a commitment never to cut anything just because somebody said it was too smart. We just believed kids are smarter than you think.\u201d",
      "The idiosyncratic show had a hard birth, created in 1993 but not airing until 2007. Povenmire and Marsh, both veterans of shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d hit it off and stuck with their vision.",
      "\u201cWhenever anybody would ask us to pitch them something, we would always dust this off and say, \u2018Well, here\u2019s the show we really want.\u2019 And most of the time people were just like, \u2018I think it\u2019s too complicated,\u2019\u201d says Povenmire.",
      "The creators insisted on using no double entendres, took out mean humor and refused to make the moms and dads idiots. Even the so-called villains \u2014 Candace and Doofenshmirtz \u2014 are good, deep down.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get a laugh, shocking somebody or putting somebody down are the two easiest, cheapest laughs to get,\u201d says Povenmire. \u201cWe\u2019d made this decision to make it nicer than the shows that we had seen on the air at the time.\u201d",
      "The show has been a magnet for celebrity cameos and the upcoming season is no different, with Michael Bubl\u00e9, John Stamos, \u201cTed Lasso\u201d stars Brendan Hunt and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez, Alan Cumming, Leslie Jones, Anna Faris, Megan Rapinoe, Meghan Trainor and Ruth Negga all making guest spots.",
      "Phineas and Ferb's penchant for building things like a submarine sandwich submarine or a vaporizer machine has over the years had an unintended effect \u2014 inspiring a generation of engineers.",

      "Marsh recalls the first time he realized that he and Povenmire had a hit on their hands. He was with his child at an outdoor skating rink in Santa Monica early in the show's run when a little girl came skating by, singing their song \u201cS\u2019Winter,\u201d a mashup of summer and winter (One lyric goes: \u201cYou can freeze while you get tan\u201d),",

      "Matt Berninger's brooding, droning baritone is difficult to separate from The National's alt-rock brand of upbeat electric-guitar escape from minor-key plunges into the life's depths",
      "Matt Berninger's brooding, droning baritone is difficult to separate from The National.",
      "His second solo album, \u201cGet Sunk,\u201d doesn't diverge much from the alt-rock band he's fronted for more than a quarter-century. And why should it?",
      "The National's sad-dad brand exists in the bittersweet spot between Berninger's complex lyrics and a melodic versatility. And \"Get Sunk\u201d sounds more like an extension of the band's catalog than a self-serving experiment for a restless songwriter.",
      "It works on both levels \u2014 with the album's familiar, upbeat electric guitar-escapes.",
      "But when compared to his band's repertoire, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d runs out of steam. Even with his consistently clever lyrics, a couple of lethargic songs can drag down a 10-track lineup.",
      "The record arrives a few years after a struggle with pandemic-driven depression, as he detailed in an interview with David Letterman. Berninger was hit by a bad case of writer\u2019s block after his first solo record, \u201cSerpentine Prison,\u201d came out in 2020.",
      "The National\u2019s release of two new albums five months apart in 2023, after a four-year hiatus, helped thaw some of Berninger's frozen creativity. His family moved from California to Connecticut that year, too, further aiding his reset; he began reading and painting in the fresh air.",
      "On \u201cGet Sunk,\" the third track, \u201cBonnet of Pins,\u201d brings a hard edge, evoking the band's \u201cThe System Only Dreams in Total Darkness\u201d record from 2017. \u201cGet Sunk\u201d producer Sean O'Brien cranks on the guitar. Drummer Sterling Laws does his best impression of The National stalwart Bryan Devendorf. Julia Laws, whose indie rock band Ronboy has been touring with Berninger, sings backup on this smoky, stressful encounter with an ex-lover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cup trick shell game, it\u2019s a puff of smoke/And it gets me every time, it\u2019s a pretty good joke,\u201d Berninger sings. \u201cI know that you miss me, I know that you miss me/This stuff takes a lifetime.\u201d",
      "With the infectious opener \u201cInland Ocean\u201d bursting with a reverbed guitar that pulsates throughout the song, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d gets revved up right away. Even on the downbeat \u201cNowhere Special,\" Berninger is at his songwriting best ambling through a rant about an on-again, off-again relationship: \u201cA bat can haul our recording equipment into the woods/I know we shouldn\u2019t but I feel like we should.\u201d The closer, \u201cTimes of Difficulty,\u201d is tailor-made for a live-show singalong with the chant \u201cGet drunk! Get sunk! Forget! Get wet!\u201d that marks Berninger's search for clarity and creativity.",
      "Much like The National's 2019 album \u201cI Am Easy to Find,\u201d which brought in several women to pair vocals with his gravelly baritone, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d follows suit. Laws sings on eight of the 10 tracks, and Meg Duffy of the band Hand Habits joins Berninger on the sentimental \u201cFrozen Oranges.\"",
      "The sleepiness of \u201cFrozen Oranges\u201d is also the first warning there's just not enough energy to cover a whole album, not quite enough strength for \u201cGet Sunk\u201d to swim on its own. Berninger will be forever intertwined with The National, a connection there's no need to undo.",

      "So seemingly aligned in sensibility and style are Cera and Anderson that you could easily imagine a whole fake filmography. It is, for a slightly more corduroyed corner of the movie world, an actor-director pairing as destined as Scorsese and De Niro \u2014 even if \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is (checks notes one last time) their first movie together.",

      "Cera plays Liesl\u2019s Norwegian tutor Bj\u00f8rn Lund. And because of the strong leading performances, you couldn\u2019t quite say Cera steals the show, he\u2019s certainly one of the very best things about \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" \u2014 and that's something for a movie that includes Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston playing a game of HORSE. Bj\u00f8rn is an entomologist, which means Cera spends a sizable portion of the movie in a bow tie with an insect gently poised on his finger.",
      "\u201cHe is sort of a bug, himself,\u201d Cera, speaking in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival shortly before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d says with a wry smile. \u201cAnd he sheds his skin and becomes his truth self.\u201d",
      "If Cera\u2019s role in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d feels like a long time coming, it is. He and Anderson first met more than 15 years ago. Cera, 36, was then coming off his early breakthroughs in \u201cArrested Development,\u201d \u201cSuperbad\u201d and \u201cJuno.\u201d A comic wunderkind from Ontario who stood out even among the \u201cArrested Development\u201d cast as a teenager, Cera had caught Anderson\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cIt was something arranged by an agent in New York and we went to a kind of cocktail party,\u201d Anderson recalls by phone. \u201cWe were with Harvey Keitel, too. So it was me and Harvey and Michael Cera \u2014 a totally unexpected combination. But I loved him. For years I\u2019ve kind of felt like: Why haven\u2019t we already done something together?\u201d",
      "For Cera, the meeting was even more memorable.",
      "\u201cI remember being very excited to meet him,\" Cera says. \"I remember him being very disarming. Obviously, he was like a luminary inspiration. He has had a huge impact on my general sense of taste. I discovered his movies when I was a teenager and watched them over and over.\u201d",
      "They nearly did come together on a movie before \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d Anderson had a small role for Cera in \u201cAsteroid City,\u201d but when its production schedule got pushed, Cera had to drop out because of the coming due date for his first son with his wife Nadine.",
      "\u201cI was kind of worried that I blew it,\" says Cera, \u201cthat I missed the chance to sneak in.\u201d",
      "But even though Anderson and Cera didn\u2019t work together until \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d they developed a relationship. Cera, who aspires to write and direct his own films, would send Anderson scripts for feedback. \u201cWe became friends,\u201d says Cera.",
      "\u201cIn the case of this movie, it was everything short of written for him,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAs soon as we had the idea of the character, he was the guy who (cowriter Roman Coppola) and I started talking about. I think we talked to him about it before there was a script or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seemed like it had already happened,\u201d adds Anderson. \u201cAnd it was a very good fit, a natural thing.\u201d",
      "Cera quickly adapted to Anderson\u2019s unique style of moviemaking, in which the cast collectively stay at a hotel, begin the morning in makeup together and remain on set without trailers to retreat to. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re kind of exhausted,\u201d says Cera. \u201cAt the end of the first day, you go: OK, I need to eat a bigger breakfast.\u201d As the production went along, Cera often sat right next to Anderson to watch him work.",
      "One very notable characteristic of Bj\u00f8rn is a Norwegian accent. If there\u2019s anything more fitting than Michael Cera being a Wes Anderson movie, it might be Michael Cera doing a Norwegian accent in a Wes Anderson movie. It\u2019s also a bit that, in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d has a touch of spoiler to it. Cera calls it \u201csort of a jaunty, playful representation of an accent, not purporting to be a home run.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I brought up the accent to Wes, I said, \u2018How should we go about this accent?\u2019\u201d Cera say. \u201cHe was kind of caught of guard. I think he hears the movie in his head and maybe hadn\u2019t figured that in. It was something Wes had to compute.\u201d",
      "As Anderson describes it, Cera was determined. \u201cI, at a certain point, was a little reluctant, like, I don\u2019t know if we need it,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, let me show you what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d",
      "A determination in absurdism has long marked Cera's best performances. Though a private person who has resisted all urges to get a smartphone, Cera is remarkably fearless when it comes to the most awkward moments. It\u2019s a seriousness of purpose that, whether singing \u201cThese Eyes\u201d in \u201cSuperbad\u201d or waving hello as Allen in \u201cBarbie,\u201d that's made Cera a favorite of successive generations. Even in a billion-dollar blockbuster, Cera can be unassumingly hilarious.",
      "\u201cI feel like most people don\u2019t know I\u2019m in that movie. I mean, not a in a bad way. It was great for my personal disposition to get to be part of it,\u201d Cera says. \u201cI can say I\u2019m in it, but I can walk around. I\u2019m nowhere near the center of the movie. I\u2019m not on the poster, put it that way. (Laughs) My nephew went and saw the movie with my sister. Afterwards he was like, \u2018I thought Uncle Michael was going to be in this movie.\u2019 It was a nice lane for me.\u201d",
      "Just before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d in Cannes, it was announced that Cera, after writing a handful of scripts including an adaptation of Charles Portis\u2019 \u201cMasters of Atlantis,\u201d will make his directorial debut with \u201cLove Is Not the Answer,\u201d a film he wrote that has a cast including Pamela Anderson and Steve Coogan.",
      "\u201cYou have a little more control over your destiny if you try to create something, even though it\u2019s hard to get it off the ground,\u201d Cera says. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than sitting around. You\u2019re like a hired contractor as an actor, and it\u2019s a great thing about it. But I think a lot of actors end up becoming frustrated directors because of how many opinions you have about the proceedings.\u201d",
      "It may have taken many years for Cera and Anderson to finally team up, but it could have come at the right time, just as Cera is \u2014 ahem \u2014 shedding a skin. In any case, theirs remains an ongoing collaboration. Anderson tapped Cera for an ad they recently shot for Mont Blanc. Does that mean he's officially part of the troupe?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up to him,\" says Cera. \u201cI would never say no.\u201d",

      "Dolly Parton says her faith has carried her through her fluctuating grief following the death of her husband, Carl Dean",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dolly Parton\u2019s angelic voice floated throughout her first gospel album in 1971 with songs like \u201cI Believe,\u201d \u201cLord Hold My Hand\u201d and the album\u2019s title track, \u201cGolden Streets of Glory.\u201d The entertainment icon says the same steadfast faith that inspired those hymns have anchored her throughout her grief following the death her husband, Carl Dean.",
      "\u201cI am a person of faith, and I truly believe that I\u2019m going to see him again someday. And I see him every day in my memories and in my heart, and in all the things that we used to do and all the things that we\u2019ve built together,\u201d said Parton. \u201cYou just kind of have to learn to kind of make new plans \u2014 but that\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honoree reflected on her marriage of nearly 60 years while promoting her new single-serve Southern-inspired frozen meals, following her popular Duncan Hines baking mixes via a collaboration with US-based Conagra Brands. Dean, who avoided the spotlight and inspired her timeless hit \u201cJolene,\u201d as well as her 2023 \u201cRockstar\u201d album, died in March at 82.",
      "\u201cI really feel his presence,\u201d said the 10-time Grammy winner. \u201cI just try to go on, because I know I have to. And he was ill for quite a while, and part of me was at peace that he was at peace and not suffering anymore. But that still doesn\u2019t make up for the loss and the loneliness of it.\u201d",
      "The 79-year-old recording artist spoke with The Associated Press about her perspective on life without her husband, her entrepreneurial spirit and on why she\u2019s never embraced the title \u201csuperstar.\u201d The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "PARTON: No, I just think that I\u2019ve always had dreams and I\u2019m always working. My husband understood that. Carl knew that better than anybody and he was all about it. He was very proud of me. \u2026 So when I did lose him, I just thought, well, I\u2019m going to take all of that energy, and I'm just going to put that back into other things, and I\u2019ll keep him ever-present in everything that I do.",
      "PARTON: I just think that if you\u2019re successful, if you are lucky enough to see your dreams come true, you need to make new dreams out of your other dreams. Because it\u2019s like a tree with lots of limbs and leaves, so every dream, you can kind of branch off \u2014 if you\u2019ll pardon the expression \u2014 and do other things. And I like the business end of things. I like seeing things happen, and I love making things happen. So, my mind just naturally works that way.",
      "PARTON: I have a new book coming out ... this one is called \u2018Star of the Show,\u2019 which is actually a song I wrote years ago. But it\u2019s about my life on the road and my life on stage \u2014 all the behind the scenes and all the people that I\u2019ve met, and all of the things that happen when you\u2019re traveling like that as I have for all of these years. So, that, and then I have my life story as a musical. It\u2019s called \u2018Dolly: An Original Musical.\u2019 And I\u2019ve written a lot of original songs for it. Of course, it\u2019ll have the big hits that are woven into the story. And it\u2019s just about my life, from the time I was little until up through now.",
      "It\u2019s going to be at the Fisher Center of Performing Arts at Belmont University (in Nashville). Then, once that has its run through the end of August, then we take it to New York to open on Broadway next year.",
      "PARTON: One of the things they did for the 40th anniversary was put a big sign up on the hill there above Dollywood that says \u201cDollywood\u201d like the Hollywood sign. \u2026 Years ago, when I thought, \u2018Well, someday I\u2019m going to have my own theme park and I\u2019m gonna change that H to a D and have Dollywood.' So, they finally, after 40 years, put that sign up, even though I\u2019ve talked about it for years. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of wonderful things planned for the whole season that\u2019s celebrating the 40th anniversary. It seems just like a few years back, but it\u2019s like everything else: I was with Carl for 60 years, and Dollywood\u2019s 40 years old. And that\u2019s just hard to believe because I\u2019m only 27. (laughs)",
      "PARTON: I don\u2019t think about my life in terms of \u2018superstar.\u2019 I\u2019m just a workin\u2019 girl. I always say \u2014 and it\u2019s the truth \u2014 that I am a workhorse that looks like a show horse. But I gotta keep it all up and I enjoy all of it. \u2026 My husband always said, \u2018If anybody was ever born to be a star, it\u2019s you.\u2019 Because he sees me loving to do all the things and playing and stuff \u2014 it\u2019s play time for me. But I take it very serious.",

      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic",
      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic. So the fact that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d has nothing to say is all the more disappointing.",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the original \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and its early sequels is Mr. Miyagi\u2019s radical proclivity for mercy, often mistaken for cowardice by those around him. He doesn\u2019t just teach Daniel (Ralph Macchio) how to fight. He teaches him a subversive way of living, and, in doing so, becomes a kind of father figure to the fatherless boy.",
      "As is often the case, it seems the spirit of the franchise was lost somewhere in the creation of an entire universe \u2014 including six films and six seasons of \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d Although \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d does eventually allude to this philosophy of compassion, it lacks both the heart and grit of those earlier films. It\u2019s neither entertaining, nor thought-provoking, which makes one wonder whether this was solely a means of capitalizing on the renewed audience the franchise boasts thanks to \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the film follows the playbook of its predecessors. Li Fong (Ben Wang) moves to New York from Beijing with his mother and deals with the clashing of cultures and the struggles of being an outsider. And while Li does eventually, like in previous films, fight the jealous ex-boyfriend of his new romantic interest, their rivalry is hardly the focal point of the story.",
      "Instead, Li\u2019s main struggle is internal, as he deals with the grief of witnessing his brother get fatally stabbed by a disgruntled opponent after a kung fu match back home. But even that internal struggle is buried under other subplots and is hardly dealt with in the end.",
      "You might be wondering how Macchio and Jackie Chan fit into this story. They are, after all, on the movie poster. But neither is meaningfully in the film until about an hour into it, when they decide they need to help Li prepare for his karate match. Chan starred as a kung fu master in the 2010 remake, and the impressively choreographed fight scenes in this movie are more akin to his previous film \u2014 the convergence between Macchio's karate and Chan's kung fu is never really fleshed out.",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is the first project in the franchise to connect Chan and Macchio, and does so in a way that feels forced. Once Chan and Macchio are finally on screen, there are a few endearing moments between the pair. But not enough to save the film. The attempt to tell a different story, while laudable, turns the film into a convoluted one, with no real character development or stakes.",
      "Part of the problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously, making some of the irreverent humor of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d unattainable. (One of the best moments of the film is William Zabka\u2019s cameo as Johnny Lawrence in a light-hearted coda.) For the most part, the film struggles tonally, thanks in part to the upbeat music set against a backdrop of violence and trauma.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the previous films haven\u2019t always suffered from trying to do too many things. But there were moments of poignancy in the earlier movies that are absent in this latest installment of the franchise.",
      "Despite its sprawling universe, there's no need to have kept up with it to understand most of what's going on. But rewatching the first wouldn't hurt, even if it will make you nostalgic for what's missing in \u201cKarate Kid: Legends.\u201d",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for martial arts violence and some language. Running time: 94 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cMusic will return to the beaches,\u201d said Julio Trindade, who works as a DJ in the kiosks and campaigned against the measure. \u201c Rio\u2019s beaches are known worldwide and they deserve a soundtrack.\u201d",

      "Iran has summoned France\u2019s representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime\u2019s oppression.\u201d",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has summoned France's representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had praised \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d after it won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Iranian film centers on a man who abducts his suspected captor after being tortured in prison.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the French charge d\u2019affaires was summoned over the minister\u2019s \u201cinterventionist, irresponsible and instigative allegations,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "\u201cSpare us Iranians the lectures. You have no moral authority whatsoever,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on \u201cX,\u201d citing France's approach to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. France last week threatened \u201cconcrete action\u201d against Israel if the country didn't halt the offensive in Gaza and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, but the statement was mostly dismissed as empty threats.",
      "Immediately following the award's announcement, the Iranian state news agency had announced a more muted celebration of the award, crediting the country\u2019s film industry for winning a second Palme d\u2019Or after Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1997 drama, \u201cTaste of Cherry.\"",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won\u2019t allow him to make the films he wants to, and \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was filmed without cooperation. Iranian state TV called the film a mixture of \u201clie and smearing\u201d as well as an \u201cunderground\u201d film produced without required permits in Iran. State TV also chastised Panahi for not mentioning the plight of the Palestinians in his acceptance speech.",
      "The film follows a man named Vahid, played by Vahid Mobasser, who believes he sees his former captor, who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In a strange and emotional journey, they are all forced to grapple with revenge and forgiveness. Panahi drew on the experiences from his own imprisonment as well as the stories of detainees around him.",
      "Other state media were more critical of the win. The Mizan news agency, an arm of the country\u2019s judiciary, reported on the win as part of the \u201cPolitical Cannes Film Festival,\u201d suggesting that the prize was given to Panahi because of his political leanings.",
      "Pro-reform media outlets and activists praised Panahi. \u201cThis victory is no accident \u2014 it is the result of a tireless dedication to exploring humanistic values and human rights,\u201d said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was also previously imprisoned at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. Inmates at the prison include those with Western ties and political prisoners.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in anti-government protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "Panahi was arrested in 2022 when he went to the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve six years for an earlier sentence on charges of propagandizing against the government from 2011 that had never been enforced. In early 2023, Panahi went on a hunger strike and was released from Evin Prison.",
      "Panahi said he would not seek asylum in another country, despite the risks of additional imprisonment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he said last week from the Cannes festival. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Panahi landed in Tehran to cheers and applause from fans.",

      "King Charles III arrives in Ottawa on Monday to underscore Canada\u2019s sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- King Charles III arrives in Ottawa this week to underscore Canada's sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cHis Majesty King Charles III will read the speech from the throne and thus present the plan of our government, our priorities, as Canada is facing a pivotal moment in its history, the biggest transformation of the global trading system since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Carney told his caucus Sunday.",
      "Carney said \u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in the sovereign\" when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe are different and the king illustrates that,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cIf you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne than you have to then acknowledge Canada\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there\u2019s a message to be sent there\u2019s easier ways to do that like calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Trump to notice the visit because the president has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family.",
      "Harris said Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\u201d",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state. The king will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCharles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Trump on behalf of the king during a time when Trump threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTo be frank,\u201d Carney told Britain's Sky News. \u201cThey weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance. It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",
      "The king has more recently been showing support for Canada, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a British aircraft carrier.",
      "After he arrives on Monday he will drop the ceremonial first puck or ball during a street hockey game. He will also attend a community event and meet with Carney and Canada's governor general, his representative as head of state. The king will return to the U.K. after Tuesday's speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival. At the opening ceremony, honorary Palme d'Or recipient Robert De Niro called Trump \u201cAmerica's philistine president.\u201d",
      "Other top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning,\" and Ari Aster's \u201cEddington,\u201d which found a divisive reaction.",
      "Panahi's win put him in rare company. He's now won Cannes' Palme d'Or, Venice's Golden Lion (for \u201cThe Circle\u201d) and Berlin's Golden Bear (for \u201cTaxi\u201d). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.",
      "Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, \u201ceven in complicated situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cYou have this power.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, died at 81 from leukemia, his family said Friday. Local media reported he died in Paris, where he lived for more than 55 years.",
      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che, a major French composer who worked with Salgado for his exhibition \u201cAqua Mater\u201d in Paris, said the Brazilian was an \u201cauthentic and warm man\u201d.",
      "\u201cHis gaze transformed landscapes, and beyond the spectacular, he reached a kind of inner truth (\u2026). With him, photography fulfilled one of its highest ambitions by going far beyond mere appearances,\u201d M\u00e2che told The Associated Press.",
      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",
      "An exhibition of about 400 of Salgado\u2019s works is currently on display in the city of Deauville, in northern France.",
      "Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, which published several of Salgado\u2019s works over the last decades, said he recently canceled a meeting with journalists in the French city of Reims due to health problems. He was scheduled to attend an exhibition with works by his son Rodrigo for a church in the same city on Saturday, the daily reported.",
      "Salgado and his wife had been working since the 1990s to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais. In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",
      "So far, Instituto Terra has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimores, which lies in what was once a somewhat deserted region in the countryside of the Minas Gerais state. The photographer was born there in 1944.",
      "In an undated interview with Forbes Brasil published on Thursday, Salgado said that attending the exhibition of his works in Deuville felt like a stroll through his life.",
      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\u201cIf a photographer is not there, there's no image. We need to be there. We expose ourselves a lot. And that is why it is such an immense privilege.\u201d",

      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",
      "The program is the brainchild of Panthers hockey operations president and general manager Bill Zito and his wife Julie Zito.",
      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",
      "The program formally launched in March and has been backed by famed artist Romero Britto along with NFL players \u2014 and South Florida natives \u2014 Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa, among others.",
      "Julie Zito is a cancer survivor, Bill Zito lost his mother and sister to cancer, and the Zito family recently lost a close friend to cancer as well.

      "The team is hoping to raise at least $1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in all of our families and all of our friendships,\" said Zito, who joined the Panthers in 2020. \"It makes me more determined not to achieve a goal for the goal\u2019s sake, but to achieve a goal to bring people together.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.",
      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "A leading medical group is warning of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country",
      "CAIRO -- A leading medical group warned on Tuesday of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country, and said its teams have treated hundreds of patients in the region of the capital, Khartoum.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "France\u2019s lower house of parliament has adopted a bill to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",
      "Activists have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",
      "French religious leaders this month issued a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the dangers of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",

      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",

      "Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court",
      "LONDON -- Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court.",
      "Winning titles is fun, too.",
      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.",
      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",
      "Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.",
      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",
      "Invented in Japan by Takei Miyoshi in 1984, blind tennis is played around the world. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said.",
      "Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 \u2014 as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. He is also the two-time defending champion of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament.",
      "The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be \u201cwidely and regularly practiced\u201d in at least 32 countries and three continents.",
      "\u201cI really want it to be in the Paralympics,\u201d Rizvi said, \"but I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments, just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I\u2019d love for blind tennis to be there as well because it\u2019s definitely got the potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got the countries, the continents, the people, the passion behind it.\"",

      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",

It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago. He was arrested on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command.",
      "One of its officers told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included as Chambers as a participant.",
      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, was not written by him.",

Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, elected last year in a landslide, has 403 seats, and the center-right Conservatives 121.",

      "Reform got about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election, but it has surged to the top of many opinion polls. Reform made big gains in local elections this month, winning several mayoralties and control of 10 local councils.",

      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV visited the papal summer palace south of Rome on Thursday as questions swirled whether he will use it himself to escape the heat or follow in Pope Francis\u2019 footsteps and keep the hilltop estate as a museum and environmental center.",
      "Leo paid a visit to the Borgo Laudato Si, an educational sustainability project that grew out of Francis\u2019 2015 environmental encyclical \u201cPraised Be,\u201d the Vatican said. The center is located in the gardens of the Vatican\u2019s Castel Gandolfo property on Lake Alban in the hills south of Rome.",
      "Pope Urban VIII built the palace on the northern end of town in 1624, to give popes an escape from the sweltering Roman summers. It was enlarged over succeeding pontificates to its present size of 55 hectares (136 acres), which is actually bigger than Vatican City itself.",
      "Popes past used it regularly in summer, and Pope Benedict XVI famously closed out his papacy there on Feb. 28, 2013. But Francis, a homebody who never took a proper vacation during his 12-year pontificate, decided to remain in Rome in summer.",
      "In 2014 he decided to open Castel Gandolfo\u2019s gardens to the public, and later turned part of the palazzo itself into a museum, in part to help offset the economic downturn the town experienced with no popes holding weekly Sunday prayers there in summer.",
      "Leo, a former missionary priest who spent the bulk of his priesthood in Peru, hasn\u2019t said where he will live full-time in Rome, much less whether he will use the palace as a summer getaway.",

      "The executive secretary to Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. says Marcos will retain Defense Secretary Gilberto during a midterm overhaul of his Cabinet",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will retain Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., who is among the most vocal critics of China in Asia, as Marcos presses on with a midterm overhaul of his Cabinet, a senior official said Thursday.",
      "Teodoro, who has strongly echoed Marcos\u2019 criticisms of China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea, will remain in his post, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin told a news conference.",
      "Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III will be the next chief of the 232,000-member national police. Torre led the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte in March and his turnover to International Criminal Court detention in The Netherlands for his deadly anti-drug crackdowns, Bersamin said.",
      "Last year, Torre oversaw the arrest of Philippine religious leader Apollo Quiboloy, a key Duterte supporter who was placed on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list after being indicted for sexual abuses and trafficking in the U.S. Torre would take over his retiring predecessor, Gen. Rommel Marbil.",
      "Marcos asked all of his Cabinet secretaries last week to submit resignations in what the government said was a \u201cbold reset\u201d of his administration following the May 12 midterm elections, which saw more opposition candidates win crucial Senate seats.",
      "Marcos, the 67-year-old son of a late Philippine dictator overthrown in 1986, won the presidency in the deeply divided Southeast Asian country by a landslide in 2022 in a stunning political comeback as he made a steadfast call for national unity. But his equally popular vice-presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, later had a falling out with him that has sparked intense political discord.",
      "With support from friendly countries including the U.S., a treaty ally, Marcos emerged as the most vocal critic of China\u2019s actions in the disputed South China Sea while contending with an array of longstanding domestic issues including inflation, delayed fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring down the price of rice and many reports of kidnappings and other crimes.",
      "Teodoro told The Associated Press in March that China\u2019s aggressive policies in the disputed waters were now considered the greatest threat to the Philippines' national security and should also be regarded as a global threat because it could choke a trade route that is crucial for global supply chains.",
      "\"The greatest external threat actually is Chinese aggression, Chinese expansionism and the attempt by China to change the international law through the use of force or acquiescence \u2026 or its attempt to reshape the world order to one that it controls,\u201d Teodoro told the AP.",
      "Bersamin, who serves as executive secretary to Marcos and the Cabinet, has not specified the reasons for each Cabinet change but said \u201cthe president has no patience for under performance.\"",
      "Bersamin said last week that Marcos decided to replace Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo with Foreign Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro, who has relayed Philippine protests and led talks with Chinese officials concerning an alarming spike of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in recent years.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a key global trade and security route despite a 2016 international arbitration ruling initiated by the Philippines that invalidated those expansive claims based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also are involved in the long-seething territorial standoffs regarded as a flashpoint in Asia.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland\u2019s presidential election has come down to a stark ideological choice: a liberal pro-European mayor versus a staunch nationalist conservative. They are polling so close that the outcome is impossible to predict in the run-off round on Sunday.",
      "It's not just a domestic affair. President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind the nationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, and dangled the prospect of closer military ties if Poles choose him over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski.",
      "Trump met with Nawrocki earlier this month at the White House and sent his Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to a meeting of the conservative pressure group CPAC in Poland, where she offered a strong endorsement.",
      "Noem even dangled the prospect of closer U.S.-Polish military ties in the event of a Nawrocki win \u2014 with the implied warning that a Trzaskowski victory could jeopardize Poland\u2019s security.",
      "At stake is not only Poland\u2019s domestic course but also the international standing of a key European Union and NATO member on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, in a region gripped by anxiety over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Sunday\u2019s vote will either empower Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a pro-EU reformer, with a presidential ally who can advance his rule-of-law agenda \u2014 or saddle him with a rival who could veto legislation and block government initiatives.",
      "Trzaskowski\u2019s supporters argue that a pro-European leader would enhance Poland\u2019s global standing during a time of war in Europe. Nawrocki\u2019s backers believe only conservative rule can safeguard national sovereignty and traditional Christian values, and they say Trump\u2019s support would greatly enhance Poland\u2019s security.",
      "But the candidate who may ultimately decide the outcome is one who won\u2019t appear on the runoff ballot.",
      "S\u0142awomir Mentzen, a 38-year-old far-right politician and beer producer from the central city of Torun, finished third in the first round of voting on May 18, with nearly 15% of the vote. Though eliminated, his supporters \u2014 often young, anti-establishment, and deeply skeptical of both Brussels and Poland's political establishment \u2014 have become the most sought-after constituency in the country.",
      "Both remaining candidates have gone out of their way to court Mentzen and his base. In recent days, each man traveled to the north-central Polish town of Torun, famous for being the birthplace of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, to appear on Mentzen's YouTube channel, where he has built a following with a mix of libertarian economics, nationalist rhetoric, and anti-EU invective.",
      "His influence highlights a broader shift in Polish politics, where the far right \u2014 once considered a fringe force \u2014 is increasingly shaping the national agenda. It\u2019s also part of a larger trend of hard-right parties gaining traction across Europe.",
      "Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Warsaw office, says Poland is part of a larger pattern in which voters turn to populist forces amid rapid social change. But he also cites local factors, such as disillusionment with Tusk\u2019s coalition.",
      "That coalition, which spans the ideological spectrum, has struggled to agree on key issues, including liberalizing the abortion law \u2014 a campaign promise. Meanwhile, outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda has blocked parts of Tusk\u2019s agenda. Observers say the coalition\u2019s voters must be highly mobilized on Sunday to defeat Nawrocki.",
      "Many votes in the first round went to protest candidates. Among voters aged 18\u201329, over 35% backed Mentzen, and nearly 20% supported a far-left candidate, Adrian Zandberg, according to exit polls.",
      "In addition, an extreme right-wing antisemite, Grzegorz Braun, won more than 6% of the votes overall.",
      "Buras believes right-wing protest candidates are more appealing today than those on the left because they promise to restore a lost past, while the left promises a better future that many see as unattainable.",
      "\u201cThe world is changing, society is changing very fast, much faster than anytime in the past,\" Buras said. \u201cPeople are worried and they vote for those who say we can go back to the glorious past.\u201d",
      "Since the first round, Mentzen \u2014 co-leader of the Confederation party \u2014 has presented both candidates with an eight-point list of demands: no new taxes; defense of cash payments; expanded gun rights; and opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine, among others.",
      "Nawrocki, who appeared on Mentzen\u2019s show on June 22, signed on to all eight points \u2014 including the controversial Ukraine stance \u2014 breaking with his Law and Justice party\u2019s longstanding support for Kyiv\u2019s integration with the West.",
      "Trzaskowski appeared two days later. He said he could agree with some points, like fiscal restraint, but rejected others. He strongly defended LGBTQ+ rights and reaffirmed that Ukraine should eventually join NATO, once the war ends, calling it key to Poland's own security.",
      "The YouTube interviews have dominated the political conversation, underscoring how Mentzen, a TikTok-savvy outsider, has upended traditional campaigning.",
      "The exchange between Trzaskowski and Mentzen on Saturday was occasionally tense, especially over LGBTQ+ rights, but remained civil and substantive.",
      "In many ways it overshadowed a traditional televised debate the day before. The substance of that debate did not seem to change the trajectory of the campaign. The thing Poles discussed most was a brief moment when Nawrocki inserted something into his mouth which he later said was a tobacco pouch. Some have questioned if he is fit to be president if he couldn't get through a two-hour debate without taking a hit of tobacco.",
      "After the sometimes sharp exchanges, Mentzen sat down for a beer with Trzaskowski and others in the pub he owns.",
      "The informal gathering was documented by Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who was there as well. He posted a video on social media Saturday evening showing the group with the words: \u201cFor a Poland that unites, not divides.\u201d",
      "The video quickly went viral, with commentators speculating about whether it was a spontaneous gesture or a calculated political move.",
      "It was also one more example, if more were needed, of how far-right forces in Europe are slowly becoming accepted.",
      "For Mentzen, the moment was also awkward. The man who made his name skewering the political elite appeared cozy with establishment figures. Critics on the hard right lashed out, revealing fractures in the movement he helped popularize.",
      "After dangling the promises of an endorsement for days, Mentzen on Wednesday afternoon said he wouldn\u2019t offer one to either candidate. \u201cVote as your conscience tells you,\u201d he told his supporters.",

      "The P-3C patrol plane took off from its base in the southeastern city of Pohang at 1:43 p.m. but fell to the ground due to unknown reasons, the navy said in a statement.",
      "The navy is working to determine the status of the four people aboard the plane and why it crashed, the statement said. There have been no reports of civilian casualties on the ground, it said.",
      "Pohang\u2019s Nambu police station also confirmed the crash involved a navy patrol aircraft and it couldn\u2019t immediately confirm whether there were any deaths or injuries.",
      "An emergency office in Pohang said that rescue workers and fire trucks were dispatched to the site after receiving reports from local residents that an unidentified aircraft fell onto a hill near an apartment complex and caused a fire.",
      "The scale and damage of the fire wasn't immediately known. Yonhap news agency published photos showing firefighters and at least one water truck operating near the crash site, with flames flickering as black-gray smoke engulfed the trees.",
      "In December, a Jeju Air passenger plane crashed at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. It was one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea\u2019s aviation history.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court on Thursday discharged the husband of an Australian diplomat without convicting him, months after the man pleaded guilty to assault for drunkenly spitting on a teenager during a street altercation on the night of a rugby match in Wellington.",
      "The man was granted permanent name suppression. Judge Paul Mabey, presiding at the Wellington District Court, said he didn\u2019t accept the man\u2019s arguments that the potential harms to him justified the discharge, but the magistrate agreed that his wife\u2019s diplomatic career could be curbed by an assault conviction and the publication of his name.",
      "The man could be barred from travel abroad to her future postings, the judge said, and the family could be split up if the Australian High Commission decided he could not remain in New Zealand to preserve bilateral relations between the countries.",
      "The charges arose after an episode last September after the man attended a rugby match between New Zealand and Australia in the capital, which Australia lost 33-13. He was drunk when he arrived at Wellington\u2019s main nightlife area, where he approached a group of teenagers and became aggressive when they didn\u2019t want to engage with him, the judge said.",
      "A member of the group punched the man, who responded by spitting on a young woman. He was arrested by police officers who happened to be passing.",
      "The case has provoked widespread news coverage in New Zealand and Australia, which featured cell phone footage of the man\u2019s arrest. In the video, he was seen verbally abusing a police officer and claiming to have diplomatic immunity. He had such immunity, conferred by protocol to the partners of senior envoys to New Zealand, which he later waived voluntarily.",
      "He pleaded guilty to New Zealand's lowest level of assault charge in January. It is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to 4,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,400).",
      "\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt at all, he is not here to be sentenced for abusing the police or rashly claiming diplomatic immunity,\u201d Judge Mabey said.",
      "\u201cHe was right to say he had that immunity,\" the judge added. \"He was completely stupid to say it at all.\u201d",
      "But the magistrate said he would discharge the man because of his wife\u2019s suggestion that the Australian diplomatic service would be unable to ignore the husband\u2019s conviction and the widely-distributed cell phone video of his arrest when considering her future.",
      "\u201cIf I were not to suppress his name, his offending would be inextricably linked to his wife and she would suffer considerably,\u201d the judge said.",
      "He rejected a bid by the man\u2019s lawyer to suppress the country his wife represented in New Zealand.",

      "Ex-Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. was arrested in East Timor\u2019s capital of Dili on Wednesday by immigration authorities and would immediately be deported to the Philippines for staying without a visa and after his passport was cancelled by Manila\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs, the East Timor government said in a statement.",
      "East Timor did not immediately specify a date for the deportation of Teves, who has been staying in Dili for more than two years as he tried to seek asylum, straining relations between the two Southeast Asian democracies. The Philippines has been calling on East Timor to repatriate Teves to face trial.",
      "The Department of Justice in Manila on Thursday welcomed East Timor\u2019s decision and said it has designated a team of justice and immigration officials to help repatriate Teves.",
      "East Timor said in a statement that Teves\u2019 presence in the country was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and his stay for more than two years \u201cposes a disruptive factor in bilateral relations between the two states and establishes a serious precedent with potential implications for internal security.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe perception that Timor-Leste might be viewed as a refuge for individuals fleeing international justice undermines the integrity of our borders and our shared efforts to combat transnational crime,\u201d East Timor said, using the country\u2019s formal name.",
      "\u201cThe imminent full accession of Timor-Leste to ASEAN, scheduled for October this year, further reinforces the responsibility of the Timorese state to actively collaborate with its regional partners in upholding justice, legality, and stability in the region,\u201d according to East Timor.",
      "East Timor President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta told The Associated Press in an interview in Dili in September that there was \u201cno possibility, under the law\u201d that Teves would be able to remain in East Timor and that he would likely be sent back to the Philippines after his appeal to gain asylum had been exhausted.",
      "Teves has been sought by the Philippine government in connection with the March 2023 killings of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and several other people, including impoverished villagers seeking medical aid from him, by men in military camouflage and body armor who barged into his central Philippine home with assault rifles. At least 17 others were wounded in the brazen attack, which was captured on security cameras.",
      "Teves has denied involvement in the killings, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who was backed by Degamo, then called \u201cpurely political.\u201d",
      "East Timor, Asia\u2019s youngest country, is in the process of joining the Philippines and nine other countries in the ASEAN, a regional grouping which espouses the rule of law and good governance. It currently has observer status in the regional bloc.",
      "Teves\u2019 initial request to seek asylum in East Timor was rejected, a decision which he appealed. In March 2024, police arrested Teves while he was playing at a golf driving range in Dili and it\u2019s not immediately clear how he managed to regain liberty before bring put into custody by immigration authorities on Wednesday.",

      "The local authorities have dusted off Cold War-era bomb shelters, installed a new satellite communications system and are working with the military on plans to help a deployment of Western forces in case of conflict.",
      "\u201cThe lesson we learned from Ukraine is that everybody pitched in,\u201d said Odd John Resser, Kongsberg\u2019s Emergency Planning Officer, noting breweries that pivoted to making Molotov cocktails, local authorities that built schools in shelters and weapons factories which ramped up production.",
      "Across the Nordic nations, governments are boosting defense spending, reassessing security and pushing the concept of total defense. It\u2019s an approach which mobilizes the whole of society to defend against military and non-military threats.",

      "\u201cAfter decades of peace,\u201d it warned, \u201ca new era has begun for Norway and for Europe.\"",
      "\u201cWhat is now happening in Ukraine has to be a wake-up call for all and we must strengthen our defense to prevent anything like that from happening to us,\u201d Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told The Associated Press.",
      "Norway announced in January that it plans to start building bomb shelters in new buildings after halting the practice in 1998.",
      "The Swedish government appointed its first minister for civil defense in 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Residents aged 16 to 70 are required to serve in the event or threat of war, either in the military or helping to provide rescue, firefighting, healthcare or other services.",
      "Finland's civil defense shelters are the envy of the Nordics and can fit around 86% of the Finnish population. One public shelter in Helsinki can fit 6,000 people, is designed to withstand the fallout from a nuclear attack and is in an almost constant state of readiness with beds and sinks tucked away behind blast doors and an underground hockey pitch.",

      "\u201cHow would you and your nearest family manage if the electricity supply was cut off for a longer period? What would you do if the water supply failed?\u201d the Norwegian handbook asks.",
      "AP spoke to 11 people in Kongsberg and the majority said they had some form of supplies. While most didn\u2019t have a stockpile for seven days \u2013 and some had nothing at all \u2013 two people said they could probably survive for more than a week.",
      "\u201cRussia is very close to Norway and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I would rather be prepared than not prepared,\u201d said Katina Bakke, who works in a sports shop in Kongsberg.",
      "Although Norwegian authorities are not expecting an imminent conflict, if war comes to Northern Europe, Kongsberg could be critical.",
      "The municipality, 85 kilometers (52 miles) southwest of the Norwegian capital Oslo with a population of around 27,000 people, is the headquarters of the Kongsberg Group, which makes high-precision weapons currently used in Ukraine. The company opened a new factory in 2024, ramping up production of advanced missiles used by multiple European countries.",
      "The town could also play host to troops if there is a conflict. In May, local authorities across the region met with the military to plan support for Western troops with logistics and healthcare in the event of a deployment.",
      "\u201cIf the allies are coming to Norway, either staying, training, doing war work or in transit towards the east, we will have a big task for the whole community to support that,\u201d Resser said.",
      "By readying for the worst, Resser said, the municipality also prepares for other \u2014 more likely \u2014 threats such as a pandemic, extreme weather or power outages such as the one that immobilized Spain and Portugal in April.",
      "Authorities in Kongsberg were not always so proactive but a flood in 2007 and an exercise simulating a four-day power disruption in 2016 made them realize they needed to step up.",
      "They did a risk assessment, as obliged by law, identified more than 30 vulnerabilities and started spending money on contingency plans.",
      "Back-up power generators were bought for the town hall, medical facilities and old people\u2019s homes as well as a satellite link to be able to call for help. In case of a cyberattack, the local health authorities print and file critical patient data once a week.",

      "The second system was discovered to be broken in November last year, shortly after Donald Trump was elected for a second term as U.S. president.",
      "Unsure of what Trump's election would mean for Norway, the local authorities chose a Norwegian satellite communications provider over an American competitor, Resser said, because the municipality wanted to make sure it had \u201cnational control\u201d in an emergency.",
      "The \u201ckey difference\u201d in the resilience model used across the Nordic nations is that it \u201cempowers\u201d local authorities to make decisions said Martha Turnbull, Director at the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki, Finland.",
      "In the Nordics it\u2019s not up to the army to bring in bottles of water in a crisis; rather, there is the \u201cexpectation\u201d that local authorities will respond, along with civilians and businesses, Turnbull said.",
      "Europeans elsewhere need to realize the threat from Moscow can reach \u201cmuch deeper\u201d than nations bordering Russia, said Matthew Redhead, a national security expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",

      "Reeling off suspicious incidents at the company, he detailed how in 2024 an activist tried to destroy engines for fighter jets, drones were spotted over an area where it's illegal to fly and attempts were made to get through a factory perimeter.",
      "It's not always possible to identify motivation or to say if the incidents are separate, linked or just \u201csome kid\u201d flying a drone, but the number of suspicious events indicates sabotage is highly possible, Tvedt said.",
      "Moscow is ramping up its activities in Europe to a \u201cpre-war\u201d level, said Redhead, but away from Russia ordinary people and local authorities may be less ready for a crisis because \u201cwe don\u2019t think we will be on the front line.\u201d",
      "\u201cFreaking people out about this at some point is potentially quite necessary.\u201d",

      "Mexicans will vote in the country\u2019s first judicial elections Sunday",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexicans will vote in the country\u2019s first judicial elections Sunday. The fiercely debated question is whether electing judges will deepen democratic decay or purge courts of rampant corruption and impunity.",
      "The vote comes as power in Mexico has been increasingly concentrated in the popular president\u2019s office, and as organized crime wields significant political influence in many parts of the country. Critics worry that electing judges will weaken checks and balances on government and stack the courts in favor of the ruling party.",
      "Judges and court staff previously earned their positions through merit and experience. Now the election has more than 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions, including on Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court. Hundreds more positions will be elected in 2027.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something like this before. What Mexico is doing is like an experiment, and we don\u2019t know what the outcome of it will be,\u201d said Carin Zissis, director of the Council of the Americas' Washington office.",
      "Mexico\u2019s judicial elections will pick judges across every level of government, an unprecedented situation globally.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador led the push for the overhaul. The highly popular leader was long at odds with Mexican courts, which regularly struck down reform proposals and halted projects they called an overreach of executive power. L\u00f3pez Obrador went as far as publicly criticizing judges in his press briefings.",
      "Last September, after dominating presidential and legislative elections, his Morena party jammed the constitutional reform through congress. His ally and successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has continued to champion it.",
      "The overhaul notably put limits on the Supreme Court's power to widely block presidential actions and laws, and set up a disciplinary tribunal for judges.",
      "\u201cThe way I see it, the Supreme Court is going to once again become irrelevant, just like it was in the old days of authoritarian rule ... when its ability to monitor constitutionality was basically null,\u201d said Rafael Estada, a constitutional historian.",
      "Sheinbaum and L\u00f3pez Obrador have asserted that by popularly electing judges, they can root out corruption in the judiciary and bring the branch closer to the people.",
      "\u201cWho is going to choose the judges on the court now? The Mexican people. That\u2019s the big difference between what once was and what now is,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday as she called on Mexicans to vote.",
      "\u201cAnd that,\u201d she added, \u201cis democracy.\u201d",
      "Many on the ballot won a lottery after being screened by committees made up of people from the three branches of government \u2014 two of which are controlled by the president\u2019s party. To qualify, candidates need a law degree, five years of professional experience, an essay and letters of recommendation from friends and colleagues.",
      "The passage of the reform legislation sparked weeks of protests by judges and judicial staff, a sharp rebuke from the Biden administration and concerns by international investors, causing the Mexican peso to dip.",
      "Opponents have called on Mexicans to boycott the vote, and the election is projected to have low turnout.",
      "The opponents \u2013 former judges, legal experts, politicians and foreign observers -\u2014 say that battling corruption and impunity in the courts is not a bad idea. Most Mexicans agree that the judiciary is rife with corruption.",
      "\u201cThe judiciary has a lot of scores to settle in this country,\u201d said Georgina De la Fuente, election specialist with the Mexican consulting firm Strategia Electoral.",
      "But critics say the ruling party is simply politicizing the courts at an opportune moment, when Sheinbaum is highly popular.",
      "Judicial candidates are not allowed to announce their party affiliation and are unable to accept party funds or hold major campaign events. A number of former Morena government officials and allies, however, have posted lists on social media of which ones to elect.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority said Wednesday it also had investigated cases of physical guides handed out to potential voters in Mexico City and Nuevo Leon state, something it said could amount to \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way in which this reform was designed does not give people greater access to justice. It was designed to take control of the judiciary and blur the division of powers,\u201d De la Fuente said.",
      "Others warn that the overhaul could open the judiciary to questionable judges and allow organized crime to further influence Mexico\u2019s justice system.",
      "A number of candidates have raised eyebrows. Chief among them is Silvia Delgado Garc\u00eda, a former lawyer for drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is running to be a criminal court judge in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Critics \u201cspeak out of ignorance because whether or not I\u2019ve represented some person doesn\u2019t transform you into that person,\u201d she told the AP as she handed out campaign flyers to people crossing the border from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas.",
      "\u201cWhat I can promise you is I\u2019ll be an impartial judge,\u201d she told some voters.",
      "Watchdogs also say that last year's vote on the reform was rushed through, criteria for candidates wasn\u2019t always followed, the number of candidates was limited by a lottery and lower-court orders trying to keep the reforms from taking effect were ignored.",
      "Zissis, of Council of the Americas, said the reforms could increase instability in the region at a time of rapid political change.",
      "Mexico\u2019s government has been working furiously to talk U.S. President Donald Trump down from tariff threats and meet demands by his administration to crack down on organized crime. At the same time, Trump has been locked in political fights with courts trying to block various actions.",
      "The turmoil could hurt international investment in Mexico if investors believe their money is less secure, Zissis said.",

      "Following a monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.5%. It was its fourth cut since October, when it began lowering borrowing costs for the first time in years to support a weakening economy. The bank slashed its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, nearly halving its previous projection of 1.5% announced in February.",

      "South Korea\u2019s domestic economic activity remained sluggish in April following a contraction in the first quarter driven by weak consumption and business investment, the bank said. It said job creation in manufacturing and other sectors was slow.",
      "Since beginning his second term, Trump has vowed to slap huge new tariffs on foreign products entering the United States, including those from Mexico, Canada and China, which he insists will create more domestic jobs and shrink the federal deficit.",
      "In recent weeks, South Korea has sent trade officials to Washington to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and potential product-specific duties on semiconductors and cars, which are major exports for the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "A decision by a U.S. federal court saying Trump lacks the legal authority to impose such tariffs could upset his plans, but the White House has appealed and it's unclear what will happen in the longer run.",
      "Experts say South Korea's leverage in trade talks and its ability to tackle domestic economic challenges have been undermined by political instability after former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ill-fated imposition of martial law in December. Yoon was formally ousted from office in April, setting the stage for a snap presidential election next week.",

      "After months of political turmoil, South Koreans will head to the polls Tuesday to elect a president to succeed disgraced former leader Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted from office over his ill-fated decision to impose martial law in December",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After months of political turmoil, South Koreans head to the polls next week to elect a president to succeed disgraced former leader Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted from office over his ill-fated decision to impose martial law in December.",
      "Here is a timeline of events that led to Tuesday\u2019s tense snap election:",
      "According to their criminal indictments, Yoon meets with his defense minister to discuss gridlock in the National Assembly as liberal opposition lawmakers use their majority to impeach senior officials and prosecutors and cut government budgets. Prosecutors say Yoon told the minister he wanted to take \u201cemergency measures\u201d against the opposition, something they allege he had been saying for months.",
      "In a televised announcement at 10:29 p.m., Yoon tells the nation he\u2019s declaring martial law, portraying the National Assembly as a \u201cden of criminals\u201d paralyzing government affairs. As lawmakers begin rushing to the National Assembly, the military\u2019s martial law command issues a proclamation declaring sweeping government powers, including the suspension of political parties\u2019 activities and control over media. It says anyone who violates the decree can be arrested without a warrant. Hundreds of heavily armed troops encircle the legislature, apparently to prevent lawmakers from gathering to vote on the martial law declaration.",
      "At around 1 a.m., 190 lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon\u2019s own conservative People Power Party, vote unanimously to lift martial law. Troops and police begin to retreat from the National Assembly shortly after. At 4:30 a.m., martial law is formally lifted following a Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yoon apologizes and says he won\u2019t shirk legal or political responsibility for declaring martial law. He survives an impeachment vote boycotted by most ruling party lawmakers.",
      "Yoon defends his martial law decree as an act of governance and denies rebellion charges, vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the face of attempts to impeach him.",
      "The National Assembly impeaches Yoon on a 204-85 vote. His presidential powers and duties are suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s No. 2 official, takes over.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court issues a warrant to detain Yoon for questioning.",
      "Anti-corruption investigators and police raid the presidential compound and detain Yoon, who is the first sitting president to be detained.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court grants law enforcement authorities' request for a formal arrest warrant for Yoon, citing concerns he could destroy evidence. His arrest triggers a riot by his supporters, who break into the court, smashing windows and equipment. Dozens are arrested.",
      "The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office indicts Yoon on charges of masterminding an attempted rebellion, describing his power grab as an illegal bid to seize the legislature and election offices and arrest political opponents.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court orders Yoon released from detention, citing unresolved issues about whether investigators had the proper authority to detain him. He is released the following day.",
      "The Constitutional Court upholds Yoon\u2019s impeachment and removes him as president, forcing a snap election within 60 days to choose his successor. The government the following week announces June 3 as election day.",
      "The government announces the presidential election will be held on June 3.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party nominates former party chief Lee Jae-myung as its presidential candidate. Opinion polls project him as the clear frontrunner in the weeks leading up to the election.",
      "The conservative People Power Party nominates Yoon\u2019s former labor minister, Kim Moon Soo, as its presidential candidate.",
      "The People Power Party cancels then reinstates Kim\u2019s presidential candidacy within hours, after a failed attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han, in a chaotic U-turn that underscores its disarray.",
      "Lee, Kim, and two other minor candidates participate in the first presidential debate, which focuses on restoring political stability following the martial law saga and addressing trade challenges posed by the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The two-day, early voting begins in about 3,570 polling stations ahead of the formal June 3 vote.",

      "LISBON, Portugal -- Portugal\u2019s anti-immigration Chega party notched another political gain for Europe's far right on Wednesday after it was assigned the second-most seats in parliament \u2014 meaning it will become the head of the parliamentary opposition to the new government.",
      "That shatters the pattern of Portugal\u2019s center-right and center-left mainstream parties alternating between heading a government or leading the opposition.",
      "Chega\u2019s strides since the May 18 election coincide with gains elsewhere by far-right forces. In Europe, those include France\u2019s National Rally, the Brothers of Italy and Alternative for Germany, which are now in the political mainstream.",
      "Leading the opposition is quite the accomplishment for a once-fringe party that competed in its first election six years ago, when it won one seat. It has surged recently with its hardline stance against immigration and with the inability of traditional parties to form lasting governments. The May 18th election was Portugal's third in as many years.",
      "Chega, which means \u201cEnough,\u201d secured 60 of the National Assembly's 230 seats after it picked up two more seats on Wednesday from the overseas voters of the European Union country of 10.6 million people.",

      "The center-right Democratic Alliance, led by the Social Democratic Party, captured two more seats to take its tally to 88.",
      "Following the election, incoming Prime Minister Luis Montenegro was already looking at heading another minority government similar to the one that fell two months ago in a confidence vote after less than a year in power.",
      "But now Montenegro and other parties will face an emboldened far-right competitor that campaigned under the slogan \u201cSave Portugal\u201d and describes itself as a nationalist party.",

      "Truck drivers in Iran continued a nearly week-long strike on Wednesday, incensed by low salaries, high insurance rates, and a possible hike in fuel prices",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Truck drivers in Iran blocked roads and ports Wednesday as part of their strike action protesting low salaries, high insurance rates, and a possible hike in fuel prices.",
      "The strikes, which began last Thursday in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, one of the country\u2019s main transportation and shipping hubs, have now spread across Iran. The protests are slowly gaining steam, supported by prominent dissident voices, and could morph into more serious protests against the government.",
      "Last week, the Iranian government announced plans to increase the price of fuel for trucks from 4 cents per liter (15.14 cents per gallon) to nearly 50 cents per liter (about $1.90 per gallon) in late June. With massive resources of oil and gas, Iran has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world. The average price for a gallon of gas in the United States on Wednesday was $3.16, according to AAA, a drivers' assistance and advisory service.",
      "Dissident Iranians expressed their support for the truckers. Film director Jafar Panahi, who last week won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival, encouraged the truck drivers to start a nationwide strike.",
      "\u201cThe strike is a loud cry to the government: enough is enough! Stop the massive suppression and plundering before everything is lost and nothing remains for people,\u201d he wrote on Instagram.",
      "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was imprisoned on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran\u2019s government, also expressed her support for the strike on X.",
      "Videos circulating on social media showed lines of trucks parked on the sides of major roads. Iran said the plan is intended to prevent fuel smuggling into neighboring countries. Fuel in neighboring Pakistan costs more than a dollar per liter ($4 per gallon).",
      "Many of Iran's previous rounds of anti-government protests started out as economic protests over local issues, including demonstrations in 2017 and 2018. Those protests were met with a heavy reaction by the police and the Basij, the all-volunteer force of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",
      "In 2019, anger over the government eliminating the gasoline subsidy also sparked nation-wide protests. More than 1,000 people were arrested and the country temporarily shut down the internet. Protests also rocked the country in 2022 over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in Iranian security custody after morality police detained her for improperly wearing her headscarf, or hijab.",
      "On Saturday, Jalal Mousavi, an official in the truckers\u2019 union, said truckers are striking because they are struggling with the rising costs of fuel, spare parts and repairs.",
      "The strike underscores the mounting economic pressures on Iran as it struggles to secure relief from crippling sanctions in the ongoing negotiations with the United States. Iran\u2019s oil sector, the lifeblood of its economy, has been damaged by the impact of American sanctions over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, and it is one of the central issues under discussion in the Iran-U.S. negotiations.",
      "On Wednesday, Fatemeh Mohajerani, the spokesperson of the government\u2019s Cabinet, said lawmakers had discussed the strike in the Cabinet meeting and the administration will consider the truckers' needs. State TV showed footage of routine activities in truck terminals and ports.",

      "Cambodian restaurants are not in every U.S. city the way Chinese and Japanese ones are",
      "Chef Phila Lorn was not necessarily aiming for \u201cquote-unquote authentic\u201d Cambodian food when he opened Mawn in his native Philadelphia two years ago. So when he approached some Cambodian teen patrons, he braced himself for questioning.",
      "\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to say something like, \u2018That\u2019s not how my mom makes her oxtail soup,'\u201d Lorn said. \"So I walk up to the table. I\u2019m like, \u2018How is everything?\u2019 And the kid looks up to me and he goes, \u2018It doesn\u2019t even matter, dude. So glad you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was at that moment that Lorn realized Mawn \u2014 the phonetic spelling of the Khmer word for \u201cchicken\u201d \u2014 was more than a noodle shop. It meant representation.",
      "In June, he will be representing his dual cultures \u2014 Cambodian and Philly \u2014 at his first James Beard Awards, as a nominee for Best Emerging Chef. In the food world, it's akin to getting nominated for the Academy Awards.",
      "Cambodian restaurants may not be as commonplace in the U.S. as Chinese takeout or sushi spots. And Cambodian food is often lazily lumped in with the food of its Southeast Asian neighbors, despite its own distinctness. But in recent years, enterprising Cambodian American chefs have come into their own, introducing traditional dishes or putting their own twist on them.",
      "Many of them were raised in families who fled the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror, which began 50 years ago and killed about 1.7 million people. Since then, the Cambodian community in the U.S. has grown and set down roots.",
      "Through food, these chefs are putting the attention back on Cambodian heritage and culture, rather than that traumatic history.",
      "Dr. Leakhena Nou, a sociology professor at California State University, Long Beach who has studied social anxiety among post-Khmer Rouge generations, says the Cambodian diaspora is often seen by others too narrowly through the lens of victimhood. In 2022, she publicly opposed California legislation that focused only on genocide for a K-12 curriculum on Cambodian culture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a part of their history so they shouldn\u2019t run away from it but at the same time they should force others to understand that that\u2019s not the only part of their heritage, their historical identity,\u201d she said.",
      "Cambodian food has sometimes been hastily labeled as a mild mix of Thai and Vietnamese with some Chinese and Indian influence. But, it has its own native spices and flavors that have been used throughout Southeast Asia. Khmer food emphasizes seafood and meats, vegetables, noodles, rice and fermentation. Salty and sour are prevalent tastes, Nou says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very healthy diet for the most part in terms of fresh vegetables. Cambodians love to eat fresh vegetables dipped with some sauce,\" Nou said.",
      "Signature dishes include amok, a fish curry; lok lak, stir-fried marinated beef; and samlar koko, a soup made using seasonal produce. Nou recalls her father making it with pork bone broth, fish, fresh coconut milk, lemongrass, vegetables and even wildflowers.",
      "It was a half-century ago, on April 15, 1975, that the communist Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia. For the next four years, an estimated one-quarter of the population was wiped out due to starvation, execution and illness.",
      "Refugees came in waves to the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s. Most took on low-level entry jobs with few language barriers, Nou said. These included manufacturing, meatpacking and agricultural labor. Many worked in Chinese restaurants and doughnut shops.",
      "The U.S. Cambodian population has jumped 50% in the last 20 years to an estimated 360,000 people, according to the Census 2023 American Community Survey.",
      "Lorn\u2019s family settled in Philadelphia in 1985. The only child born in the U.S., he was named after the city (but pronounced pee-LAH\u2019). Like a lot of Asian American kids, Lorn was \u201cthe smelly kid\u201d teased for not-American food in his lunch. But, he said, defending his lunchbox made him stronger. And he got the last laugh.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool now to be 38 and have that same lunchbox (food) but on plates and we\u2019re selling it for $50 a plate,\u201d said Lorn, who opened Mawn with wife Rachel after they both had worked at other restaurants.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus will offer Syrian families money to help them resettle back in their homeland and allow the main income earners to remain on the island nation for up to three years to work as part of a voluntary repatriation program, a Cypriot minister said Thursday.",
      "Deputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said that a prerequisite for families to qualify for the program is that they must drop their claims for asylum or rescind international protection status already granted to them prior to Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Unveiling the program, Ioannides said that families wishing to voluntarily return will be given a one-off sum of 2,000 euros ($2,255) for one adult and 1,000 euros ($1,128) for each child. Childless couples are also eligible to apply. The application period runs from June 2 to Aug. 31.",

      "According to the head of Cyprus\u2019 Asylum Service Andreas Georgiades, the program\u2019s premise is to help families overcome any such reluctance by affording them a modest nest egg with which to cover their immediate needs while enabling the main income earner to continue working and sending money to his family.",
      "The income earner will be allowed to travel back and forth to Syria while his or her residency and work permit are valid.",
      "Syrian nationals make up the largest group of asylum-seekers in Cyprus by far. According to Asylum Service figures, 4,226 Syrians applied for asylum last year \u2014 almost 10 times more than Afghans who are the second-largest group.",
      "\u201cThis new program is a targeted, humanitarian and realistic policy that bolsters Syria\u2019s post-war transition to normality,\u201d Ioannides said, adding that European Home Affairs Commissioner Magnus Brunner considers the program as a potential example for other European Union member countries to follow.",
      "Meanwhile, Ioannides repeated that a 2009 Search and Rescue agreement that Cyprus has with Syria enables Cypriot authorities to send back boatloads of Syrian migrants trying to reach the island nation after they\u2019re rescued in international waters.",
      "Ioannides said that two inflatable boats each loaded with 30 Syrian migrants were turned back in line with the bilateral agreement after being rescued when they transmitted that they were in danger.",
      "Ioannides again denied Cyprus engages in any pushbacks, despite urgings from both the U.N. refugee agency and Europe\u2019s top human rights body to stop pushing back migrants trying to reach the island by boat.",

      "The Spanish king and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who also attended Thursday's ceremony, pushed for stronger European defense as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to pull back America's protection commitments to the continent, upending the post-World War II order that has formed the basis for global stability and security.",
      "\u2033A clear message is coming out of Washington: Europeans ought to do more to provide for the defense of their own continent,\" Felipe said. \"We should not underestimate how consequential this message is.

      "Merz, whose election earlier this month was seen as a reemergence of Germany's status as a diplomatic and economic heavyweight, brought up U.S. Vice President JD Vance's comments at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year. Vance, \u201cin his own very special way,\" confronted what Europeans stand for, Merz said.",
      "Vance at the time complained about the state of democracy and free speech in Europe, and lambasted German political parties \u2014 days before a national election \u2014 for their so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d against working with far-right parties.",
      "\"We actually stand for what we have been able to develop, to design, what we have actually fought for during centuries -- and despite many backlashes and disasters -- that we actually defend what is dear to us and important: freedom and democracy,\u201d Merz said.",

      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",

      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",

      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",

    "story": [
      "On a hillside northwest of Los Angeles, Andreas Tompros is replanting hundreds of avocado trees",
      "SOMIS, Calif. -- Andreas Tompros lost his home and at least a third of his avocado orchard to a wildfire last year, but the 47-year-old grower is not worried about his farm making a comeback.",
      "While California farmers often rattle off a list of challenges they face including high labor costs, water restrictions and overseas competition, many avocado growers say they have a good thing going. A key reason may come as a surprise to some \u2014 Mexican imports.",
      "When the United States lifted its ban on Mexican avocados in 1997, California growers worried at first that the imported fruit would displace their production.",
      "But the steady flow of avocados has wound up helping, not hurting, their sales by allowing for a year-round supply to markets and restaurants that has fomented demand, farmers say. Before the influx, most American consumers considered avocados to be specialty items \u2014 and when they came into season in California, industry officials had to work to rev up widespread interest in order to sell them.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Avocado consumption has been booming in the United States over the past two decades. The amount of fruit available per person tripled to more than 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) between 2000 and 2021, federal statistics show. Avocado toast and guacamole are regular offerings not just in culinary hubs like NYC but at cafes around the Midwest and the South.",
      "On a steep, sun-soaked hillside northwest of Los Angeles, Tompros is replanting nearly 300 avocado trees with the belief that Americans\u2019 hunger for the fruit \u2014 and his orchard \u2014 will continue to grow.",
      "\u201cIt will come back, and I believe it will become better than it was,\u201d Tompros, who previously ran a software company in Hollywood, said of the orchard he took over five years ago in the tiny community of Somis.",
      "Avocado demand has also been buoyed by consumers' growing interest in healthy fats, said Emiliano Escobedo, executive director of the Hass Avocado Board.",
      "A 2000 U.S. law created the board that collected 2.5 cents for every pound (0.5 kilograms) of avocados imported or produced in the United States. The board used the money to market avocados and conduct nutritional research, an effort that has been widely credited with making the fruit ubiquitous in supermarkets and on restaurant menus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been really wildly successful. It generates way more money than most of these other industry boards do,\u201d said Richard Sexton, distinguished professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. \u201cWhen you look at the growth rate in avocado consumption relative to all fruits, the difference in growth rate is dramatic.\u201d",
      "Escobedo said about 60% of U.S. households currently buy avocados, and about half of these are responsible for the overwhelming majority of consumption, which means there\u2019s still room for the market to grow \u2014 especially in the Northeast, where the fruit is less common.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of opportunity for certain groups of people to increase their purchasing of avocados,\u201d Escobedo said.",
      "While the Trump administration has threatened tariffs on a spate of Mexican goods, avocados have so far been spared. California growers said they want Mexican avocados to keep flowing into the country, though they also want robust U.S. inspections of the imports to keep out pests to protect their crop.",
      "\u201cIf you are going to farm in California, avocados are about the best deal right now,\u201d said Ken Melban, president of the California Avocado Commission.",
      "California farmers grow about 10% of the avocados eaten in the United States, Melban said, and account for nearly all of the country\u2019s domestic avocado production. The fruit is largely grown in California from April through September, and Mexican imports arrive year-round to meet nationwide demand, which exceeds what the state's farmers grow, he said.",
      "In Southern California's Ventura County, many growers have shifted to avocados since lemon prices were walloped by cheaper imports from Argentina. As recently planted trees start bearing fruit in a few years, the region's avocado production is likely to rise, said Korinne Bell, agricultural commissioner for the county northwest of Los Angeles.",
      "Avocado trees do not come without risks in a region prone to wildfires.",
      "Still, demand for the trees has jumped due to interest from lemon growers \u2014 and since the November 2024 fire charred Ventura County avocado orchards, said Rob Brokaw, whose family-owned nursery has supplied avocado trees to California growers for 70 years.",
      "\u201cRight now we are sold out essentially for this year,\u201d Brokaw said. \u201cAnd we're mostly sold out for 2026.\u201d",
      "Tompros debated whether to plant the more fire-resistant lemon trees or another crop after the fire ripped through Somis, but he decided to replant due to the soaring demand for Super Bowl guacamole and avocado toast.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the super food, and it\u2019s still growing in popularity,\u201d Tompros said.",
      "He\u2019s taking precautions to not plant the trees too close to what will eventually be his rebuilt home, because the dried-out leaves that help nourish the orchard's soil can also fuel blazes.",
      "It may take a few years, but Tompros hopes it won\u2019t be too long before his newly planted trees bear fruit that he can sell to a local packinghouse or in seasonal gift boxes with citrus and passionfruit that he ships directly to customers.",

    "story": [
      "Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality",
      "COUNSELOR, N.M. -- On a Tuesday in March, Billton Werito drove his son Amari toward his house in Counselor, New Mexico, navigating the bumpy dirt road that winds through a maze of natural gas pipelines, wellheads and water tanks. Amari should have been in school, but a bout of nausea and a dull headache kept him from class.",
      "\u201cIt happens a lot,\u201d Amari explained from the backseat, glancing up from his Nintendo Switch. The symptoms usually show up when the sixth-grader smells an odor of \u201crotten egg with propane\u201d that rises from nearby natural gas wells and wafts over Lybrook Elementary School, where he and some 70 other Navajo students attend class. His little brother often misses school for the same reason.",
      "\u201cThey just keep getting sick,\u201d Amari\u2019s father, Billton, said. \u201cI have to take them out of class because of the headaches. Especially the younger one, he\u2019s been throwing up and won\u2019t eat.\u201d The symptoms are putting the kids at risk of falling further behind in school.",
      "Lybrook sits in the heart of New Mexico\u2019s San Juan Basin, a major oil and gas deposit that, along with the Permian Basin in the state\u2019s southeast, is supplying natural gas that meets much of the nation\u2019s electricity demand.",
      "The gas pulled from tens of thousands of wells in New Mexico has reaped huge benefits for the entire country. Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality. Locally, oil and gas companies employ thousands of workers, often in areas with few other opportunities, all while boosting the state\u2019s budget with billions in royalty payments.",
      "But those benefits may come at a cost for thousands of students in New Mexico whose schools sit near oil and gas pipelines, wellheads and flare stacks. An Associated Press analysis of state and federal data found 694 oil and gas wells with new or active permits within a mile of a school in the state. This means that around 29,500 students in 74 schools and pre-schools potentially face exposure to noxious emissions, as extraction from the ground can release unhealthy fumes.",
      "At Lybrook, where Amari just finished sixth grade, fewer than 6% of students are proficient at math, and only a fifth meet state standards for science and reading proficiency.",
      "Other factors could help explain students\u2019 poor achievement. Poverty rates are higher in some areas with high levels of gas development, and students at rural schools overall tend to face challenges that can adversely affect academic performance. AP\u2019s analysis found that two-thirds of the schools within a mile of an oil or gas well were low-income, and the population is around 24% Native American and 45% Hispanic.",
      "But research has found that student learning is directly harmed by air pollution from fossil fuels \u2014 even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account.",
      "And it\u2019s not just New Mexico where this is a risk. An AP analysis of data from the Global Oil and Gas Extraction Tracker found over 1,000 public schools across 13 states that are within five miles of a major oil or gas field. Major fields are collections of wells that produce the highest amount of energy in a state.",
      "\u201cThis kind of air pollution has a real, measurable effect on students,\u201d said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, who studies connections between air quality and student performance.",
      "In 2024, Gilraine cowrote a study showing that student test scores were closely associated with air contamination. Each measured increase in PM2.5, a type of pollution created from the burning of fossil fuels, was associated with a significant decline in student test scores, Gilraine found. Conversely, researchers have documented that reductions in air pollution have led to higher test scores and fewer absences.",
      "\u201cTo me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects\u201d of air pollution on students, Gilraine said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s shift to natural gas has resulted in substantial increases in student achievement nationwide, Gilraine\u2019s research shows, as it has displaced dirtier coal and led to cleaner air on the whole. But there has been little data on air quality across New Mexico, even as it has become one of the most productive states in the nation for natural gas. State regulators have installed only 20 permanent air monitors, most in areas without oil or gas production.",
      "Independent researchers have extensively studied the air quality near schools in at least two locations in the state, however. One is Lybrook, which sits within a mile of 17 active oil and gas wells.",
      "In 2024, scientists affiliated with Princeton and Northern Arizona universities conducted an air-monitoring study at the school, finding that levels of pollutants \u2014 including benzene, a cancer-causing byproduct of natural gas production that is particularly harmful to children \u2014 were spiking during school hours, to nearly double the levels known to cause chronic or acute health effects.",
      "That research followed a 2021 health impact assessment that was done with support from several local nonprofits and foundations, which analyzed the effects of the area\u2019s oil and gas development on residents.",
      "The findings were startling: More than 90% of people surveyed suffered from sinus problems. Nosebleeds, shortness of breath and nausea were widespread. The report attributed the symptoms to the high levels of pollutants that researchers found \u2014 including, near Lybrook, hydrogen sulfide, a compound that gives off the sulfur smell that Amari Werito associated with his headaches.",
      "Those studies helped confirm what many community members already knew, said Daniel Tso, a community leader who served on the committee that oversaw the 2021 health impact assessment.",
      "\u201cThe children and the grandchildren need a safe homeland,\u201d Tso said during an interview in March, standing outside a cluster of gas wells within a mile of Lybrook Elementary.",
      "\u201cYou smell that?\u201d he said, nodding towards a nearby wellhead, which smelled like propane. \u201cThat\u2019s what the kids at the school are breathing in. I\u2019ve had people visiting this area from New York. They spend five minutes here and say, \u2018Hey, I got a headache.\u2019 And the kids are what, six hours a day at the school breathing this?\u201d",
      "Lybrook school officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Researchers have identified similar air quality problems in New Mexico\u2019s southeast.",
      "In 2023, a team of scientists from a coalition of universities conducted a detailed, yearlong study of the air in Loving, a small town in the Permian Basin. Local air quality, researchers found, was worse than in downtown Los Angeles, and the tested air contained the fifth-highest level of measured ozone contamination in the U.S.",
      "The source of the ozone \u2014 a pollutant that\u2019s especially hazardous to children \u2014 was the area\u2019s network of gas wells and related infrastructure. Some of that infrastructure sits within a half-mile of a campus that houses Loving\u2019s elementary, middle and high schools.",
      "A small group of residents has spoken out about the area\u2019s air quality, saying it has caused respiratory problems and other health issues. But for most locals, any concerns about pollution are outweighed by the industry\u2019s economic benefits.",
      "Representatives of the oil and gas industry have claimed the air quality studies themselves are not trustworthy.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a robust study to actually answer these questions,\u201d said Andrea Felix, vice president of regulatory affairs for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA). Felix said other sources of emissions, such as cars and trucks, are likely a larger source of air quality problems near wells.",
      "\u201cCompanies follow the best available science\u201d for well placement and emissions controls, Felix said, and also contribute huge amounts of money to the state\u2019s education budget through streams like royalties and direct expenditures. In the most recent fiscal year, oil and gas revenue supported $1.7 billion in K-12 spending in New Mexico, according to a NMOGA report.",
      "Officials with Loving Municipal Schools are also skeptical of the alarm over the wells. Loving Superintendent Lee White said the school district used funds from the oil and gas industry to pay for a new wing at the elementary school, a science lab for students, turf on the sports field and training and professional development for teachers. He said the industry\u2019s contributions to state coffers can\u2019t be ignored.",
      "\u201cAre we willing to give that up because people say our air is not clean?\u201d he said during an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just as clean as anywhere else.\u201d",
      "As White spoke, a drill rig worked a couple of miles east of Loving\u2019s elementary school while parents poured into the gymnasium to watch kindergartners collect their diplomas. White touted the district\u2019s success, saying the elementary school scores above state averages for reading, math and science proficiency, while Loving\u2019s high school students far outpace the state average for college and career readiness.",
      "But environmental groups, attorneys and residents continue to push for limits on drilling near schools.",
      "Those efforts saw a boost in 2023, when New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard issued an executive order prohibiting new oil and gas leases on state-owned land within a mile of schools.",
      "Industry representatives decried the move, saying it added potentially insurmountable costs and barriers to drilling operators. However, AP\u2019s analysis found that relatively few wells would be impacted even if the rule applied to all of New Mexico; only around 1% of oil and gas wells in the state are within a mile of a school.",
      "In the years since, residents of areas where exploration is heavy have lobbied for legislation prohibiting gas operations within a mile of schools, regardless of land status. That bill died in committee during the most recent session of the New Mexico legislature.",
      "Advocates have also sued the state over an alleged lack of pollution controls. That suit is currently pending in state court.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s central bank cut its key interest rate and sharply lowered its growth outlook for the country\u2019s economy in 2025, as it moved Thursday to counter U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by recent political turmoil.",
      "Following a monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.5%. It was its fourth cut since October, when it began lowering borrowing costs for the first time in years to support a weakening economy. The bank slashed its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, nearly halving its previous projection of 1.5% announced in February.",
      "Share prices jumped, with the Kospi gaining 1.7%.",
      "Although trade tensions have recently eased, the global economy is still expected to slow due to the lingering effects of increased tariffs. U.S.-China friction over trade and geopolitical uncertainties will continue to weigh on markets, the bank said in a statement.",
      "South Korea\u2019s domestic economic activity remained sluggish in April following a contraction in the first quarter driven by weak consumption and business investment, the bank said. It said job creation in manufacturing and other sectors was slow.",
      "Since beginning his second term, Trump has vowed to slap huge new tariffs on foreign products entering the United States, including those from Mexico, Canada and China, which he insists will create more domestic jobs and shrink the federal deficit.",
      "In recent weeks, South Korea has sent trade officials to Washington to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and potential product-specific duties on semiconductors and cars, which are major exports for the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "A decision by a U.S. federal court saying Trump lacks the legal authority to impose such tariffs could upset his plans, but the White House has appealed and it's unclear what will happen in the longer run.",
      "Experts say South Korea's leverage in trade talks and its ability to tackle domestic economic challenges have been undermined by political instability after former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ill-fated imposition of martial law in December. Yoon was formally ousted from office in April, setting the stage for a snap presidential election next week.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs.",
      "The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, rattled financial markets and raised the risk of higher prices and recession in the United States and around the world.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over civil cases involving trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "The court\u2019s decision blocks the tariffs Trump slapped last month on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "On April 2, Trump imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else. He later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to agree to reduce barriers to U.S. exports. But he kept the baseline tariffs in place. Claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, he justified the taxes under IEEPA by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.",
      "The tariffs are being challenged in at least seven lawsuits. In the ruling Wednesday, the trade court combined two of the cases \u2014 one brought by five small businesses and another by 12 U.S. states.",
      "The ruling does leave in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But those levies were invoked under a different law that required a Commerce Department investigation and could not be imposed at the president\u2019s own discretion.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic and financial crisis that arose when the United States suddenly devalued the dollar by ending a policy that linked the U.S. currency to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEPPA.",
      "The court disagreed, deciding that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs exceeded his authority to regulate imports under IEEPA. It also said the tariffs did nothing to deal with problems they were supposed to address. In their case, the states noted that America's trade deficits hardly amount of a sudden emergency. The United States has racked them up for 49 straight years in good times and bad.",
      "Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says the court's decision \"throws the president\u2019s trade policy into turmoil.\u201d",
      "\u201cPartners negotiating hard during the 90-day day tariff pause period may be tempted to hold off making further concessions to the U.S. until there is more legal clarity,\" she said.",
      "Likewise, companies will have to reassess the way they run their supply chains, perhaps speeding up shipments to the United States to offset the risk that the tariffs will be reinstated on appeal.",
      "The trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and only for 150 days with countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.",
      "For now, the trade court's ruling \u201cdestroys the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for using federal emergency powers to impose tariffs, which oversteps congressional authority and contravenes any notion of due process,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"The ruling makes it clear that the broad tariffs imposed unilaterally by Trump represent an overreach of executive power.''",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s presidential race has devolved into personal attacks and petty disputes, drowning out meaningful policy debate after former conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ouster over his martial law fiasco.",
      "The bitter mudslinging between liberal frontrunner Lee Jae-myung and conservative opponent Kim Moon Soo escalated during Tuesday night\u2019s final presidential debate, with Lee branding Kim \u201cYoon Suk Yeol\u2019s avatar\u201d and Kim denouncing Lee as a \u201charbinger of monster politics and dictatorship.\"",
      "Here is a look at the words and controversies that have roiled the presidential contest as two days of early voting begins Thursday ahead of the June 3 election:",
      "Consistently trailing Lee in opinion polls, Kim has focused on dredging up his legal troubles and casting the outspoken Democratic Party candidate as a dangerous, hardline populist whose economic promises are detached from reality.",
      "For days, Kim\u2019s camp has seized on what appeared to be a casual comment by Lee about the profitability of running coffee shops during a May 16 campaign rally in Gunsan city.",
      "Lee was touting his past policy as Gyeonggi Province governor in 2019, when he relocated unlicensed food vendors from the province's popular mountain streams to clean up and revitalize tourist areas.",
      "Lee said he offered to help vendors transition to legitimate businesses and suggested it would be far more profitable to sell coffee than their labor-intensive chicken porridge. Lee said he noted that a cup of coffee could sell for 8,000 to 10,000 won ($5.8 to $7.3), while the raw cost of beans was just 120 won (9 cents).",
      "The remarks quickly struck a nerve in a country where the rapid spread of small coffee shops has come to symbolize the struggles of the self-employed in a decaying job market.",
      "Kim's People Power Party accused Lee of \u201cdriving a nail into the hearts of small business owners\u201d by portraying coffee shops as profiteering and said he misunderstood the factors behind retail pricing.",
      "Lee accused the conservatives of distorting his remarks, saying he was simply explaining how he had helped vendors operate in a better environment.",
      "Kim's avoidance of direct criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree has been a major source of Lee's political offensive against him.",
      "When Yoon appeared May 21 to view a documentary film justifying his martial law decree and raising unfounded claims about how the liberals benefited from election fraud, some PPP members lamented he was practically campaigning for Lee.",
      "Kim, formerly Yoon's labor minister, only said he would do his best as president to eliminate suspicions of alleged election fraud.",
      "Kim also has not offered any notable reaction to various scandals surrounding Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Prosecutors in Seoul are investigating fresh allegations that the former first lady received luxury gifts, including two Chanel bags, from a Unification Church official seeking business favors after Yoon took office in 2022.",
      "She previously faced several other allegations including receiving a Dior bag from a Korean American pastor and involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme.",
      "During the presidential debate, Lee claimed Yoon would return as a \u201cshadow ruler\u201d behind Kim, and Kim skirted Lee's question about whether he would pardon Yoon.",
      "The \u201croom salon\u201d is a long-standing symbol of South Korea\u2019s male-oriented nightlife culture. The expensive, private karaoke bar where hostesses drink and sing with male customers abruptly emerged as a hot election issue.",
      "Lee\u2019s party alleged a judge handling Yoon\u2019s rebellion trial visited one of the bars in affluent southern Seoul last year with two unidentified people. It said his companions paid the bill and they were likely linked to his work as a judge, representing a conflict of interest.",
      "The judge, Jee Kui-youn, has been at the center of bipartisan wrangling since he approved Yoon\u2019s release from prison in March and allowed him to stand his trial without physical detention.",
      "\u201cWe should strip him of his judge robe,\" party spokesperson Noh Jongmyun said. \"Isn\u2019t it preposterous for him to serve as chief judge for the rebellion trial where the fate of Korea\u2019s democracy lies?\u201d",
      "Jee denied the allegations, saying that like many ordinary people he enjoys \u201csamgyeopsal,\u201d grilled pork bellies, and \u201csomaek,\u201d shots mixing beer and the traditional Korean liquor soju.",
      "Conservative critics accuse the Democratic Party of trying to tame the judiciary branch as Lee faces five criminal trials over corruption and other allegations.",
      "South Korea does not hold a second round of runoff elections. Subsequently, when there is a clear frontrunner it is common for two remaining rivals to launch a unified campaign in which one withdraws and supports the other in exchange for a high-profile role in the government.",
      "With Lee maintaining a solid lead, this year\u2019s race saw a similar maneuver among conservatives, but the extremely chaotic, undemocratic manner failed and hurt Kim's campaign.",
      "Believing Han Duck-soo, Yoon\u2019s former prime minister, had a better chance of defeating Lee, PPP leaders consisting primarily of Yoon loyalists held late night, emergency meetings to cancel Kim\u2019s nomination and push a candidacy by Han, an independent. The attempt was rejected the next day in a vote by party members.",
      "Kim called the move \u201can overnight political coup\" and later made efforts to align with Lee Joon-seok, the candidate of the smaller conservative party. Lee has flatly rejected the overture.",

    "story": [
      "Mining company Signal Peak Energy sits atop a billion-ton coal reserve beneath Montana\u2019s rugged Bull Mountains and ships 98% of the fuel it mines to Japan and South Korea",
      "ROUNDUP, Mont. -- Former ranch hand Pat Thiele has spent years fighting a losing battle against a massive coal mine creeping underground toward his central Montana property.",
      "Mine owner Signal Peak Energy sits atop a billion-ton reserve of coal in the Bull Mountains, not far from where Thiele lives. The mine has long seemed poised to benefit from President Donald Trump's pledges to revive the faltering coal industry \u2014 vows the president has renewed vigorously in his second term with new orders to deregulate mining. A Republican tax cut bill making its way through Congress contains a special carve-out provision allowing the mine to expand.",
      "But Thiele and his neighbors see a glimmer of hope in another Trump initiative, his \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to global trade. The Signal Peak mine sends 98% of the minerals it unearths to Japan and South Korea. If tariffs spark a trade war, they think it could inadvertently scuttle the mine's expansion plans \u2014 an effort their legal challenges have so far only managed to slow.",
      "In effect, an escalating trade war could undermine Trump's goal of saving coal.",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019ve got somebody to buy it, they\u2019ll keep mining,\u201d said Thiele. \u201cBut a reaction could conceivably come from Japan and South Korea saying, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re going to tariff our shipbuilding or our products, fine, we\u2019re not buying your damn coal.\u2019\u201d",
      "Thiele, 77, assessed the situation as he stood atop a hillside charred by a wildfire. The former Army Ranger who served two combat tours in Vietnam took in a commanding view of the valley below, where his small herd of cattle grazed.",
      "He's a political outlier in rural Musselshell County, Montana, where mining has been a bedrock of the economy for more than a century. It stands to benefit more than most places from Trump's efforts, which for the most part have only slowed coal's demise.",
      "Eighty-five percent of Musselshell voters backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They viewed his victory as a reprieve from former President Joe Biden\u2019s anti-coal policies, said Musselshell County Commission Chairman Robert Pancratz.",
      "But worries tariffs could undermine coal's comeback aren't confined to Trump's opponents.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that he\u2019s for coal,\u201d Pancratz said, \u201cand I believe in principle what he is trying to do with the tariffs is to make for more equitable trade.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut there may be some fall-out, you know, unintended consequences of all these things.\"",
      "Many fear the impact a trade war could have on the local economy. Experts say that's a legitimate worry.",
      "Coal analyst Seth Feaster said the implications for Signal Peak and other U.S. miners could cut two ways: Countries that don\u2019t reach a deal on tariffs could retaliate against U.S. exports, reducing demand for its coal. Or countries like South Korea and Japan could be willing to use energy supplies as leverage to reach an agreement, cementing their status as markets for western coal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the administration is very coal-forward and will use energy as a negotiating tool in whatever trade agreements it\u2019s trying to establish,\u201d Feaster said.",
      "The bulk of U.S coal mined to use as power plant fuel comes from a handful of huge pit mines in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, pitched the state\u2019s coal on a recent trade trip to Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit of a long shot, but if we don\u2019t try, there won\u2019t be any opportunity at all. And I do think that both countries have come to the realization that they can\u2019t be 100% renewable,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "Signal Peak has almost 300 workers, making it a major employer in the region. Taxes and other payments by the company account for about a third of Musselshell County\u2019s revenue.",
      "Several years ago, the mine was the subject of a broad corruption investigation that led to convictions of former mine employees and associates for embezzlement, tax evasion, bank fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking and firearms violations. In 2021, the company pleaded guilty to violating environmental and employee safety regulations under an agreement with federal prosecutors that included a $1 million fine.",
      "Signal Peak CEO Parker Phipps was asked about the mine\u2019s criminal record by Rep. Yassamin Ansari during a congressional hearing last week.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of company that Republicans want to sell off our federal lands to without proper review, especially of the climate impacts,\u201d said the Arizona Democrat. \u201cFrankly, I think that\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d",
      "Phipps said the investigations were before his time and that the company ultimately cooperated with authorities. The coal executive warned the company could \u201cbegin winding operations down\u201d at the end of 2025 unless the expansion is approved.",
      "Montana Republican Rep. Troy Downing, who sponsored the House provision to allow the mine to expand, acknowledged during an interview that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs causes \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt really comes down to, forgive me for saying this, the art of the deal,\u201d Downing said, referring to Trump's book touting his business acumen. \u201cLook at what President Trump has been doing in actually getting trading partners to the table.\u201d",
      "Global coal production reached an all-time high last year, approaching roughly 10 billion tons (more than 9 billion metric tons) and dampening international efforts to curb emissions from burning a fuel that scientists say is a major contributor to global warming. Much of that growth was driven by Asia, where new coal plants keep springing up to power expanding economies.",
      "The U.S. coal industry, meanwhile, has been on an almost two-decade decline as more domestic utilities switch to cleaner fuels. That means exports account for a growing share of revenue. They topped 100 million tons last year after previously peaking under former President Barack Obama.",
      "Even if tariffs don\u2019t hurt U.S. miners, efforts by U.S. coal companies to capitalize on international demand have long been hindered by a lack of access to West Coast ports. Hauling it hundreds of miles by rail, then across the Pacific Ocean, drives up the cost of exporting coal.",
      "\u201cMost of it\u2019s pure geography. The coal, there\u2019s no problem with selling the coal, but the problem is you\u2019ve got, you know, a thousand miles of rail to get it to the nearest port,\u201d said Andrew Blumenfeld, a coal industry analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.",
      "Signal Peak solved that problem by securing a rail route that allows it to ship through a Canadian port in British Columbia. Trump's rocky relationship with Canada could complicate things on that front.",
      "Weary from the long fight to save his land, Thiele has become a realist. This isn't the first time he's had a reason to think the Bull Mountains mine might close.",
      "There was the 2008 financial crisis, when coal demand plummeted. Then came the COVID pandemic that rocked economies and industries worldwide. And the back-and-forth between Republican and Democratic administrations in Washington has added to the unpredictability.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got involved in trying to defend myself here, I had hopes we could actually stop the mine and close it,\u201d he said.",
      "Now he greets the possibility that a trade war could do what the long legal fight couldn't with hard-earned skepticism.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a faint hope,\" he said.",

      "The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, in a social media post, called it the \u201cultimate \u2018bait and switch\u2019, first promising governance reforms following the Russian anti-doping scandal and then quietly changing the rules the second the world looked away.\u201d",
      "WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald outlined the rules changes made in 2023, which did away with the tradition of having a president represent either sports organizations or governments, each of which represent 50% of WADA\u2019s main policy-making board. When Banka was first elected, he was a government candidate, but is now considered an independent candidate.",
      "\u201cThis change ... was done in order to accommodate the introduction of an initial cooling-off period and the formal election process for those positions,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cIt was also done to harmonize the nine-year term limit with other members of the WADA Foundation Board and Executive Committee.\u201d",
      "Banka said he was \u201cdeeply honored\u201d to be tabbed for a third term.",

      "\u201cThe fact that you need letters of support to run for an independent office does not seem particularly democratic,\u201d Warners told ARD. \u201dEspecially since it is not at all clear how you are supposed to obtain this support. In practice, this means that candidates can be excluded from the outset \u2014 and that is exactly what has happened here.\"",

      "There hasn't been a team in NBA history with at least 12 wins by 30 points or more in a season \u2014 or with four such wins in a single postseason \u2014 until now. The Thunder are putting together one of the most dominant years in league history in terms of outscoring opponents. The most recent entry on that list: a 124-94 romp over Minnesota to clinch the Western Conference title, a score that probably could have been a lot worse if the Thunder were so inclined.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t our goal,\" Thunder guard, NBA MVP and West finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start the season like we want to win the West. We want to win the NBA championship. Now we are a step closer to our goal and we\u2019re happy about that. But it\u2019s still four more games to go win, four really hard games to go win and we have to be the best version of ourselves for four nights to reach the ultimate goal.\u201d",

      "The biggest point differential per game in NBA history, including playoffs, was posted by the 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks \u2014 who outscored teams by 12.6 points per game.",
      "The Thunder are winning by 12.5 per game when counting the regular season and the playoffs (the NBA Cup championship game, by league rule, doesn't figure into any official stats that are kept).",
      "That's the second-biggest rate in league history, for now.",
      "They have beaten 28 of the 29 other NBA teams by double figures at least once this season. The only team to avoid that fate against the Thunder was Golden State, which actually outscored Oklahoma City by an average of 4.7 points per game in their head-to-head matchups.",
      "\u201cThey embody everything it means to be a team,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"And so, they deserve this. They deserve the opportunity that we have now. I couldn\u2019t be happier for them because they invest so much in their own games, but they also invest so much in each other and in the team. And I just think it\u2019s a really uncommon thing in professional basketball that they\u2019ve built.\u201d",

      "Oklahoma City\u2019s eight 30-point wins in the regular season came against teams that all missed the playoffs; Toronto, Washington, Sacramento, Phoenix, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Utah. But to do it four times in the playoffs speaks to the ability the Thunder have to simply run away from quality opposition.",

    "story": [
      "The dynamic duo of Skylar Diggins and Nneka Ogwumike is ecstatic about this season with a high-powered Seattle Storm roster",
      "SEATTLE -- Shortly before the Seattle Storm broke for training camp, veteran guard Skylar Diggins exuded some bravado when assessing the franchise\u2019s roster ahead of the 2025 WNBA season.",
      "\u201cHell yeah I feel confident! Did you see our roster?\u201d Diggins said. \u201cBut no, this is definitely the most talented roster I\u2019ve been a part of in my 13 years, 11 on the court.\u201d",
      "As Diggins, 34, astutely noted, she\u2019s been around the block. The six-time All-Star has laced her sneakers up for some stellar teams, and the Storm have the makings of being one, too. Seattle is off to a 3-2 start, which includes a commanding 20-point victory over the Las Vegas Aces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great combination of players,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cEverybody knows what they\u2019re good at. Our spacing has been great. People have been picking up really quickly on things.\u201d",
      "Suffice to say, year two of Diggins partnering with fellow superstar Nneka Ogwumike and playing under coach Noelle Quinn has gone well so far. The first year of that power dynamic wasn\u2019t too shabby, either; Diggins assisted on a Storm franchise-record 570 points, and Seattle qualified for the playoffs after missing them entirely and going 11-29 in 2023.",
      "Still, the Storm were bounced by the Aces in the first round, leaving significant room for improvement in 2025.",
      "Ogwumike, 34, who inked another one-year deal in February, feels increasingly comfortable in Seattle. She also believes the duo of her and Diggins can shepherd the Storm \u2013 which has won four WNBA championships \u2013 back to its previous heights.",
      "\u201cI think we can take it pretty far, especially because not only are we both here again, but we were both here for the first time last year,\u201d Ogwumike said. \u201cSo, we have a very shared experience and kind of memory of what we did last year and how we want to build off of it.\u201d",
      "Diggins and Ogwumike have known one another for two decades, but were exclusively opponents rather than teammates prior to last year. They combined to average 31.8 points per game last season, a collective total that very well could increase considering longtime guard Jewell Loyd was traded to the Aces this offseason.",
      "So far, Diggins and Ogwumike have combined to average 37.4 points per game. Unsurprisingly, their comfort in Quinn\u2019s offensive system only increases by the day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy playing with good players,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cA lot of us are very confident in who we are as basketball players and what we can do. And so, we kind of learn how we can complement each other and use each other to get what we want.\u201d",
      "In many ways, these two WNBA staples represent the next era of Storm basketball, and that particularly became the case when Loyd was traded to the Aces in January following some turmoil. Loyd, though, was part of each of the past two Storm championship teams in 2018 and 2020 that were paced in large part by Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart.",
      "Sure, there\u2019s a different core in the Emerald City these days, but there are some familiar faces from that string of success as well. Forward Alysha Clark is back in Seattle after five years away, and fellow forward Ezi Magbegor has only taken on a more prominent role since she was drafted in 2019.",
      "Adding 2025 No. 2 overall pick Dominique Malonga and her 6-foot-6 frame to the mix doesn\u2019t hurt matters, either, though she\u2019s been slowly brought along in the early stages of the season.",
      "\u201cWhat really sealed the deal for what could potentially be a new era was (Malonga) getting drafted here,\u201d Ogwumike said. \u201cSo, being able to be a part of a little bit of the history, but also the future too.\u201d",
      "As Diggins pointed out, there\u2019s a solid mix of both accomplished and young WNBA players on the scene in Seattle. But the buck stops with both her and Ogwumike, the latter of whom was a WNBA champion in 2016 with the Los Angeles Sparks.",
      "Diggins, meanwhile, is still seeking her first title \u2014 and joined the Storm in large part two winters ago because of her belief in the franchise\u2019s capabilities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a great landing spot for free agents and winning basketball,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cWe just want to continue to build off our plus-14 win (improvement) season last year that we did and just continue to position us where we want to be, and that\u2019s contending for a championship.\u201d",

A year earlier, at the 1984 European Cup final in Rome, Liverpool supporters were attacked by their Roma counterparts after the game.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a case of revenge,\u201d Tony Evans, a Liverpool fan who was at Heysel at age 24, told The Associated Press, \u201cbut rather no ultra will ever do this to me again.\u201d",
      "Adding to the potential for catastrophe at the 1985 final was the condition of Heysel, a 55,000-capacity structure with outdated standing-room only stands, flimsy chicken-wire fences and crumbling walls inside and outside the stadium. There were too few police officers present, and organizers arranged for there to be a section for \u201cneutral\u201d fans beside one of the two stands holding Liverpool supporters at one end of the ground.",
      "Many Juve fans ended up getting tickets in the \u201cneutral\u201d section \u2014 and that's where the tragedy occurred.",
      "Evans attended the match with family and friends and remembers the level of drunkenness among Liverpool fans was unlike anything he\u2019d seen.",
      "\u201cPeople were out of control everywhere,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen you got to the ground, people were kicking holes in the wall to climb in. By then, the atmosphere had deteriorated and there were wild rumors going round that Liverpool fans had been stabbed and one had been hung.\u201d",
      "Evans, who has written about Heysel in two books, \u201cFar Foreign Land\u201d and \u201cTwo Tribes,\u201d recalls the Liverpool section being so overcrowded that fans were already spilling through a collapsed barrier into the \u201cneutral\u201d section.",
      "Fans were seen throwing beer cans and chunks of concrete torn from the stands.",
      "What ultimately set off a fatal surge by Liverpool fans, Evans said, was flares being set off.",
      "\u201cThat seemed to spark a huge panic, a charge down the front,\u201d he said.",
      "Those fleeing the panic were crushed in the corner of the neutral section next to an old wall, which collapsed.",
      "Despite the chaos, organizers decided the final should be played, believing it would prevent further disorder between fans outside the stadium. Juventus won 1-0.",
      "Some 26 Liverpool fans were arrested and charged with manslaughter, 14 of whom were found guilty and given three-year prison sentences.",
      "Suspended prison sentences were handed to a Belgian Football Association official and a police chief.",
      "Heysel never hosted another major game. It was torn down in 1994 and replaced with King Baudouin Stadium.",
      "In terms of sporting sanctions, English clubs were banned from playing in European competition for five years. Liverpool received an indefinite suspension that ultimately lasted for six years.",
      "Heysel was \u201cthe low point for the English game\u201d that was hated by the British government \u201cfor its internationally shaming events,\u201d according to John Williams, an expert in the sociology of football at the University of Leicester.",
      "Fans voted with their feet, with crowds in the English league in the 1985-86 season plummeting to around 16 million \u2014 a post-war low \u2014 when they had once been two and a half times that, Williams said.",
      "Yet Williams said Heysel started the process of reflection among English soccer fans that something needed to change. Within a decade \u2014 and turbo-charged by another stadium tragedy when Liverpool fans were crushed at an FA Cup match at Hillsborough, leading to the death of 97 people \u2014 the English game would have all-seater stadiums, CCTV, stronger powers for the police, an alcohol ban inside grounds, a national organization of fans, the Premier League and be the envy of the rest of Europe.",
      "\u201cIronically, in many ways it was England that benefitted most from Heysel in the long run, more than for the Italians and others in Europe,\u201d Williams said.",
      "He referred to what authorities abroad call the \u201cEnglish miracle \u2014 the managing of fans competently with stewards rather than police and the generally very low levels of disorder in new elite modern stadia.\u201d",
      "For Evans, fans took a deep breath and stepped away from \u201cthe abyss.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a natural development by the people who watched the game and realized if this sort of behavior that had characterized the first half of the 1980s continued, football would be dead within a decade,\u201d Evans said. \u201cEveryone says Hillsborough was the determining factor, but the reality is the tides of history had changed four years before.\u201d",
      "Liverpool and Juventus were unveiling memorials on Thursday in honor of the Heysel victims to mark the 40th anniversary.",
      "For Liverpool, the occasion would be even more poignant coming just days after a minivan plowed into dozens of fans during the team\u2019s latest Premier League victory parade.",
      "Liverpool said its newly designed memorial at Anfield will feature \"two scarves knotted together and gently tied \u2014 symbolizing the unity and solidarity between the two clubs and the bond formed through shared grief and mutual respect in the aftermath of the disaster.\" It will include the names of the 39 people who died.",
      "Juventus ' memorial will be near its stadium and training complex.",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees will have a good head of steam as they bus 30 miles up the 5 Freeway for their World Series rematch against the Los Angeles Dodgers this weekend.",
      "New York's 1-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday night gave the AL East leaders 16 wins in 20 games.",
      "Clarke Schmidt continued a six-week stretch of superb starting pitching with six shutout innings, and Anthony Volpe drove in the only run with a first-inning sacrifice fly as the Yankees (35-20) completed a three-game sweep and sent the Angels (25-30) to their fifth straight loss.",
      "A Yankees rotation that lost ace Gerrit Cole to season-ending elbow surgery and has two other starters \u2014 Luis Gil and Marcus Stroman \u2014 on the injured list has a major league-best 2.54 ERA over the last 40 games and has limited opponents to one run or less in 22 of those starts.",
      "Left-hander Ryan Yarbrough allowed one run and two hits in six innings of Monday night\u2019s 5-1 win over the Angels, left-hander Carlos Rodon gave up five hits in seven scoreless innings of Tuesday\u2019s 3-2 win, and Schmidt, a right-hander, gave up four hits in his six shutout innings Wednesday night.",
      "Left-hander Max Fried, who is 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA in 11 starts, will pitch Friday night\u2019s series opener against the Dodgers, and right-hander Will Warren, who is 3-2 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 starts, is scheduled to pitch Saturday.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve given us a chance to win every single night,\u201d said Yankees reliever Mark Leiter Jr., who notched his second save with a scoreless ninth inning Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cEach guy is going out there and doing it a little different way, putting their own spin on it, which is great for us, because it gives them a different look for six or seven innings, and we get to do our thing with a different look for the last couple innings. You\u2019re only as good as your starting pitching, generally, and they\u2019ve been great.\u201d",
      "The NL West-leading Dodgers (34-22) have three frontline starters \u2014 Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow and Roki Sasaki \u2014 and four high-leverage relievers \u2014 Blake Treinen, Evan Phillips, Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates \u2014 on the injured list.",
      "But they still have plenty of star power, with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, who have combined to win five MVP awards, plus Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez and Will Smith at the top of their lineup.",
      "\u201cYeah, it will feel big,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of the matchup. \u201cNow, we won\u2019t go in treating it any differently, but we played the Subway Series (against the New York Mets) last week, and there was a lot of hype for that. I think these are good things for our guys to play in and experience.\u201d",
      "The series will feature two of the best players in baseball in Judge and Ohtani, both coming off an MVP season.",
      "Judge, who has won two American League MVPs, leads the AL in batting average (.391), on-base percentage (.488), slugging percentage (.739), OPS (1.227) and hits (81). He is tied for third in the majors in home runs (18) and ranks fourth in RBIs (47).",
      "Ohtani, who has won three MVPs \u2014 his first two with the Angels in 2021 and 2023 \u2014 leads the major leagues with 20 homers and 59 runs and ranks third in OPS (1.042). He produced baseball\u2019s first 50-50 season with 54 homers and 59 stolen bases in 2024.",
      "The two-way star, who has a 38-19 record and 3.01 ERA in 86 starts over five seasons but did not pitch while recovering from Tommy John surgery in 2024, is also on track to return to the mound sometime after the All-Star break.",
      "\u201cI think Judge has been the best hitter in the sport now for a number of years, but what Shohei does with his speed and, when he\u2019s healthy, being an ace on the mound, and his ability to swing the bat \u2026 we haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Boone said.",
      "\u201cOhtani, when you add in the pitching element, is just so unique, like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen in this game.\u201d",
      "Freeman, the Dodgers first baseman, hit four homers, including a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning of Game 1, and drove in 12 runs to earn World Series MVP honors last October.",
      "Freeman\u2019s two-run single also keyed a five-run rally in the fifth inning that helped the Dodgers overcome a 5-0 deficit in their series-clinching 7-6 victory in Game 5 at Yankee Stadium.",
      "The Dodgers held Ohtani to two hits in 19 at-bats (.105) and no RBIs in the World Series, but he played the final three games with a dislocated left shoulder that was surgically repaired after the season.",
      "\u201cYou have to execute (pitches) at a high level against him, or we\u2019re backing up bases or getting a new ball,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe did a pretty good job against him in the World Series last year, but he\u2019s also hit some big homers against us.\u201d",
      "The Yankees will have a Dodgers nemesis that they didn\u2019t have last October in veteran first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who signed a one-year, $12.5 million deal last winter and is batting .347 with an .899 OPS, five homers and 27 RBIs in his first 55 games with the Yankees.",
      "A former Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals slugger, Goldschmidt has a .283 average, .872 OPS, 35 homers and 109 RBIs in 163 career games against the Dodgers and a .308 average, .928 OPS, 19 homers and 50 RBIs in 77 games in Dodger Stadium.",
      "\u201cI would say he\u2019s more than an X-factor,\u201d Boone said of Goldschmidt, who led off Wednesday night\u2019s game with a double and scored on Volpe\u2019s sacrifice fly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our dudes.\u201d",

      "The Galaxy's woes have only compounded throughout the new season despite the return to health of stars Joseph Paintsil, Gabriel Pec and Marco Reus. All three international veterans played major roles on last year\u2019s championship team, but were limited by injury in the new year.",
      "Reus left in the 59th minute against San Jose after sitting down on the grass without contact and eventually walking off the field. Reus struggled with a knee injury earlier in the season, but had been playing well in recent matches.",

      "Disorganized in attack and lacking any crispness in their passing, the Galaxy still look lost without Catalan midfielder Riqui Puig, who orchestrated their excellence throughout the 2024 season before tearing a knee ligament in the conference final. Puig could return this summer, but LA also had to part with a handful of key contributors to last season\u2019s team due to the salary cap constraints created annually for the MLS champion by title bonuses in their players\u2019 contracts.",
      "The Galaxy's leadership has declined to panic during this mammoth skid, even extending Vanney's contract two weeks ago when the winless streak was at a mere 13 games.",
      "LA's Novak Micovic had to make two diving saves in the first two minutes of play, and he finished with four saves in the scoreless first half. San Jose\u2019s Ian Harkes hit the crossbar from long range in the 22nd minute.",

      "Jayden Daniels is in his second spring of NFL offseason workouts with the same coach and offense from his successful rookie year for the Washington Commanders",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- Jayden Daniels evades the topic as if he's an oncoming pass rusher and ducks away from the questions as if he's avoiding a sack.",
      "It sure looks as if the Washington Commanders' franchise quarterback has bulked up, adding some muscle after his AP Offensive Rookie of the Year season. He just won't say how much and insists it was not a particular mission of his.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up for grabs \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\" Daniels said Wednesday after an offseason practice session. \"I was just working out. It wasn\u2019t about this amount or much. Just go out there, have a plan and naturally just put on weight.\u201d",
      "Daniels is happy to let others talk about his weight, and that extends to his teammates and coaches. They notice, chalking it up to him being a competitor looking to gain another edge.",
      "Kliff Kingsbury, back for a second season as offensive coordinator, has not seen what Daniels is lifting but observes the 24-year-old looking a little thicker.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still pretty lean, but he\u2019s definitely worked really hard at his fitness and the weight room,\" Kingsbury said. \"He knows what he has to do to protect himself and where he feels comfortable playing. But the arm strength: He looks better, and you can tell he\u2019s stronger. There\u2019s no doubt.\u201d",
      "That wasn't a message from the coaching staff coming off Daniels leading the way in Washington exceeding all expectations to make the playoffs and go on an improbable run to the NFC championship game. Kingsbury wanted Daniels to get some rest rather than rush back into preparing for his second professional season.",
      "Easier said than done. A year since being the second pick in the draft and going through an entirely new process, he took some time to reflect and adjusted his priorities.",
      "\u201cYou just have so much time and freedom to kind of do what you want,\" Daniels said. \"It was difficult trying to navigate that, but you on lean on people closest to you and obviously you\u2019ve got to keep the end goal in mind. You\u2019re trying to get better each and every day, and you\u2019re trying to progress each and every season, each and every month and snap.\u201d",
      "Part of getting better was absolutely getting some more upper-body heft \u2014 especially given Daniels' penchant to escape the pocket and run for big gains and given reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia, Dallas and the New York Giants have no shortage of bruising defenders ready to hit him.",
      "\u201cPut on a little muscle, huh?\" center Tyler Biadasz said. \u201cFor sure. He said what he was going to do, and he did it.\"",
      "Daniels upon arriving in Washington developed the reputation as a player who arrives early to the team facility and stays late. No one around the Commanders anticipates that will change now that he may be a few pounds heavier.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten like side by side in the mirror or anything, but he\u2019s doing great,\" coach Dan Quinn said. \u201cYou can sense when people are going for it, and he\u2019s certainly one that is. ... There is no flinch in Jayden Daniels. He is as focused and relentless as you could (be) about getting better.\u201d",
      "Trade pickup Deebo Samuel was in attendance for organized team activities Wednesday, but fellow wide receiver Terry McLaurin was not around for the voluntary stage of offseason workouts after taking part in mandatory sessions recently. Left tackle Laremy Tunsil and cornerback Marshon Lattimore were also absent.",
      "McLaurin's camp is believed to be discussing a new contract with general manager Adam Peters. McLaurin, who turns 30 in September, is only signed through next season.",
      "\u201cI understand the business side of the things, and when he stopped coming I understand his side of the story,\" Samuel said. \u201cI just not try to get bothered with it and just let him deal with it on his own and just kind of handle it on his own.\u201d",
      "Quinn said he has been in touch with every player, plus Peters to see if there are any extension updates.",
      "\u201cThose guys have been excellent in terms of the communication with me,\u201d Quinn said. \"I can speak to Terry, specifically: He\u2019s having a great offseason.\u201d",
      "No one seems to be worried about McLaurin. Certainly not his QB.",
      "\u201cMe and Terry got a good relationship outside of football,\" Daniels said. \"He\u2019s got to handle what he has to handle, but that doesn\u2019t change anything with the fact that he\u2019s a part of our brotherhood. We know Terry\u2019s working and everything, so we got to get better and he knows he\u2019s got to get better each and every day.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "California, which is home to some of the largest tech companies in the world, will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent starting in 2027. And New York state allows parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform\u2019s algorithm.",

      "An alleged kidnapping in New York is the latest instance in which authorities say cryptocurrency-related crimes have involved real-world violence",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A man says he was tortured for weeks in a New York townhouse. Another in Paris was held for ransom and his finger cut off. A couple in Connecticut were carjacked, beaten and thrown into a van.",
      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",

Scientists aren't sure exactly where they fall in the family tree because they're not closely related to ancient Native Americans in North America and also not linked to ancient or present-day South Americans.",
      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",

      "The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.",
      "The alleged attempted robbery is known as a \u201cwrench attack.\u201d It\u2019s a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.",
      "Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency\u2019s move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,\u201d Ariss said.",
      "Some of the crypto\u2019s key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.",
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don\u2019t need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "In the case in New York, where two people have been charged, a lot of details have yet to come out, including the value of the bitcoin the victim possessed.",
      "Stealing cryptocurrency is almost as old as cryptocurrency itself, but it\u2019s usually done by hacking. North Korean state hackers alone are believed to have stolen billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in recent years.",
      "In response to the threat of hacking, holders of a large amount of crypto often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \u201ccold wallets.\u201d Used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But they can\u2019t defeat thieves who force a victim to give up their password to access their wallets and move money.",
      "The case in New York is the latest in a string of high-profile wrench attacks. Several have taken place in France, where thieves cut off a crypto executive\u2019s finger.",
      "Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.",
      "Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \u201csomething exotic\u201d and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\u201cWhile our discovery doesn\u2019t yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\u201d Wang said. \u201cEither we are uncovering something entirely new, or we\u2019re seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d",
      "Launched in 1999, Chandra orbits tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth, observing some of the hottest, high-energy objects in the universe.",

      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe.

      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",

There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",

      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",
      "Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. \u2014 but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.",
      "\u201cThere are threats to science ... south of the border,\u201d said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada\u2019s leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the \u201cCanada Leads\u201d recruitment drive. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.\u201d",
      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",
      "U.S.-based applicants in this year\u2019s recruitment round for France\u2019s Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.",
      "At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program \u2014 aimed at young female researchers \u2014 drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.",
      "Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.",
      "Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., \u201cwe are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.\u201d",
      "Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.",
      "Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he\u2019s applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,\u201d said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "But it\u2019s not easy to pick up and move a scientific career \u2014 let alone a life.",
      "Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like \u201cAmerica as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.\u201d",
      "Still, she wasn\u2019t sure of her next move. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,\u201d she said.",
      "The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide \u201cChoose Europe\u201d initiative.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.",
      "Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there\u2019s more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.",
      "\u201cScience is a global endeavor,\u201d said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators.",
      "One aim of recruitment drives is to \u201cto help prevent the loss of talent to the global scientific community,\u201d he said.",
      "Researchers worldwide will suffer if collaborations are shut down and databases taken offline, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,\u201d said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology. So the cuts and policies were \u201cvery frightening also for us because it was an example for the whole world.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has backtracked on Harvard, giving the school 30 days to challenge the administration's revocation of its ability to host international students.",
    "story": [
      "Harvard now has 30 days to respond to the Trump administration.",
      "Ahead of a federal hearing over Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, the acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a letter Thursday giving the school 30 days to challenge the administration's revocation of that certification.",
      "The letter formally notifies the school that its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification would be withdrawn -- but backtracks from the administration's earlier stance by giving Harvard 30 days to achieve compliance.",
      "\"Your school has 30 calendar days from the date of service of this Notice to submit written representations under oath and supported by documentary evidence, setting forth the reasons why SEVP should not withdraw your school's certification,\" the notice said. \"If SEVP certification is withdrawn, your school will then no longer be approved to enroll or continue to educate nonimmigrant students.\"",
      "The notice comes one week after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced she had ordered the termination of the school's SEVP certification.",
      "\"As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege,\" Noem wrote last week in a letter to the university.",
      "At a hearing Thursday shortly after the Trump administration issued its 30-day notice, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said she plans to issue a preliminary injunction that prohibits the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without first going through the legally required procedure.",
      "\"I do think an order is necessary. It doesn't need to be draconian, but I want to make sure nothing changes. I want to maintain the status quo,\" the judge said at the hearing, which took place as thousands of Harvard students and their families gathered for the school's commencement.",
      "For now, Judge Burroughs said a temporary restraining order she issued last week will remain in place until a preliminary injunction is ironed out.",
      "Burroughs said that, despite the Trump administration's backtracking, she felt an order was necessary to protect Harvard's international students.",
      "\"I would feel more comfortable given what has preceded this,\" she said during 20-minute hearing. \"It gives some protection to international students who are anxious about coming here.\"",
      "Department of Justice attorney Tiberius Davis pushed back on the restraining order, saying the issue had effectively become \"moot\" since the Trump administration changed course.",
      "\"The Department has decided it would be better, simpler going forward, to go through the procedure,\" Davis said.",
      "Despite the change, Harvard attorney Ian Gershengorn said that a restraining order was still necessary, arguing that the Trump administration was unlawfully violating the school's First Amendment rights by retaliating against the school for its decision not to budge to other demands from the government. He called the recent notice \"the next step\" in the Trump administration's campaign to retaliate against the school.",
      "\"There seems to be a different set of rules, procedures for Harvard,\" he said. \"The First Amendment harms we are suffering are real and continuing.\"",

      "Judge Burroughs suggested that the parties might end up coming back to court in a few months, once the legal process has played out, to determine if the potential revocation is retaliatory.",
      "\"By that point, we think the case would be quite different,\" Davis said.",
      "Arguing that the Trump administration actions are part of a \"campaign to coerce Harvard into surrendering its First Amendment rights,\" Harvard has alleged that the SEVP revocation is unlawful because it violates the school's free speech rights; that the policy is arbitrary and therefore violates the Administrative Procedure Act; and that the policy runs roughshod over the school's due process protections because it was not given the opportunity to respond to the revocation.",
      "\"The surrounding events, and Defendants' express statements, make clear that the Department of Homeland Security took these actions not for any valid reason, but purely as punishment for Harvard's speech, its perceived viewpoint, and its refusal to surrender its academic independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\" the school said in its lawsuit against the Trump administration.",
      "\"It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,\" said the suit.",
      "DHS officials have said that the revocation was necessary because Harvard failed to turn over information about international students -- including disciplinary records -- as requested by the Trump administration.",
      "\"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.' DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement last week.",
      "Harvard is also fighting the Trump administration's attempt to freeze more $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the school. Harvard filed a separate lawsuit to challenge the funding freeze in April, and the next hearing in that case is set for July.",
      "Trump has continued to ratchet up the pressure on the school over the last two months, threatening to revoke the school's tax-exempt status, directing his administration to cancel contracts with the school, and continuing to demand information on international students. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump suggested that Harvard should cap the number of international students to 15% of the school's total student body.",
      "\"We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can't get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,\" Trump said.",

      "In an opinion on Wednesday, the three-judge panel struck down Trump's global tariffs as \"contrary to law.\"",

      "\"The President's assertion of tariff-making authority in the instant case, unbounded as it is by any limitation in duration or scope, exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA. The Worldwide and Retaliatory tariffs are thus ultra vires and contrary to law,\" the judges wrote.",
      "According to the judges, Congress, not the president, has the authority to impose tariffs under most circumstances, and Trump's tariffs do not meet the limited condition of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" that would allow him to act alone.",
      "The Department of Justice on Thursday requested a stay, saying it's needed \"to avoid immediate irreparable harm to United States foreign policy and national security.\"",
      "\u201cIt is critical, for the country\u2019s national security and the President\u2019s conduct of ongoing, delicate diplomatic efforts, that the Court stay its judgment.

      "According to the administration, the court order would strip the president of leverage in trade negotiations, imperil the trade deals already reached, and make the country vulnerable to countries that \u201cfeel a renewed boldness to take advantage of\u201d the current situation.",
      "Responding to the ruling, White House spokesman Kush Desai evoked the trade deficit and said, \"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" adding that that the administration is committed to using \"every lever of executive power to address this crisis.\"",

      "Since Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 50 countries in April, his administration has faced half a dozen lawsuits challenging the president's ability to impose tariffs without the approval of Congress.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James called the decision a \"major victory for our efforts to uphold the law and protect New Yorkers from illegal policies that threaten American jobs and economy.\"",
      "\"The law is clear: no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes whenever they like. These tariffs are a massive tax hike on working families and American businesses that would have led to more inflation, economic damage to businesses of all sizes, and job losses across the country if allowed to continue,\" James' statement continued.",
      "Lawyers for the small businesses alleged that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- which Trump invoked to impose the tariffs -- does not give the president the right to issue \"across-the-board worldwide tariffs,\" and that Trump's justification for the tariffs was invalid.",
      "\"His claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination,\" the lawsuit said. \"Trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency.\"",
      "During a hearing earlier this month, a group of three judges -- who were appointed by presidents Obama, Trump and Reagan -- pushed a lawyer for the small businesses to provide a legal basis to override the tariffs. While a different court in the 1970s determined that the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- the law that preceded the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- gave the president the right to impose tariffs, no court has weighed whether the president can impose tariffs unilaterally under the IEEPA.",
      "During a May 13 hearing, Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer from the conservative Liberty Justice Center representing the plaintiffs, argued that Trump's purported emergency to justify the tariffs is far short of what is required under the law.",
      "\"I'm asking this court to be an umpire and call a strike; you're asking me, well, where's the strike zone? Is it at the knees or slightly below the knees?\" Schwab argued. \"I'm saying it's a wild pitch and it's on the other side of the batter and hits the backstop, so we don't need to debate that.\"",
      "The ruling marks the first time a federal court has issued a ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs. In May, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, but opted to transfer the case to the Court of International Trade.",

      "As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals and to fulfill the president\u2019s vow to be a global peacemaker.",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East and go-to mediator Steve Witkoff made a surprise announcement at the White House on Wednesday, declaring he believed that a temporary truce in Gaza was now within reach -- and that it could lead to \u201ca peaceful resolution of that conflict.\u201d",
      "\"I think that we are on the precipice of sending out a new term sheet, that hopefully will be delivered later on today. The president is going to review it, and I have some very good feelings about getting to a long-term resolution,\u201d Witkoff said.",
      "U.S. officials said they expected the framework would be transmitted to Israel and to Hamas via mediators late Wednesday or early Thursday, and that the reason for Witkoff\u2019s optimism was that the administration believes the terms of the new proposal for ensuring talks continue after the initial hostage release and 60-day long ceasefire would appeal to both parties.",
      "Any break in the warfare would also present the opportunity to scale up a newly launched, U.S.-backed effort to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza, which came under fire this week after multiple videos showing widespread chaos at distribution sites emerged.",
      "Negotiations still may face an uphill battle, particularly with Hamas.",
      "The initial three-day peace deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was brokered by members of both the Biden and Trump administrations, collapsed in March after Israel sought to extend the initial stage of the agreement to rescue more detainees from Gaza without proceeding to more in-depth negotiations aimed at ultimately reaching a two-state solution. At the time of deal\u2019s collapse, the Trump administration supported Israel\u2019s proposed extension.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs.",
      "The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, rattled financial markets and raised the risk of higher prices and recession in the United States and around the world.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over civil cases involving trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "The court\u2019s decision blocks the tariffs Trump slapped last month on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "On April 2, Trump imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else. He later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to agree to reduce barriers to U.S. exports. But he kept the baseline tariffs in place. Claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, he justified the taxes under IEEPA by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.",
      "The tariffs are being challenged in at least seven lawsuits. In the ruling Wednesday, the trade court combined two of the cases \u2014 one brought by five small businesses and another by 12 U.S. states.",
      "The ruling does leave in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But those levies were invoked under a different law that required a Commerce Department investigation and could not be imposed at the president\u2019s own discretion.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic and financial crisis that arose when the United States suddenly devalued the dollar by ending a policy that linked the U.S. currency to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEPPA.",
      "The court disagreed, deciding that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs exceeded his authority to regulate imports under IEEPA. It also said the tariffs did nothing to deal with problems they were supposed to address. In their case, the states noted that America's trade deficits hardly amount of a sudden emergency. The United States has racked them up for 49 straight years in good times and bad.",
      "Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says the court's decision \"throws the president\u2019s trade policy into turmoil.\u201d",
      "\u201cPartners negotiating hard during the 90-day day tariff pause period may be tempted to hold off making further concessions to the U.S. until there is more legal clarity,\" she said.",
      "Likewise, companies will have to reassess the way they run their supply chains, perhaps speeding up shipments to the United States to offset the risk that the tariffs will be reinstated on appeal.",
      "The trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and only for 150 days with countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.",
      "For now, the trade court's ruling \u201cdestroys the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for using federal emergency powers to impose tariffs, which oversteps congressional authority and contravenes any notion of due process,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"The ruling makes it clear that the broad tariffs imposed unilaterally by Trump represent an overreach of executive power.''",

      "South Carolina Democrat Dr. Annie Andrews says she\u2019s running against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Dr. Annie Andrews, the South Carolina Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Nancy Mace in 2022, says she's running against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026, challenging the four-term incumbent in part due to what she characterized as his waffling positions over the course of his political career.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s changed his position on nearly every issue over that time and that\u2019s because, in my view, he doesn\u2019t stand for anything or believe in anything other than what it takes to get reelected,\u201d Andrews, a pediatrician in Charleston, told The Associated Press before a campaign rollout Thursday.",
      "Andrews joins at least one other Democrat in a primary field.",
      "In her launch video, Andrews says it\u2019s \u201cembarrassing\u201d to see how politicians like Graham \u2014 at the moment one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top Senate allies \u2014 have swung from criticizing Trump to working to gain his favor. The video features archival video of Graham bemoaning critics who called Trump a \u201ckook\u201d and then, a year earlier, using the same term to describe his former GOP primary foe in the 2016 presidential contest.",
      "Andrews also levies criticism at Graham for voting to confirm Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and for his relationship with Elon Musk, describing \u201can unelected billionaire ... taking a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare and veterans\u2019 healthcare.\u201d She calls Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u201ca guy who can\u2019t even organize a text thread,\u201d a reference to the recent Signal chat scandal in which war plans were discussed.",
      "No Democrat has won a U.S. Senate seat in South Carolina in decades, and Republicans in recent history typically take statewide seats by double-digit margins. When he last ran in 2020, Graham defeated his Democratic opponent, Jaime Harrison, by a 10 percentage point margin.",
      "That contest turned into South Carolina\u2019s most expensive ever, with both candidates posting record fundraising that surpassed $200 million total and continued to grow in the race\u2019s closing days. Harrison, who went on to chair the Democratic National Committee, became the first U.S. Senate candidate to amass a war chest of more than $100 million over the course of the race.",
      "Andrews was the Democratic nominee who unsuccessfully sought to unseat Mace in 2022, losing to the Republican by 14 percentage points. South Carolina's 1st District, which spans the state's southern coast, is the only one to have flipped from red to blue in decades, when Joe Cunningham won it for Democrats for a single term in the 2018 election. Mace won it in 2020 and has been reelected twice, although in 2026 she is eyeing a race for governor.",
      "In the years since her House run, Andrews stepped away from her practice at the Medical University of South Carolina and founded a political organization focused on issues related to children, including climate change, gun violence and childhood poverty. According to federal filings, an affiliated political action committee, Their Future PAC, gave $7,000 to a handful of candidates in the 2024 cycle and had about $5,000 on hand at the end of 2024.",
      "Asked about Democrats' lackluster statewide record in the state, Andrews said she felt Harrison's effort was \u201chamstrung\u201d by necessary precautions in place during the pandemic. Now, she said, voters feel strained under the effects of the Trump administration's \u201cchaotic\u201d policies.",
      "\"Lindsey Graham has had 22 years to make things better for folks here in South Carolina, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many voters who could articulate in what way Lindsey has made their life better,\" Andrews said.",
      "Graham, seeking his fifth Senate term, kicked off his reelection campaign in February, announcing that Gov. Henry McMaster and Sen. Tim Scott would chair his effort. Scott, the state\u2019s junior senator, is serving as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chamber\u2019s campaign arm.",
      "At least one Republican has announced a primary challenge to Graham.",

      "Reps. Mike Flood and Ashley Hinson faced constituents back home Wednesday.",
      "As Elon Musk pans Republicans' major legislative package this week, two House Republicans got an earful from constituents back home on the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., was shouted down and booed in Seward, Nebraska, where hundreds of people attended his town hall.",
      "\"When you start to get 300 to 400 people and the majority of them are unhappy, that should start to send a message,\" attendee Don Hutchinson told KLKN.",
      "Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, also faced a rowdy crowd at a town hall in Decorah, Iowa, as she praised President Donald Trump and the passage of bill in the House.",
      "\"I was also proud to vote for President Trump's one big, beautiful bill last week. This is a generational investment,\" Hinson said -- to loud boos from the crowd.",
      "\"This is your time,\" Hinson told the crowd. \"So I am here to clear up a lot of the misinformation that's out there because this bill is about securing our borders. This bill is about providing continued tax relief for working Americans and returning our country to prosperity.",
      "\"So simply put, anyone who voted no on this bill also voted to allow your taxes to go up,\" she added.",
      "The crowd jeered and shouted, \"No!\"",
      "\"I don't know why you'd boo tax relief for you,\" Hinson told the crowd. \"I think it's really important that you get to keep more of your own money. So, my philosophy is and always has been it is your money. It's not the government's money.\"",
      "Flood was criticized over the Medicaid provisions in the bill, which was passed by the House last week but could still be altered by the Senate.",
      "The Medicaid changes in the bill would translate to $700 billion in reduced spending through new eligibility and work requirements that could force millions of people off the program, according to preliminary analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Hinson was also pressed by a constituent who had a disability on whether she could lose coverage under the bill.",
      "\"OK, so you're disabled. Anyone who is medically frail is explicitly exempted in our legislation,\" Hinson responded. \"That is, that is you. Caretakers of those who are disabled, they are also exempted from that work requirement.\"",
      "Flood and Hinson did admit there were provisions in the bill that they did not fully support, and Flood was booed when he said he was not aware that the bill contained language that would make it harder for judges to hold parties in contempt of court.",
      "Democrats say the language could protect Trump administration officials from fallout if they defy court orders.",
      "\"I am not going to hide the truth,\" Flood said. \"This provision was unknown to me when I voted for that bill, and when I found out that provision was in the bill, I immediately reached out to my Senate counterparts and told them of my concern.\"",
      "Hinson also revealed her dissatisfaction with some components of the bill, including the state and local tax deduction cap, or SALT, increase.",
      "Flood also said he does not believe the Trump administration can suspend habeas corpus when he was pressed on not doing enough to check the actions of the White House.",
      "\"Grow a spine and speak up!\" one attendee shouted.",
      "The crowd in Iowa grew raucous when cuts from Musk's Department of Government Efficiency came up. However, Hinson said she has \"received overwhelmingly positive feedback\" on DOGE's work.",
      "\"My entire philosophy is the intent behind those is that we absolutely have to cut waste, fraud and abuse so that we can sustain key programs and investments that Iowans and Americans care about,\" Hinson said despite being drowned out by the audience.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic and Republican candidates for New Jersey's primary for governor are offering a glimpse of where the general election campaign could go",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- In the waning days of New Jersey's contested primary for governor, Democratic and Republican candidates are offering a glimpse of where the general election campaign could go. They're grappling over the package of Trump tax breaks and program cuts recently passed by the House but characterizing it in dramatically different ways.",
      "Each side is using the measure as a cudgel against the other.",
      "Depending on which party\u2019s candidates are speaking, Trump is either a tax-cutting hero who is cleaning up the nation\u2019s broken immigration system and right-sizing the federal government, or a rogue president recklessly rounding up U.S. citizens, driving up federal debt and slashing benefits for older and sicker Americans without regard for the law or who gets hurt.",
      "That stark contrast in the two respective primaries suggests New Jersey voters will have clear decisions to make in the November general election \u2014 and that their choices, even in a state long dominated by Democrats, could signal how President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive second term is playing nationwide.",
      "The wrangling in New Jersey comes before the June 10 primary in one of just two governors' contests this year. The other is in Virginia. Both are being looked at for signs of how Democrats will answer Trump's 2024 victory and his agenda and, for Republicans, as a fresh test of the president's popularity.",
      "The legislation Republicans call a \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d is front and center in the argument.",
      "In sparring over social media, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill opposed the bill, while Republican Jack Ciattarelli talked up the benefits of its tax cuts. The two are widely seen as leading contenders for their parties' nominations.",
      "Sherrill said the bill would drive up costs and attempted to link Ciattarelli, a former state legislator, to health care and food assistance cuts. \u201cYou are a yes-man for the MAGA agenda,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Ciattarelli jabbed Sherrill over opposing what would amount to tax cuts for many residents.",
      "The tax cuts in the bill working its way through Congress are needed in New Jersey, he wrote, \u201cthanks to Democrats making NJ the highest taxed state in America.\u201d",
      "The sniping could persist to the general election, experts say. Democrats are eager to blame the president and his party for unpopular cuts to social safety net programs and the GOP is looking to pin economic difficulties on Democrats, who've been in charge of state government for eight years.",
      "Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is term-limited after winning twice. In a climate where voters can be restless for change, some say it's a matter of what they will decide to be against.",
      "\u201cThe real question will be do they hate Phil Murphy more or Donald Trump more?\u201d said Julie Roginsky, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist, \u201cAre they looking to turn the page on Phil Murphy or Donald Trump?\u201d",
      "Along with Sherrill, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City, former Senate President Steve Sweeney and teacher's union executive Sean Spiller are locked in what appears to be a competitive contest for the Democratic nomination. Sherill has the backing of several influential county parties.",
      "But the contest is unfolding in a new era, after the downfall of the county party line, a unique-to-New Jersey practice in which local parties were able to give their preferred candidates favorable ballot placement. And with each of the Democratic candidates marshaling support from different parts of the party base, it can be hard to tell who's in the lead.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking at the polls with a little more skepticism simply because how the landscape has changed,\u201d said Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison.",
      "A common thread among Democrats has been scalding criticism of the president and Republicans in Washington. Baraka made national headlines when he was arrested on a federal trespassing charge that was later dropped when he went to inspect an immigration detention center in Newark. Sherrill, Gottheimer and Spiller went to the site of the arrest later in a show of support and to demonstrate their opposition to the president's immigration crackdown.",
      "On the GOP side, the race changed significantly after Trump endorsed Ciattarelli, giving his seal of approval to the small business owner and former state lawmaker who once called the president a \u201ccharlatan.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli has more recently embraced the president, whose endorsement is widely seen as a knockout blow in the GOP primary. Other Republicans in the contest have not, for the most part, disavowed the president, whose influence is hard to miss in the candidates' rhetoric.",
      "Former 101.5 talk radio host Bill Spadea has talked about replicating the Department of Government Efficiency in New Jersey. Former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac casts himself as a long-time, true Trump loyalist.",
      "State Sen. Jon Bramnick is alone in criticizing the president, particularly his pardons of those convicted in the Jan. 6 , 2021, Capitol insurrection, but even he has supported Trump's push to end so-called sanctuary policies. Justin Barbera, a contractor from Burlington County, will also be on the ballot for Republicans.",
      "New Jersey has been reliably Democratic in presidential and Senate contests for decades, but Republicans do better in governors' contests, with each of the last three GOP governors winning two terms.",
      "Democrats have struggled to find a message since Trump's victory last year, with the winner of the New Jersey primary poised to attract a national spotlight as the party seeks to build on special election victories, even among GOP voters. Republicans hope Democrats' eight years of state government control will result in voters taking any frustrations they feel out against the party in power in Trenton rather than on Trump.",
      "New Jersey has seen its Democratic voter registration dip from about 1 million more than Republicans to roughly 800,000 more. Unaffiliated voters \u2014 those without a party, sometimes called independents\u2014 rival the Democrats' advantage.",
      "Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, suggested Democrats can't be complacent.",
      "\u201cOne of the things we have to remember is there\u2019s something about the office of governor,\u201d he said. \"Voters are looking for something beyond ideology when it comes to our governors. They want executive administration skills \u2014 and sometimes they are willing to vote for Republicans.\"",

    "story": [
      "The prosecution is resting in the second trial of Karen Read after attorneys for the state of Massachusetts took a more streamlined approach to try to prove Read\u2019s guilt in the killing of her Boston police officer boyfriend",
      "The prosecution in the second trial of Karen Read rested Thursday after about a month of testimony spotlighting evidence from the scene and witnesses who heard the defendant repeatedly say \u201cI hit him\u201d in reference to the killing of her Boston police officer boyfriend.",
      "Read, 45, is accused of backing her SUV into her boyfriend, John O\u2019Keefe, and leaving the 46-year-old officer to die on a snowy night in the front yard of another officer\u2019s home after she dropped him off at a party there in January 2022. Her lawyers say she was framed in a police conspiracy and someone in the home that night killed him.",
      "A mistrial was declared last year and the second trial has attracted massive media attention and become the subject of a Hulu documentary series. Read\u2019s second trial on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene has often looked similar to the first trial. If she is found guilty of the most serious charge of second-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life in prison.",
      "The prosecution, led this time by Hank Brennan, has taken a more streamlined, focused approach.",
      "Unlike the first trial where witness after witness undermined the prosecution's case, Brennan did everything to avoid those mistakes. Most significantly, he refrained from putting Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in the case, on the stand.",
      "Proctor was fired in March after a disciplinary board found he sent sexist and crude text messages about Read to his family and colleagues. His testimony played a key role in the first trial. Defense attorneys used his text messages to attempt to show Proctor was biased and ignored the possibility of other suspects.",
      "Brennan also didn't put Brian Albert, the Boston officer who owned the house where O'Keefe's body was found, on the stand. He also passed on putting on Brian Higgins, a federal agent who had exchanged flirty texts with Read, on the stand.",
      "All three testified in the first trial and could be called by the defense as it seeks to show O'Keefe was beaten at the house party hosted by Albert and left outside to die.",
      "Read\u2019s attorney, Alan Jackson, still managed to raise concerns about Higgins and Proctor.",
      "During the cross-examination of Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Yuriy Bukhenik, he made him read all the flirtatious texts between Higgins and Read.",
      "Jackson also brought up a text message chain with Bukhenik in which Proctor said, \u201cI hate that man, I truly hate him\u201d about David Yannetti, an attorney for Read.",
      "Broken pieces of Read's taillight. A broken cocktail glass. Read's words the scene.",
      "Prosecutors have spent much of the trial building their case through evidence from the scene. Like before, they started by introducing several law enforcement witnesses who were among the first responders and recalled hearing Read repeatedly say \u201cI hit him\u201d after she found O'Keefe.",
      "They also played several clips of interviews Read has done since the first trial, in which she talked about how much she drank and made comments suggesting she knew what she did. She also talked about pulling a piece of glass from O'Keefe's nose.",
      "\u201cCould I have clipped him? Could I have tapped him in the knee and incapacitated him?\u201d she said during an interview for a documentary on the case. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look mortally wounded, as far as I could see\u201d but \u201ccould I have done something that knocked him out and in his drunkenness and in the cold didn\u2019t come to again.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors called a neurosurgeon who testified O\u2019Keefe suffered a \u201cclassic blunt trauma injury\u201d associated with falling backward and hitting the back of his head.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors pieces of the Read's broken taillight, which they say was damaged when she hit O'Keefe. The defense argues the taillight was damaged later when she was backing out of O'Keefe's house and hit O'Keefe's car.",
      "Prosecutors also introduced evidence of a broken cocktail glass, found at the scene, which they said O'Keefe was holding when Read backed into him.",
      "Andre Porto, a forensic scientist who works in the DNA unit of the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, detailed various items he tested, including the broken rear taillight and pieces of a broken cocktail glass found in in the yard. Only O'Keefe was a likely match for both.",
      "Porto found three DNA contributors but only O\u2019Keefe was a likely match. He also tested DNA from parts of a broken cocktail glass found in the yard and only O\u2019Keefe was seen as a likely match. Porto also tested a hair found on the taillight.",
      "Later in the trial, analyst Karl Miyasako of Bode Technology testified that tests of the hair sample taken from Read\u2019s vehicle found a mitochondrial DNA match to O\u2019Keefe. He said that means the DNA could be a match to O\u2019Keefe or any one of his maternal relatives.",
      "The trial could easily continue several more weeks as Read's defense team makes its case. Read has said the defense's case will be \u201cmore robust\u201d this time. It listed over 90 witnesses who could testify.",
      "\u201cI'm anxious for everyone to learn what we know,\u201d she said last week.",
      "Read's defense has vigorously questioned the prosecution's witnesses and called into question evidence presented about O'Keefe's death. During opening statements in April, Brennan said Read \u201cadmitted what she did that night\u201d and pointed to a television interview in which Read said \u201ccould I have clipped him?\u201d about O'Keefe's death.",

      "He's due to decide by end of court Thursday whether to testify. If he does, it would be a remarkable twist \u2014 and potentially risky legal move \u2014 in the yearslong saga of the onetime Hollywood honcho-turned-#MeToo outcast.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on rape and sexual assault charges because New York's highest court overturned his 2020 conviction. He denies the allegations, and his attorneys maintain that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify at his original trial. Many defendants in criminal cases don't.",
      "The U.S. Constitution guarantees that they don't have to. Jurors are told that they can't hold such silence against defendants and that it's up to prosecutors to prove their case; defendants do not need to prove anything. If defendants do take the stand, they open themselves to pointed questioning from prosecutors.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers began calling witnesses late Wednesday, starting with a physician-pharmacist discussing a medication that had come up in testimony.",
      "In the weeks prior, the defense asked plenty of questions aimed at raising doubts about the credibility and accuracy of what jurors were hearing from prosecution witnesses, particularly Weinstein's three accusers in the case.",
      "Two of the women allege that he forcibly performed oral sex on them, separately, in 2006. The third says he raped her in 2013.",

      "The missing family from Troy, Texas, includes Mary Maynard, 37, and David Maynard, 42, along with sons Colton, 11, and Brantley, 8, according to the statement.",
      "The search for the family was launched in August after a report came in that a 28-foot (8.5-meter) aluminum boat carrying eight people had begun taking on water, the U.S. Coast Guard said at the time. The Coast Guard notified other ships in the area of the situation, and a boat nearby rescued four people.",
      "The Coast Guard scoured Kachemak Bay and Alaska search and rescue crews tried to use sonar equipment to find the family, according to the state's public safety department. But they were not successful and by the next evening, the search was suspended.",
      "Christi Wells, who provided a statement on behalf of Mary Maynard\u2019s parents at the time, said the family enjoyed spending time with friends and relatives, and traveling, according to the Anchorage Daily News. Mary Maynard was a traveling nurse and David Maynard stayed at home with the children and had a lawn care business, she said.",

      "Harvard University is holding it commencement Thursday",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University is holding its commencement Thursday at a pivotal moment, when its place as one of the world's leading higher education institutions is under what increasingly seems like existential threats from the Trump administration.",
      "Other schools face the loss of federal funding and their ability to enroll international students if they don't agree to the Trump administration's shifting demands. But Harvard, which was founded in 1636, a century and a half before the nation itself, is taking the lead on defying the White House in federal court \u2014 and paying a significant price.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s latest salvos include asking federal agencies to cancel about $100 million in contracts with the Ivy League school. The government already canceled more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants, moved to cut off Harvard\u2019s enrollment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status.",
      "Visa interviews for international students admitted to schools nationwide were halted on Tuesday, and Trump said Wednesday that Harvard should reduce its international enrollment from 25% to about 15%.",
      "Sustained by a $53 billion endowment, the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university is testing whether it can be a bulwark against Trump\u2019s efforts to limit what it calls antisemitic activism on campus, which Harvard sees as an affront to the freedom to teach and learn nationwide.",
      "The Trump administration has demanded Harvard enact broad government and leadership reforms and changes to its admissions policies. It also demanded the university audit views of diversity on campus and stop recognizing some student clubs.",
      "Dr. Abraham Verghese, the bestselling author and Stanford expert on infectious diseases, will be the principal speaker at the university's 374th commencement. On Wednesday, NBA Hall of Famer and activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the \u201cClass Day\u201d speaker, and journalist Christiane Amanpour addressed graduates of Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "Both praised Harvard for standing up to the Trump administration, with Abdul-Jabbar specifically calling out the actions of Harvard President Alan Garber.",
      "\u201cWhen a tyrannical administration tried to bully and threaten Harvard, to revoke their academic freedom and to destroy free speech, Dr. Alan Garber rejected the illegal and immoral pressures,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said to wide applause as he compared Garber's response to Rosa Parks' stand against racist segregation.",
      "\u201cAfter seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,\" he continued.",
      "In response to the administration's threats, Harvard has sued to block the funding freeze and persuaded a federal judge to temporarily halt the enrollment ban. It is going to court in Boston on Thursday just as the commencement is wrapping up, hoping for a ruling that allows it to continue enrolling international students.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the government overreach and devastating attacks on scientific and medical research are unwarranted and unlawful, and so we have taken legal action to defend the institution,\u201d Garber said in an interview with a university publication.",
      "\u201cWe should all be concerned that colleges and universities have increasingly come under attack. But we should not dismiss the criticisms even when they are based on distortions or inaccuracies \u2014 we need to look for the underlying concerns that can be embedded in them,\u201d said Garber, who commissioned internal reports last year on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the Ivy League campus.",
      "The Trump administration has said it wants \"to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\u201d It cites campus protests against Israel. Like many college students around the country, Harvard students set up tents called on the university to divest from companies supporting Israel's military, which has leveled Gaza in response to attacks by Hamas.",
      "Last year, hundreds of graduating students walked out of commencement chanting \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d after weeks of campus protests. Harvard also said some protesters would not receive diplomas alongside their classmates, although it eventually allowed most to get them.",
      "This year, the anti-war demonstrations have largely faded from view, but protesters plan a silent vigil before Thursday's ceremony.",
      "\u201cAs a graduate of Harvard, I am horrified by Israel\u2019s mass murder of Palestinians (including by deliberate starvation), its total leveling of Gaza, its targeting of hospitals, its assaults on Palestinian educational and cultural institutions, and its relentless killings of journalists,\" Harvard graduate Victor Wallis explained in a statement.",

      "\u201cI want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building \u2014 as a man, as a father, and as an artist,\" NBA YoungBoy, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden, said in a statement posted online.",
      "Gaulden\u2019s pardon was confirmed Wednesday evening by two White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to detail actions that had not yet been formally made public.",
      "In 2024, Gaulden was sentenced by a federal judge in Utah after he acknowledged possessing weapons despite being a convicted felon. He reached an agreement that resolved Utah state charges against him and settled two sets of federal charges against him \u2014 one carried a 23-month sentence and the other ordered five years of probation and a $200,000 fine.",
      "Gaulden was released from federal prison in March and sent to home confinement after receiving credit for time served, according to his attorney Drew Findling. With home confinement finished last month, the pardon means he won't have to follow the terms of his probation, including drug testing, he said.",
      "Findling said he was thrilled Gaulden's legal saga had reached an end.",
      "\u201cFrom Louisiana to Utah the battles have been endless, and now he can concentrate on first and foremost his family, and then, of course, his amazing career,\u201d Findling said in a statement.",
      "The rapper has acknowledged that he possessed a Glock 21 .45-caliber pistol and a Masterpiece Arms MPA30T 9mm handgun while filming a rap video in Baton Rouge. He has also said he had a Sig Sauer 9mm semi-automatic pistol at his home in Huntsville, Utah. He had agreed to give up the guns.",
      "Gaulden had previously been convicted in Louisiana of aggravated assault with a firearm, according to his statement released in advance of the plea agreement.",
      "He had also pleaded guilty in November to his role in a prescription drug fraud ring that operated out of his home in Utah. He had to pay a $25,000 fine and was given no prison time.",
      "The rapper, whose stage moniker stands for \u201cNever Broke Again,\u201d is preparing to set out on a major U.S. tour in September.",
      "He has achieved four No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 and one Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. His music includes \u201c38 Baby,\u201d \u201cOutside Today\u201d and Tyler, The Creator\u2019s song, \u201cWusyaname,\u201d on which he is featured with Ty Dolla $ign. That collaboration earned them a Grammy nomination in 2022 for Best Melodic Rap Performance.",

      "\u201cNo one would say that they are happy about any aspect of this case, it was a tragedy all the way around, but today's resolution will bring closure to the case,\u201d Olsen's lawyers Amanda Clark Palmer and Don Samuel said in a statement. \u201cWe are relieved that our client will not serve any additional time in custody.\u201d",

      "Olsen was responding to a call of a naked man behaving erratically at an Atlanta-area apartment complex in March 2015 when he killed 26-year-old Hill, a Black Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Olsen, who was a DeKalb County police officer at the time, said he was acting in self-defense.",
      "He was indicted in January 2016 on charges including murder, aggravated assault, violation of his oath of office and making a false statement.",
      "A jury in 2019 found him guilty of one count of aggravated assault, two counts of violating his oath of office and one count of making a false statement. He was sentenced to serve 12 years in prison, followed by eight years of probation. He appealed his conviction of aggravated assault and one count of violation of his oath, and the Georgia Court of Appeals last year overturned those convictions.",
      "Before trial, Olsen's lawyers had argued that the DeKalb County Police Department\u2019s use of force policy should not be submitted as evidence. The appeals court agreed that the trial court was wrong to admit the policy into evidence without identifying and redacting the portions that conflict with Georgia law.",
      "The appeals court ruling said that prosecutors could retry Olsen on the aggravated assault charge but not the violation of oath count.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans jail that gained national attention for a brazen escape by 10 inmates earlier this month is experiencing \u201csignificant flooding\u201d from \u201congoing and severe plumbing failures,\u201d the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office says.",

      "State and local officials have generally disputed Hutson\u2019s characterization of the $150 million state-of-the-art facility built in 2015 and blamed the sheriff\u2019s leadership since taking office in 2022. The jail system has been under the oversight of a federal judge and the U.S. Justice Department since 2013.",
      "\u201cThese recurring plumbing issues highlight a much deeper infrastructure crisis at OJC, rooted in years of deferred maintenance, chronic overcrowding, and a lack of meaningful investment,\u201d Hutson said in statement Wednesday. \u201cThis is not just a facilities problem. It\u2019s a public safety issue, a staffing issue, and most of all, a human dignity issue.\u201d",
      "The sheriff's office renewed calls this week for \u201cimmediate and sustained infrastructure investment,\u201d saying jail flooding and other issues were both \u201cforeseeable and preventable.\u201d It said it requires at least $13 million in urgent fixes and that requests for help have been made repeatedly to city officials.",
      "But New Orleans City Council members questioned management of the jail last week during a tense meeting and argued the sheriff's office requires greater transparency and accountability. The city's chief administrative officer also noted the department has received a larger proportionate increase in funding since 2019 than any other public safety agency in the city.",
      "The longstanding debate over how to improve the city's jail system persists as two inmates remain at large. The group of fugitives escaped in the early hours of May 16 by yanking open a jail door, removing a toilet and crawling through a hole in the wall where steel bars had been cut away, then hopping over barbed-wire fencing using blankets.",
      "Authorities say the inmates were able to escape because a maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, turned off the water in the cell after an inmate allegedly threatened to shank him.",
      "Williams' lawyer Michael Kennedy has said the plumber was not threatened and had only turned off the water after being told to do so by a deputy. Williams was unaware that the inmates intentionally clogged the toilet as part of an orchestrated plan to escape, Kennedy said. Authorities have made no mention of the cell having a clogged toilet.",
      "Over the weekend \u2014 in a seemingly unrelated incident \u2014 the jail received \u201cemergency repairs\u201d as water pooled and the facility remains forced to rely on an \u201cexternal water supply\" as of Wednesday, the sheriff's office said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has pardoned former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned from Congress after a tax fraud conviction.",
      "The pardon was disclosed Wednesday by a White House official who requested anonymity before an official announcement.",
      "Grimm, a former Marine and FBI agent, pleaded guilty in late 2014 to underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant he ran in Manhattan. He resigned from Congress the following year and served eight months in prison. Grimm tried to reenter politics in 2018 but lost a primary for his old district.",
      "While he was in Congress, Grimm made headlines for threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony in the Capitol after the reporter asked about the long-running FBI investigation into his campaign finances.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I\u2019ll throw you off this (expletive) balcony,\u201d he told the reporter during the exchange, which was captured on video.",
      "When the reporter pushed back, telling the then-congressman that it was a valid question, Grimm responded, \u201cNo. No. You\u2019re not man enough. You\u2019re not man enough. I\u2019ll break you in half. Like a boy.\u201d",
      "After heavy criticism, Grimm said he was wrong for threatening the reporter and that \u201cit shouldn't have happened.\u201d",
      "The former congressman worked at the conservative news outlet Newsmax.",
      "Last year, Grimm was paralyzed from the chest down after being thrown from a horse during a polo tournament.",
      "In a short video posted on Grimm\u2019s Facebook in January, the former congressman said, \u201clittle by little, I\u2019m getting better,\u201d and said he was working on getting more dexterity in his fingers and getting his legs to move. In March, a GoFundMe page that was set up for Grimm posted that he had been able to \u201cwithstand 4 minutes upright assisted on the tilt-table,\u201d along with a picture of Grimm smiling.",
      "Grimm did not return messages seeking comment on Wednesday.",

      "The South Carolina Supreme Court has rejected a request from an inmate set to die next month for more information on the firing squad after concerns about the last execution by bullets in April",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a request for more information on the firing squad from an inmate set to die next month over concerns about whether a man executed by the method last month suffered a lingering death.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that attorneys for Stephen Stanko did not prove the previous execution was botched even though lawyers argued the firing squad nearly missed the inmate's heart and prolonged his death. They also said all three bulleted fired may not have hit the prisoner's body.",
      "Stanko, 57, is scheduled to die June 13. He has been sentenced to death twice in the state for two separate murders \u2014 one a friend and one his girlfriend as he raped her daughter.",
      "Stanko has until Friday to decide if he wants to die by firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair.",
      "Stanko's execution is the first scheduled in South Carolina since Mikal Mahdi was put to death by firing squad on April 11.",
      "Mahdi\u2019s lawyers released autopsy results that show the shots that killed him barely hit his heart and suggested he was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly.",
      "Stanko\u2019s lawyers asked the South Carolina Supreme Court to require prison officials to release more information about the firing squad and lethal injection, saying he was leaning toward the firing squad until the possible problems with Mahdi\u2019s execution surfaced.",
      "Mahdi was the second inmate to die in South Carolina by firing squad.",
      "The only photo of Mahdi taken at his autopsy shows two apparent chest wounds. Officials said all three bullets fired by the three volunteer prison employees hit Mahdi, with two going through the same hole.",
      "During the state\u2019s first firing squad death, the autopsy found that Brad Sigmon\u2019s heart had been destroyed. Just one of the four chambers of Mahdi\u2019s heart was perforated, which likely meant he didn\u2019t die in the 15 seconds experts predicted he would have if the squad\u2019s aim was true, according to his lawyers.",
      "Witnesses said Mahdi, who had a hood over his head, groaned 45 seconds after he was shot.",
      "Lawyers for Stanko said Mahdi's autopsy lacked X-rays, an examination of his clothing or other testing typically done to allow the results \u2014 like where a bullet tracked \u2014 to be independently verified.",
      "But the state Supreme Court rejected the request for any reports the prison agency produces to review executions, the description of the training the firing squad conducts and the steps taken when an X-ray is done before the shooting to locate the heart.",
      "The justices also refused to require prison officials to say if the same members of the firing squad and target placement team used for Mahdi would work on Stanko's execution.",
      "\"Appellant has made no showing that Mahdi\u2019s execution was 'botched' or that protocols were not followed such that Appellant needs further information to make an informed election of the method of his execution,\" the justices wrote.",
      "Stanko is being executed for killing his 74-year-old friend Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying and then shot Turner twice while using a pillow as a silencer, authorities said.",
      "Stanko stole Turner\u2019s truck, cleaned out his bank account and then spent the next few days in Augusta, Georgia, where he told people in town for the Masters golf tournament that he owned several Hooters restaurants. He stayed with a woman who took him to church. She then called police once she saw his photo and that he was wanted, police said.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials.",
      "\u201cStephen Stanko is just plain evil. He has in his core down deep inside something that makes him evil. He\u2019s a bad man, he knows it, and he likes it. He doesn\u2019t turn away from it. He will hide it. He\u2019s very, very, very good at hiding it, but you cannot equate evil with insanity,\u201d then-prosecutor Greg Hembree said in his closing statement at one of Stanko\u2019s trials.",
      "Hembree later became a state senator and was the chief sponsor of the 2021 law allowing South Carolina to use a firing squad.",

      "California is opening up its track-and-field championship to more girls after a transgender athlete drew controversy for qualifying for the meet",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California is opening up its track-and-field championship to more girls after a transgender athlete drew controversy for qualifying for the meet.",
      "The California Interscholastic Federation announced the temporary rule change Tuesday after high school junior AB Hernandez's success drew backlash, including from President Donald Trump. He criticized the athlete's participation in a social media post Tuesday, though the group said it decided on the rule change before that.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Former California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law in 2013 allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity.",
      "A Republican-led effort to block that law failed recently in the Democratic-dominated Legislature. Another proposal that also failed would have required the federation to ban students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team.",
      "The federation said it was launching a \u201cpilot entry process\u201d to allow more girls participate in the championship track-and-field meet.",
      "Under the change, \u201cany biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their Section\u2019s automatic qualifying entries in the CIF State meet, and did not achieve the CIF State at-large mark in the finals at their Section meet\u201d could compete, the group said.",
      "If a transgender athlete medals, their ranking would not displace a \u201cbiological female\u201d student from medaling, the federation confirmed. In high jump, triple jump and long jump \u2014 all of the state championship events Hernandez qualified to compete in \u2014 a \u201cbiological female\u201d who would have earned podium placement will get the medal for that place and will be reflected in the records, the federal said.",
      "The federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\" or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.",
      "Experts from organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females.",
      "Hernandez, a trans athlete in Southern California, is at the center of the debate. She won the long jump and triple jump during the division finals and is expected to perform well this weekend. She also set a triple jump meet record at the Ontario Relays earlier this year.",
      "Critics have accused her of having an unfair advantage over other athletes.",
      "Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn't worry about the actions of critics, who have called out her participation and heckled her at postseason meets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.",
      "She noted that she has lost some of her events, saying that disproved arguments that she can't be beat.",
      "The rule change may discriminate against transgender athletes, said Elana Redfield, a policy director at the UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, which researches sexual orientation and gender identity policies.",
      "\u201cThe CIF policy creates two sets of rules \u2014 one for transgender girls, who must earn a place through traditional measures of competition, and another for \u2018biological females,\u2019 some of whom are allowed an extra chance to earn a spot,\u201d Redfield said in an email.",
      "The change seems to \u201cthread a fine needle\u201d by trying to ensure cisgender girls aren't denied a competition slot while still allowing trans athletes to participate, Redfield said.",
      "Doriane Lambelet Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School, said the change would help ensure that \u201cno female athlete loses a place on a team or in a competition when a trans girl is included.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnlike inclusion policies that ignore sex differences, doing it this way doesn\u2019t gaslight the other girls about their biology,\u201d said Coleman, who has researches subjects including children, sports and law and wrote recently on the evolving definition of sex.",
      "Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, called the rule change \u201ca reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness\u201d and said the governor thought it was a thoughtful approach. Newsom angered some liberal allies earlier this year when he questioned the fairness of transgender girls participation in girls sports.",

      "Arrests were once a rarity in or near immigration courts, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents last week showed up at courthouses across the country to arrest migrants who appeared for routine court proceedings. The move has rattled immigrant communities already feeling pressure from the Republican administration to leave.",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey vowed Wednesday that his administration will improve transparency and policies within the state\u2019s embattled foster care system.",
      "Morrisey, a Republican, announced the changes after eight listening sessions statewide to identify areas of improvement and a review of critical cases. Morrisey said he heard attendees at one such session in Martinsburg discuss \u201ca broken system.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was difficult to hear many of the issues could have been avoided had the state communicated differently, had the state eliminated some red tape or had the right tools to better equip\u201d Child Protective Services workers, Morrisey said at a news conference at the state Capitol. \u201cYou all know that these issues have been going on for a very, very long time. And unfortunately it\u2019s the kids that suffer. And we can\u2019t tolerate that.",
      "\u201cWest Virginia cannot keep kicking the can down the road as was done in the past. That\u2019s not the model of this administration.\u201d",
      "Largely overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic in a state with the most overdose deaths per capita, West Virginia has the highest rate of children in foster care \u2014 currently more than 6,000 in a state of about 1.8 million.",
      "Morrisey, who took office in January after serving three terms as the state's attorney general, put some of the blame on the administration of his predecessor, two-term Republican Gov. Jim Justice, for often withholding foster care information from the public, including stonewalling Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "After an internal review of six fatalities or near fatalities between 2021 and 2024, Morrisey said the Department of Human Services will implement a new policy mandating that certain information, including the results of investigations, be disclosed in serious child welfare cases.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have to chase people down the hall\u201d in obtaining case information, Morrisey said.",
      "Among the changes, Morrisey said child welfare supervisors will now be required to conduct monthly reviews of their cases, and a new intake process will be implemented for the foster care system, allowing caseworkers to contact individuals involved rather than simply relying on a case referral. He also said improvements have been made to a child welfare dashboard to allow for easier access to data.",
      "\"What I can promise you today is we want to be honest, we want to be transparent and we will be accountable for what happens,\u201d Morrisey said.",

      "The discovery of the emaciated body of a 14-year-old girl in her home in 2023 prompted a state investigation into whether law enforcement and child protective services could have intervened to prevent her death. The girl\u2019s mother and two grandparents were indicted on murder charges last September.",

      "Others are not only off the grid but beneath it, in the hundreds of caves that lead to vast subterranean spaces.",
      "Local, state and federal law enforcement have continued to scour the region around the prison throughout the third day of the search.",
      "\u201cUntil we have credible evidence that he is not in the area, we assume that he\u2019s probably still in the area,\u201d Rand Champion, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Corrections, said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Fugitive Grant Hardin, 56, \u201cknows where the caves are,\u201d said Darla Nix, a cafe owner in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, whose sons grew up around him. Nix, who describes Hardin as a survivor, remembers him as a \u201cvery, very smart\u201d and mostly quiet person.",
      "For the searchers, \"caves have definitely been a source of concern and a point of emphasis,\" said Champion.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the challenges of this area \u2014 there are a lot of places to hide and take shelter, a lot of abandoned sheds, and there are a lot of caves in this area, so that\u2019s been a priority for the search team,\u201d Champion said.",
      "The area around the prison is \"one of the most cave-dense regions of the state,\u201d said Matt Covington, a University of Arkansas geology professor who studies caves.",
      "Hardin, the former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. He was the subject of the TV documentary \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "He escaped Sunday from the North Central Unit \u2014 a medium-security prison also known as the Calico Rock prison \u2014 by wearing an outfit designed to look like a law enforcement uniform, according to Champion. A prison officer opened a secure gate, allowing him to leave the facility. Champion said that someone should have checked Hardin's identity before he was allowed to leave the facility, describing the lack of verification as a \u201clapse\u201d that is being investigated.",
      "It took authorities approximately 30 minutes to notice Hardin had escaped.",
      "Champion said that inmates are evaluated and given a classification when they first enter the prison system to determine where they are housed. There are portions of the Calico Rock facility that are maximum-security.",
      "While incarcerated, Hardin did not have any major disciplinary issues, Champion said.",
      "Authorities have been using canines, drones and helicopters to search for Hardin in the rugged northern Arkansas terrain, Champion said. The sheriffs of several counties across the Arkansas Ozarks had urged residents to lock their homes and vehicles and call 911 if they notice anything suspicious.",
      "In some ways, the terrain is similar to the site of one of the most notorious manhunts in U.S. history.",
      "Bomber Eric Rudolph, described by authorities as a skilled outdoorsman, evaded law officers for years in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. It was a five-year manhunt that finally ended in 2003 with his capture.",
      "Rudolph knew of many cabins in the area owned by out-of-town people, and he also knew of caves in the area, former FBI executive Chris Swecker, who led the agency\u2019s Charlotte, North Carolina, office at the time, said in the FBI's historical account of the case.",
      "\u201cHe was anticipating a great conflict and he had clearly lined up caves and campsites where he could go,\u201d Swecker said.",
      "Rudolph pleaded guilty to federal charges associated with four bombings in Georgia and Alabama.",
      "There are nearly 2,000 documented caves in northern Arkansas, state officials say. Many of them have entrances only a few feet wide that are not obvious to passersby, said Michael Ray Taylor, who has written multiple books on caves, including \u201cHidden Nature: Wild Southern Caves.\u201d",
      "The key is finding the entrance, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cThe entrance may look like a rabbit hole, but if you wriggle through it, suddenly you find enormous passageways,\u201d he said.",
      "It would be quite possible to hide out underground for an extended period, but \u201cyou have to go out for food, and you're more likely to be discovered,\u201d he said.",
      "Hardin had a checkered and brief law enforcement career. He worked at the Fayetteville Police Department from August 1990 to May 1991, but was let go because he didn\u2019t meet the standards of his training period, a department spokesman said.",
      "Hardin worked about six months at the Huntsville Police Department before resigning, but records do not give a reason for his resignation, according to Police Chief Todd Thomas, who joined the department after Hardin worked there.",
      "Hardin later worked at the Eureka Springs Police Department from 1993 to 1996. Former Chief Earl Hyatt said Hardin resigned because Hyatt was going to fire him over incidents that included the use of excessive force.",
      "\u201cHe did not need to be a police officer at all,\u201d Hyatt told television station KNWA.",
      "He continued to have trouble in his brief stint as an officer in Gateway, according to the 450-person town's mayor Cheryl Tillman.",
      "While Hardin was the town's sole officer, \u201cthere was things that I seen that wasn\u2019t good. He was always angry,\u201d said Tillman, who wasn't mayor at the time.",

Appleton, who was Tillman's brother, worked for the Gateway water department when he was shot in the head on Feb. 23, 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton\u2019s body inside a car. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in prison.",

      "Kathleen Wooden Knife, president of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, wrote in the declaration on Tuesday that the emergency is due to \u201cpervasive law and order and public health issues ... creating threats to public safety, the health and welfare of the general public.\u201d",
      "The declaration asked for increased patrol and investigative support from federal agencies, cooperation from the 12 communities on the reservation and coordination between the tribe and federal government.",
      "Law enforcement is stretched thin on many reservations in the U.S., leading some tribes to sue the federal government. In a lawsuit the Oglala Sioux tribe filed against the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. government is obligated by treaty to support law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation.",
      "The Rosebud Indian Reservation has a dozen law enforcement officers for an area that stretches nearly 1 million acres (404,686 hectares) across five counties, said Lewis Good Voice Eagle, chief of staff to Wooden Knife. Low staffing is partially due to 2016 budget cuts, as well as difficulty retaining officers who don't receive the same benefits as they would working elsewhere.",
      "After previous emergency declarations, the reservation received help from the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Interior, though it was not enough to solve the problems, Good Voice Eagle said.",
      "\u201cWith the shortage of law enforcement and the shortage of juris doctorate barred attorneys, it has really created another nightmare on the Rosebud Indian Reservation,\u201d he said.",
      "Crime on South Dakota's nine Native American reservations has been a longstanding issue and the subject of tense relations with former South Dakota governor and current Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The nine tribes in the state banned her from tribal lands last year for saying publicly that tribal leaders were catering to drug cartels on the reservations.",

      "WOODLAND, Calif. -- A Northern California man's 378-year sentence for sexual assault has been overturned by a judge who said there was strong evidence that his adopted daughter made up the accusations to punish him and improve her prospects of remaining in the U.S.",
      "Ajay Dev, 58, was released May 23 after 16 years in prison for 76 convictions of sexual assault on a minor and related charges, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday.",
      "Superior Court Judge Janene Beronio scheduled a hearing for June 13 for Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig to decide whether to retry Dev. Prosecutors could also appeal the ruling. Reisig's office declined to comment on the case.",
      "Dev, an immigrant from Nepal who worked as a water engineer, was visiting the South Asian nation with his wife in 1998 when they decided to adopt 15-year-old Sapna Dev, part of their extended family, and bring her to live with them in Davis, California.",
      "In early 2004, Sapna Dev\u2019s boyfriend broke up with her, and she accused Ajay Dev of causing the breakup, Beronio said in her ruling. Later she told police that Ajay Dev had had sex with her two or three times a week for three or four years until she moved out of his home, the judge said.",
      "Four witnesses who had not been contacted by Dev\u2019s trial lawyers testified at a recent hearing that Sapna Dev had told them that her accusations against him were lies or were motivated by her anger at him, the Chronicle reported.",
      "One of the witnesses said Sapna Dev told him she made the accusations because she \u201cwas determined to return to the United States and needed to use the criminal charges to do that,\u201d Beronio said.",
      "The judge\u2019s decision \u201cdismantles the DA\u2019s case,\" said Patricia Purcell, a member of advocacy group that has held demonstrations in support of Dev.",
      "\u201cWe have known from the beginning that Ajay Dev was wrongfully convicted,\u201d Purcell told the Chronicle. \"Judge Beronio was the first judge to really look closely at the evidence and read every document.\u201d",
      "Attorney Jennifer Mouzis, who represented Ajay Dev in his appeal, said much of the prosecution\u2019s evidence was based on racial and ethnic bias that would be illegal today under California\u2019s Racial Justice Act, a 2021 law barring testimony that appeals to prejudice.",

    "summary": "Doctors, environmental groups and residents are trying to determine if there is a causal connection between pollutants from the steel industry and rates of cancer in Gary.",
    "story": [
      "Doctors, environmental groups and residents are trying to figure out if there is a causal connection between pollutants from the steel industry and rates of cancer in Gary, Indiana.",
      "Pollutants you can see, and tiny particulates you can't, come from different types of industry in the Gary region. But according to Environmental Protection Agency records, steel production plants release the most toxins of all the industries in the region.",
      "Beryl Fitzpatrick is one of the residents affected. You can hear the cancer as she speaks.",
      "\"I was having trouble swallowing,\" she recalled.",
      "Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.",
      "\"I had to learn phonics. I had to learn, I had to learn words and sounds,\" she said. \"It was humbling.\"",
      "And she knows the very air in her own backyard could be playing a role in her disease.",
      "\"It's almost certain that her place of residence, with the high pollution and other industrial output contributed to her cancer,\" said Dr. Kerstin Stenson, lead of the head and neck cancer program at Rush University Medical Center who's been treating Fitzpatrick.",
      "The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.",
      "\"A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Seven major coal-powered steel production plants operate in the United States. Three plants are clustered in the Gary region: Burns Harbor, Gary Works and Indiana Harbor.",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.",
      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",
      "The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.",
      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.",
      "\"I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,\" she said.",
      "She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.",
      "\"There are many patients that have come from that industrial area that would present with head and neck cancer without risk factors,\" Stenson said.",
      "Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.",
      "Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.",
      "\"What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,\" he said.",
      "He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.",
      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",
      "\"As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,\" she said.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs, which owns two of the plants in Northwest Indiana, did not return messages from CBS News Chicago Investigators. U.S. Steel maintains its work is essential to the health of the American economy.",
      "But Fitzgerald and others who live there worry about their own health, and they're asking lawmakers to step up and join their fight for cleaner air.",
      "The CBS News Race & Culture Unit and CBS News Data team contributed to this report.",
      "FULL STATEMENTS",
      "On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:",
      "\"In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.\"",
      "It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.",

In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",
      "\"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern,\" Thornburg said, citing a \"seasonality analysis\" that the agency has been working on about the virus.",

    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 11:53:38 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "The ruling raises a host of questions about what happens next, given that Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. Meanwhile, the court decision will likely provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil.",
      "But the ruling also introduces new layers of uncertainty. For one, the Trump administration said it intends to\u00a0appeal the ruling\u00a0to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Secondly, Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "Yes, the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But the Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. But given that some of Mr. Trump's other tariffs remain in place, U.S. businesses are still on the hook for those additional import duties. That means that while the effective tariff rate is now lower, it's still significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics.",
      "Even so, U.S. investors cheered the ruling, signaling relief from Wall Street that the overhang from the tariffs has been removed, albeit perhaps temporarily. The tariffs had raised the risks of a recession and were expected to boost inflation this year, economists had forecast.",

It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

    "summary": "Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley \"were given pretty harsh treatment,\" President Trump said on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley were pardoned\u00a0Wednesday by President Trump. The couple have been incarcerated since 2022 after being found guilty of bank and tax fraud.",
      "Todd Chrisley, 57, has been serving a 12-year sentence at Florida's FPC Pensacola minimum-security men's federal prison with a release date of April 2032, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Julie Chrisley, 52, meanwhile, has been serving a 7-year sentence at the FMC Lexington prison in Kentucky, with a release date of January 2028, the BOP says.",
      "Scott Taylor, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, told CBS News in an email that both Todd and Julie Chrisley were released from prison Wednesday.",
      "\"I am grateful to God and extremely grateful to President Trump and his entire administration. I'm beyond thankful to finally have my parents back home and my family together again!\" said Chase Chrisley, one of the couple's children, in a statement.",
      "Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley?",
      "The married couple gained prominence on the reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which debuted on the cable channel USA Network in 2014. The show depicted the wealthy couple \u2014 Todd Chrisley made his money in real estate \u2014 as they dealt with issues such as child-rearing and their careers.",
      "The show was\u00a0described as \"humorously voyeuristic\" by Common Sense Media. The program ended after 10 seasons in March 2023, after the Chrisleys were sentenced for tax and bank fraud.",
      "What were the Chrisleys convicted of?",
      "The pair were indicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in loans, with a federal jury convicting them in June 2022. The couple was also convicted of conspiring to defraud the IRS, along with additional tax crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of Georgia said at the time.",
      "The jury found that the couple submitted fake bank statements and other financial records to obtain personal loans, which they then used to buy luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "\"After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in 2022 after their conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, the couple concealed their income from their reality TV show from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The Chrisleys also failed to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "\"These convictions should send a clear message regardless of your fame or notoriety, everyone will be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes,\" said James E. Dorsey, special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, in a statement\u00a0on the Chrisley's convictions.",
      "Why did Trump pardon the Chrisleys?",
      "In a call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\" He added that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.",
      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias.\"",

      "Futures on the S&P 500 were up 67 points, or 1.1%, to 5,969 as of 7:27 a.m. EST, while contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively.",

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged 1.9%. America's largest ally in Asia had urged Mr. Trump to cancel the tariffs on imports from Japan and to also halt 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos.",

The court gave the Trump administration 10 days to issue new orders canceling the tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has canceled $766 million awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.",
      "The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.",
      "The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.",
      "The new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",
      "He added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"",
      "Dr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... \u00a0If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"",
      "H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.",
      "Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.",
      "Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",

      "\"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,\" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.",
      "The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.",
      "\"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday.",
      "Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy.",
      "\"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\"",
      "Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\"",
      "Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again.",
      "\"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\"",
      "The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about \"the rise of new bitcoin business models.\" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.",
      "Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post.",

      "\"Under the previous administration, we have been subject to\u2026it was basically a carpet bombing of the entire industry,\" Tenev said.",
      "\"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense\u2026And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\"",
      "Bitcoin \u2014 and cryptocurrency more generally \u2014 has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.",
      "Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president.",
      "Tenev weighed in on Trump's personal investment in crypto.",
      "\"Of course, it is a potential conflict,\" Tenev said, but added, \"The idea that they're motivated by personal gain\u2026I don't know if that has too much backing in fact.\"",

      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces, noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

      "By contrast, trade schools offer hands-on vocational training in fields ranging from cosmetology to plumbing, and typically don't undertake the type of research that is funded by agencies such as the NSF and National Institutes of Health, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It is both illegal and unrealistic as a proposal, and it's the sort of thing that a responsible administration shouldn't be saying,\" Jon Fansmith, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a non-profit representing higher education institutions, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"The money that has been awarded to Harvard is awarded because they competitively applied for, and were awarded, scientific research funding, which is what it overwhelmingly is.\"",
      "While other schools, including those that operate trade programs, can apply for similar grants, Harvard's money can't simply be funneled to another recipient, he said.",
      "Do trade schools get federal grants?",
      "Trade schools, which can be either for- or non-profit, typically offer certificates or associate degrees rather than the bachelor's, master's and PhDs offered by universities such as Harvard.",
      "Although a trade school could apply for and win a grant or contract for services that it's equipped to provide the government, they generally don't have the faculty, staff or facilities to undertake scientific or medical research, Albany Law School Professor Raymond Brescia told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Trade schools can apply for and get grants from the NSF or NIH if they qualify,\" he said. \"But there are rules around government procurement and awarding grants to the applicants that are best-positioned to provide the services that the government seeks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not identify any institutions that might receive Harvard's grant funding beyond referring to them as \"trade schools.\"",
      "Different focuses",
      "If Mr. Trump wanted to redirect funding, he'd likely have to follow a prescribed process, according to experts.",
      "\"You can't, as president, simply take money that Congress has directed for a certain purpose and say, 'I am going to spend it somewhere else',\" Fansmith said. \"You need some basis for giving it to other schools.\"",
      "More specifically, the Trump administration would need to provide evidence that Harvard's grants were not awarded based on merit, according to Brescia. \"Then there are avenues that the government can take in the future to ensure it follows its own procurement rules better. But I haven't heard anyone allege any awards to Harvard were improperly given to them,\" he added.",
      "A range of schools that offer trade programs compete for federal grants. For example, LaGuardia Community College in Queens, New York, part of the City University of New York, in 2023 received more than $400,000 from the U.S. Department of Labor to enhance its vocational training offerings across electrical, plumbing, HVAC and similar fields.",
      "But such schools don't generally conduct the type of academic and scientific research that qualifies for the federal grants awarded to institutions like Harvard.",
      "\"Private trade schools and community colleges don't do that stuff, so he couldn't redirect the same academic responsibility from Harvard to a trade school,\" Jason Altmire, CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group representing 800 private postsecondary career schools, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Altmire said his group's organizations don't typically receive any federal funding for academic or scientific research, while noting that trade schools would welcome additional government support and financial aid for students. But such assistance is unlikely to come in the form of grants from the NIH or NSF, he said.",
      "\"They could fund apprenticeships and support students so they have access to career schools,\" Altmire said. \"There are appropriate ways the federal government can support the work of trade schools, both private and public, and we would be excited about that.\"",

    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for an $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

      "That's according to a new report from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

      "Mr. Trump confirmed Tuesday he is \"working on\" taking Fannie and Freddie public, but will continue overseeing the two enterprises even if their conservatorship ends. He also said the \"U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES\" to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors. It's unclear what form the \"guarantee\" could take in the future.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "summary": "Trump Media, owner of the Truth Social app, says the agreement will help it create \"a bitcoin treasury.\"",
    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group on Tuesday said it's struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion that will be tapped to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "The company's move into cryptocurrency comes after Trump Media has ventured into other investment arenas, including starting exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and separately managed accounts with investment strategies the company says are \"rooted in American values and priorities.\"",
      "In its Tuesday announcement, Trump Media said it has an agreement with about 50 institutional investors to buy $1.5 billion of the company's stock, along with another $1 billion in debt that can be converted into stock at a later date. The $2.5 billion in funds will be used to create a \"bitcoin treasury,\" which the company said will be added to its balance sheet.",
      "This would be in addition to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Trump Media already holds, which it said were worth $759 million.",
      "President Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies, both through his private business and his administration. He has directed his officials to create a national \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin, ethereum and lesser-known cryptocurrencies. The goal for Trump Media \u2014 best known for its Truth Social app \u2014 is to push the company into becoming more than a tech business, according to CEO Devin Nunes.",
      "\"It's a big step forward in the company's plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles,\" Nunes said in the Tuesday statement.",
      "Shares of Trump Media tumbled $2.14, or 8.3% to $23.58 in early afternoon trading. Because the deal is based on issuing $1.5 billion worth of new shares of the company, as well $1 billion in convertible debt, the offer could dilute the value of existing shareholders' stock, including Mr. Trump's.",
      "What's happening with Truth Social?",
      "Trump Media's push into money management and cryptocurrencies comes as Truth Social continues to lose money.",
      "In the first quarter, Truth Social lost $31.2 million, while its revenue rose 7% to $821.2 million. In a May 9 regulatory filing, Trump Media said its Truth Social has \"generated limited advertising revenue\" to date, while it expects to \"incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future\" as it builds its streaming business.",
      "Social media businesses typically rely on advertising as a core source of revenue, with companies targeting their ads to specific demographics, such as app users who are, say, young parents or retirees.",
      "Truth Social doesn't release data about the size of its user base, but rival social media apps have typically recorded much higher sales growth, such as Reddit, which said its fourth-quarter ad sales jumped 60% to $394.5 million from a year earlier.",
      "Why is Trump Media venturing into financial services?",
      "Trump Media describes its new division, called Truth.Fi, as mixing financial services and financial technology.",
      "\"By expanding into this realm, we aim to serve millions of investors in America and around the world who believe in the greatness of the American economy and want to invest in superior companies while avoiding the giant, woke investment funds and politically motivated debanking problems,\" the company's May 9 regulatory filing said.",
      "\"Debanking\" is the term used by some conservative figures who have accused banks of barring them from opening accounts or blocking access to their assets because of their political views, prompting a Senate hearing in February over the issue. It's\u00a0also been the focus of some crypto investors, such as Nathan McCauley, who testified in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "Trump Media's crypto investment \"will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,\" Nunes said in the statement.",

      "Analysts noted that the stop-and-go nature of the president's tariff policies have been a key driver of market volatility in recent weeks, with stock movements hinging upon news of potential trade deals. All the while, experts say that the president's moves could be part of his overall strategy to broker new deals.",

The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday morning, found consumer confidence rose 12.3 points to reach 98.0, up from 85.7 in April. The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",
      "\"Consumer confidence in May rebounded after trade tensions eased, but this may only be temporary,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a research note.",
      "The bond market remained steady after easing slightly on Friday, after concerns earlier in the week over the nation's debt led to an uptick in Treasury Yields. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury were at 4.5% as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Still, this moment of calm may also be temporary, some economists say. In a research note on Tuesday, UBS analysts said investors should brace for more volatility in the bond market, as Mr. Trump's budget bill still\u00a0awaits approval from the Senate.",

      "At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.",
      "The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.",
      "The protesters are aiming at Tesla to dent Musk's fortunes, given that much of his wealth is tied up in shares of the electric vehicle maker.",
      "\"2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon's role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story,\" noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a May 23 research note.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-rate-funtionally-unemployed-economy/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:36:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Many workers aren't working as much as they'd like. Here's what one expert says the federal unemployment rate fails to capture.",
    "story": [
      "While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market.",
      "The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Employers are also continuing to hire despite headwinds like tariffs and plunging consumer confidence.",
      "But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the \"true rate\" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period.",
      "LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.",
      "\"The unemployment data, as it's put out, has some flaws,\" LISEP chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"For example, it counts you as employed if you've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. So you can be homeless and in a tent community and have worked one hour and be counted, irrespective of how poorly-paid that hour may be.\"",
      "LISEP, in a working paper on the gauge, says the measure prevents part-time jobs or poorly paid work from being counted as equal to full-time and better-paid work. LISEP also argues that the unemployment rate \"presents a very incomplete and, in many ways, misleading picture.\"",
      "In other words, people who lack steady work and don't earn living wages shouldn't be counted as functionally employed. Its True Rate of Unemployment (TRU), which began tracking the measure in 2020, encapsulates workers whose earnings don't allow them to make ends meet, and are struggling just to get by, according to LISEP.",
      "\"If you're part time and can't get a full-time job, then we count you as functionally unemployed,\" Ludwig noted. \"We also count as functionally unemployed people who don't earn above a poverty wage.\"",
      "\"Survival mode\"",
      "In so doing, it counts workers who can't afford to put roofs over their heads, can't procure nutritious meals and don't have the ability to save as being functionally unemployed.",
      "\"You don't have anything that gets you to the first rung of the American dream ladder. You're in survival mode,\" Ludwig said.",
      "When broken down by race and gender, TRU shows Hispanic, Black and women workers faring worse than White workers, as well as men.",
      "More than 28% of Hispanic workers, and nearly 27% of Black workers are functionally unemployed, compared to 23% of White workers. And more female workers \u2014 28.6% \u2014 are functionally unemployed than male workers, whose true rate of unemployment stands at 20%, according to LISEP.",
      "Millions of households are currently struggling to maintain a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to another recent analysis from LISEP.",
      "Its research found that the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living. These households earned an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, but would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "The wide chasm between the the BLS's measure of unemployment and its true rate of unemployment is also concerning, according to Ludwig.",
      "\"If you say there's 4.2% unemployment, which makes political folks happy because it's a low number, it causes all kinds of poor policy decisions and assumes we are better off than we are,\" Ludwig said. \"There's less energy and less of a push to improve employment, and the people who get hurt are middle- and low-income Americans.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump wrote on social media that he's \"considering\" giving $3 billion in Harvard grant money to trade schools around the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday escalated his attacks on Harvard University, saying he's considering giving $3 billion the Ivy League institution receives in grant money to trade schools across the U.S.",
      "\"I am considering taking Three Billion Dollars of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land. What a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trade schools focus on teaching practical skills for specific trades or professions.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how Mr. Trump would shift the money, and if the grants come from the Harvard funding that his administration has already frozen.",
      "Mr. Trump issued the fresh threat after he moved last week to block Harvard from enrolling international students and has taken other steps to freeze billions of dollars in Harvard's federal funding, as he claims the institution has not done enough to address anti-semitism on campus.",
      "Harvard didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The university filed a lawsuit last month in response to Mr. Trump's earlier move to strip it of\u00a0$2.2 billion in federal funding, alleging that his action was unlawful.",
      "Last week, Harvard filed a second lawsuit over the\u00a0Trump administration's attempt\u00a0to bar it from enrolling foreign students. Harvard President Alan Garber had called it a \"revocation\" that \"continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.\"",
      "A federal judge later\u00a0temporarily blocked the Trump administration from preventing Harvard from enrolling foreign students. The ruling was criticized by the White House.",
      "\"The American people elected President Trump \u2013 not random local judges with their own liberal agenda \u2013 to run the country,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said last week. \"These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also said he wants to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status as he attempts to exert control over the university's policies, including halting Harvard's diversity, equity and inclusion programs and changing its hiring practices. The Trump administration also wants to audit the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\"",
      "The White House has also taken aim at other high-profile universities, withdrawing federal funding from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University, in what is being seen an effort to coerce them into complying with the Trump administration's agenda.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The World Travel & Tourism Council projects international visitors will spend $169 billion in 2025, a nearly 7% decrease from last year.",
    "story": [
      "Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan is a small city with a thriving economy. That's because visitors from its larger northern sister city in Ontario, Canada, keep the border town's economy humming.",
      "Situated on opposite sides of the St. Marys River, the U.S. and Canadian counterparts are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, over which thousands of vehicles pass each month.",
      "\"It's so intertwined,\" said Linda Hoath, executive director of the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau, who noted that many people have family members on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. \"There's no separation between the two communities,\" she said.",
      "But with the U.S. trade war unleashed against Canada\u00a0in recent months\u00a0\u2014 along with reports of detentions of travelers at the Canadian border by U.S. immigration authorities and threats of annexation by\u00a0President Trump, the chasm between the two neighbors has grown, as fewer Canadians make the trip south to the United States.",
      "According to Sault Ste. Marie's International Bridge Administration, the passenger car traffic in April was down 44% compared with last year. And while the waning bridge traffic may not mean much from the view of Canada's second-largest province and most popular\u00a0destination, to the historic Michigan town it certainly does.",
      "\"They have 70,000 people,\" Hoath said. \"And if they're not coming over and buying in our stores, then it affects us much more.\"",
      "Slowdown in travel to the U.S.",
      "Sault Ste. Marie is not alone in its tourism concerns. Though travel this Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the highest on record, one group has been noticeably absent at U.S. travel checkpoints in recent months: international travelers.",
      "International travel to the U.S.\u00a0fell 14% in March\u00a0compared with the same period last year, according to the the U.S. Travel Association. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest dip in travel, 20.2%, was from Canada, according to research from Tourism Economics, a unit of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Trudeau urged Canadians to\u00a0refrain from vacationing in the U.S., after Mr. Trump slapped a 25% tariff\u00a0on Canadian goods. The drop-off in Canadian travel is a notable shift, given that Canada was the biggest source of inbound travel to the U.S. last year, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "As to what's behind the overall slowdown in international travel to the U.S., experts point to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, the strength of the U.S. dollar and long visa wait times. Aggressive tariff policies have also left a bad taste in many travelers' mouths.",
      "\"Shifting sentiment and perceptions of the U.S. are expected to continue to weigh heavily on travel demand,\" said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.",
      "As of April, flight bookings to the U.S. for the May\u2013July travel window are 10.8% lower than they were the same period last year, according to the research firm. It projects an 8.7% decline in international arrivals in 2025.",
      "Economic Impact",
      "The slowdown in international travel threatens to destabilize America's tourism industry which plays a vital role in supporting the nation's economy.",
      "\"International inbound travel is hugely important from an economic standpoint \u2014 people that come to the U.S. and visit spend on average $4,000 per visit,\" a spokesperson from the U.S. Travel Association, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those dollars may already be slipping away: The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that spending by international visitors to the U.S. will drop to $169 billion, or 7%, this year, from $181 billion in 2024. That's a 22.5% decrease from peak tourist spending of $217 billion in 2019, before the pandemic.",
      "Fewer international travelers could also take a toll on the workforce that props up America's tourism industry: Nearly 10% of American jobs are tied to the travel industry, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "An ongoing decline in international travel to the U.S. could result in a loss of over 230,000 jobs \u2014 with the dining and lodging industries expected to be the most hard hit, according to a recent analysis from the economic research firm IMPLAN.",
      "\"It's not going to devastate the U.S. economy in terms of GDP, but it is very significant in terms of employment,\" Jenny Thorvaldson, IMPLAN's chief economist and data officer, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hoath, who runs the visitor center in Sault Ste. Marie, said she is already worried about what those losses could mean for her community.",
      "\"When we're looking at the bridge and it's packed, people have to get their employees together,\" she said. \"But if it's not so busy, what happens to your employees? They're not making the money. Some people will be laid off.\"",
      "Hotel bookings in the city of 14,000 are already down 77% year to date, according to the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.",
      "Shifting focus to domestic travelers",
      "As international tourism dampens, local communities like Flagstaff, Arizona, are rerouting their attention to domestic travelers.",
      "Despite the city's wide international appeal, the travel season has gotten off to a slow start. Flagstaff has seen a 15% to 20% drop in international tourists year over year, according to Trace Ward, director of Flagstaff's Convention and Visitors Bureau.",
      "While he hopes that decline will only be temporary, Ward is looking for ways to bring in more American tourists. One strategy he has in mind is adding more direct flights to the area and possibly attracting a new airline. The city is also promoting its\u00a0Lowell Observatory's new Astronomy Discovery Center, which offers visitors a glimpse of the cosmos.",
      "\"I look forward to the excitement of the international traveler coming back full steam, but until then, we're gonna sell to whoever is interested in coming here,\" Ward said.",
      "Hoath, likewise, has shifted her focus toward attracting visitors from within the States, and has decided to halt spending on any advertising in Canada.",
      "\"When you don't have a ton of funds, you've got to put them where you know they have a better possibility of working,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/delta-air-lines-100th-year-takes-flight/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 09:53:33 -0400",
    "summary": "What began as the world's first aerial crop-dusting operation in the Mississippi Delta in 1925 has survived mergers, recessions and bankruptcy to become a global carrier with 5,000 flights a day.",
    "story": [
      "When you picture a garage sale, you might think of your neighbor's driveway down the street, not an aviation workshop in the shadow of the world's busiest airport, where Delta Air Lines holds their monthly surplus sale.",
      "Delta fans came from as far as Michigan and even Korea to buy the stuff the airline no longer needs, from seats to engine parts. It's a chance, these folks say, to own a piece of airline history. And how would they get the stuff home? \"We actually flew down with empty bags,\" said one man.",
      "Sarah Zeis came in search of a particular piece of Delta history: a well-used beverage cart. \"I actually need a bar cart in my apartment of these exact dimensions,\" she said.",
      "Getting it home will be a journey all its own.",
      "Proceeds from the sale go right across the parking lot, to the Delta Flight Museum, now celebrating the airline's 100th year \u2013 a first for an American carrier.",
      "It's a century of service that started without beverage carts \u2026 or passengers!",
      "According to archives director Marie Force, Delta owes its existence to a tiny pest: the boll weevil. \"It is the most unique beginning of a U.S. airline, I think,\" she said. \"It's the only airline that started as a crop-dusting company\"",
      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won. And Delta, well, yes, we have a product to compete on the lower end. [But] the majority of our revenue comes from higher-end tickets.\"",
      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile. But a mile on a runway will take you anywhere.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation that passed in the lower chamber early Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64 who are childless.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "The ruling raises a host of questions about what happens next, given that Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. Meanwhile, the court decision will likely provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil.",
      "But the ruling also introduces new layers of uncertainty. For one, the Trump administration said it intends to\u00a0appeal the ruling\u00a0to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Secondly, Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "Yes, the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But the Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. But given that some of Mr. Trump's other tariffs remain in place, U.S. businesses are still on the hook for those additional import duties. That means that while the effective tariff rate is now lower, it's still significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics.",
      "Even so, U.S. investors cheered the ruling, signaling relief from Wall Street that the overhang from the tariffs has been removed, albeit perhaps temporarily. The tariffs had raised the risks of a recession and were expected to boost inflation this year, economists had forecast.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicaid-cuts-house-bill-gop-senators-trump-agenda/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 11:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they intend to change the House-passed bill, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate will soon be considering the massive legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda after House Republicans passed it last week, following days of negotiations over changes to Medicaid, among other key issues.",
      "Senate Republicans will put their \"imprint\" on the bill, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota put it, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line for those who are undecided. As recently as Memorial Day weekend, at least one, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she's still going over the House bill: \"I'm still looking at it because it kept changing up until literally the very minute it passed.\"",
      "Medicaid is the popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The federal government shares the costs of the program with states, shouldering a minimum of 50% of the costs for richer states, while contributing more for the poorest. In 2025, it\u00a0paid\u00a077% of the Medicaid costs for Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about the changes to Medicaid in the House measure and the reaction so far by some GOP senators who have said they're concerned about the Medicaid provisions:",
      "Potential Republican opposition in the Senate",
      "Some of the House's Medicaid provisions may face resistance in the Senate. And with a narrow majority, Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three of their members if everyone votes.",
      "Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have been willing to break with their party on certain issues, say changes to Medicaid must not hurt their states. And the two senators, along with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, supported an amendment to the budget resolution that would have removed the language instructing the committee that oversees Medicaid from finding $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\" And although he's outlined his support for the legislation's work requirements, he's drawn a red line on any Medicaid benefit cuts.",
      "Expanding Medicaid work requirements",
      "The legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. A last-minute amendment to the bill would speed up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026 \u2014 a change sought by hardliners. There are exemptions for those who are caregivers for dependent children or who are pregnant, among others.",
      "Hawley likes the idea of work requirements and told the Washington Examiner in February that it's \"probably something that unites Republicans.\" Collins recently also said she supports some work requirements, and Murkowski, in a conversation with the nonprofit Foraker Group, suggested that she could support them \u2014 as long as its implementation is overseen by states, which could have \"some level of flexibility\" in applying the requirement.",
      "In a state like Alaska, Murkowski said, \"It's going to be a little bit different if you're out in a rural area where you don't have the opportunity for jobs unless you move into the city, or if you are the full-time caregiver for someone in your family.\"",
      "Cutting down on \"waste, fraud and abuse\"",
      "Republicans argue that more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients will cut down significantly on \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" The bill requires states to check at least every six months whether adults covered under the Medicaid expansion are still eligible. States would also be required to take steps to obtain enrollees' updated contact information and check a Social Security Administration database more frequently to determine whether any enrolled individuals have died. GOP senators who may be undecided on the bill have not yet indicated whether they object to this proposal.",
      "Penalizing states that provide health benefits to undocumented migrants",
      "The bill also includes a provision that would reduce federal funds to states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. Though people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage, 14 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded their state-funded health coverage to include children regardless of their immigration status, according to KFF, while seven states and D.C. cover some adults.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, 40 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid, enabling them to receive federal funding for 90% of the costs for low-income people receiving health care coverage under the expansion. The House bill would reduce the match rate to 80% for states providing health care to undocumented immigrants.",
      "Banning Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care",
      "The House bill also prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering gender transition services for children and adults, including surgeries, hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The bill initially blocked gender-affirming care for minors but was updated to include adults before its passage in the House.",
      "Freezing provider taxes",
      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion paid by the state. For instance, if the cost of a service is $1,000, and the state and federal government split is 50-50, the state might add a 5% provider tax that would bring the total cost of the service to $1,050. That would mean that the federal government would reimburse the state $525, rather than $500. The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "Murkowski cited provider taxes as one possible cost-saving measure that's \"not going to hurt Alaskans.\"",
      "\"It's about $170 billion in savings that could be had if we were to eliminate that,\" she told The Foraker Group. \"To me, that's a real savings.\"",

    "summary": "The Court of International Trade has dealt a serious blow to President Trump's tariff policy. Here's what to know about the court.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in the U.S. have challenged the Trump administration on everything from deportations of immigrants to mass layoffs of\u00a0government workers. Now, the U.S. Court of International Trade is stepping in to challenge President Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The New York-based court\u00a0late Wednesday struck down most of the tariffs implemented under Mr. Trump, dealing a serious blow to one of his signature economic policies. Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to erase the trade deficit, make the U.S. more competitive and energize the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "The ruling, which the Trump administration has already appealed, voids both a 10% baseline tariff on most countries introduced on April 2 in what the president referred to as \"Liberation Day,\" and also blocks a separate set of levies imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

      "A federal judge in Massachusetts on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on various immigration\u00a0applications, saying it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani is a reprieve for many immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine and other parts of the world whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. lawfully had been threatened by several Trump administration actions.",
      "Agreeing with pro-immigrant advocates who sued the Trump administration, Talwani found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in violation of federal administrative law.",
      "\"This court emphasizes, as it did in its prior order, that it is not in the public interest to manufacture a circumstance in which hundreds of thousands of individuals will, over the course of several months, become unlawfully present in the country, such that these individuals cannot legally work in their communities or provide for themselves and their families,\" Talwani wrote in her order.",
      "The programs at the center of Talwani's order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. President Trump's appointees have sought to curtail the use of parole, arguing that the authority was broadly abused by the Biden administration.",
      "Talwani directed the Trump administration to end a pause it quietly enacted in February to suspend the processing of immigration benefit applications filed by immigrants allowed into the U.S. under several Biden administration programs that relied on the parole authority.",
      "That pause mainly affected 240,000 Ukrainians allowed into the U.S. under a sponsorship program known as Uniting for Ukraine set up after the Russian invasion of their homeland in February 2022, as well as 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who benefited from another Biden-era parole policy. It prevented those who entered the U.S. under those policies from obtaining other forms of legal status, like asylum, Temporary Protected Status or permanent residency.",
      "Talwani ordered the government to lift another pause, issued in January, that has barred immigration officials from considering parole extension requests from Afghans, Ukrainians and other immigrant populations granted entry into the U.S. through parole programs, mostly under the Biden administration.",
      "Her ruling also blocked the Trump administration from taking any actions to stop processing parole applications under a longstanding program designed to give temporary legal relief to the immigrant relatives of U.S. service members or veterans. The administration has said this program has not been affected by its efforts to restrict the use of parole.",
      "In a statement Thursday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the law and facts of the case favored the Trump administration.",
      "\"The Biden Administration abused the parole authority to allow millions of illegal aliens into the U.S. which further fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history,\" McLaughlin said. \"Under federal law, Secretary Noem \u2014 in support of the President \u2014 has full authority to cancel or modify these policies.\"",
      "The ruling by Talwani is the second time she ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to scale back parole programs.",
      "In April, Talwani blocked the administration from moving forward with a plan to terminate the legal status and seek the deportation of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who came to the U.S. under the parole program for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Trump administration justified the move by saying the parole initiative was plagued by fraud and inadequate vetting procedures.",
      "The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to suspend Talwani's ruling from April, saying federal courts are unjustifiably interfering with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"The court's order blocks the Executive Branch from exercising its discretionary authority over a key aspect of the Nation's immigration and foreign policy and thwarts Congress's express vesting of that decision in the Secretary, not courts,\" the Justice Department wrote in a May 8 request to the Supreme Court.",

      "The federal government is working to secure a charter flight to return a man who was removed from the U.S. back to America so he can have proper due process proceedings, the Justice Department said in court documents filed Wednesday.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the man, only known by the initials O.C.G., to be returned to the United States after he found that necessary due process steps in his removal proceedings were \"ignored\" by the Trump administration.",
      "O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala.",
      "In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country.",
      "Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for ransom and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process.",
      "After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding, according to court documents.",
      "\"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.\u2014 consistent with this Court's understanding of the law\u2014that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphy wrote in his order last week. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\"",
      "Murphy had previously ordered additional fact finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand.",
      "The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error.",
      "\"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return.",
      "\"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added.",
      "The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations has drawn other scrutiny from other federal judges who argue deportees aren't being given enough due process.",
      "Another judge ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the government admitted was sent to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, but Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadoran prison, and the Trump administration says it's up to that country's government to return him.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",

      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic.

    "story": [
      "The federal government will begin revoking the visas of some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday \u2014 the latest restriction on foreign students.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" Rubio wrote in a statement.",
      "Rubio also said the government will \"revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"",
      "China is the second-largest country of origin for international students, behind only India. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States.",
      "Beijing blasted the announcement. French news agency AFP quoted foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning as saying the U.S. \"has unreasonably cancelled Chinese students' visas under the pretext of ideology and national rights. China firmly opposes this and has lodged representations with the U.S.\"",
      "The U.S. action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China. House Republicans this month pressed Duke University to cut its ties with a Chinese university, saying it allowed Chinese students to gain access to federally-funded research at Duke.",
      "Last year, House Republicans issued a report warning that hundreds of millions of dollars in defense funding was going to research partnerships linked to the Chinese government, providing \"back-door access to the very foreign adversary nation whose aggression these capabilities are necessary to protect against.\"",
      "The announcement came a day after the State Department told embassies and consulates worldwide to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa interviews, in a cable obtained by CBS News. The cable said the department is preparing \"expanded social media vetting\" of visa applicants.",
      "The two policy changes from the State Department added to uncertainty for America's international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from the Trump administration.",
      "The government has attempted to revoke legal status for thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw federal scrutiny due to minor legal infractions \u2014 though a federal judge has halted that practice. And the administration has sought to deport several pro-Palestinian student activists under a law allowing visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Earlier this week, the Trump administration tried to halt all international student enrollments at Harvard University. A judge blocked the move, part of a wider battle between the government and the Ivy League school over its handling of campus protests.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday blocked most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A federal court on Wednesday froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority.",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",

      "Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, will begin his offboarding process with the White House on Wednesday night, according to an administration official.",
      "Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts at nearly every federal agency and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts. Musk has said the effort has cut around $160 billion in spending. However, some of the spending cuts cited by DOGE have\u00a0contained errors, and one report estimates the cuts could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and the cost of putting staff on leave and re-hiring some workers.",
      "The White House said in February that Musk is a \"special government employee,\" or SGE. The designation allowed him to work for the executive branch, subject to different ethics rules than federal employees.",

      "Musk's announced departure comes a day after a\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview\u00a0where he criticized the budget bill passed by House Republicans last week. The bill has been backed heavily by Mr. Trump, who dubbed it the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent David Pogue in a broadcast exclusive interview.",
      "In an April earnings call with Musk's car company Tesla, he told investors his time at DOGE would \"drop significantly\" in May so he could focus on his companies. Musk suggested he would spend one to two days a week on government work, \"as long as the president would like me to do so.\" Some Tesla investors pushed Musk to dial back his involvement in the Trump administration, worrying his attention was divided and the carmaker's brand was at risk.",
      "White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday that the Trump administration will make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through a bill in Congress known as a rescission package, which is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent. Vought said that cuts to foreign aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as funds to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, would be included first.",

      "\"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,\" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.",
      "The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.",
      "\"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday.",
      "Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy.",
      "\"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\"",
      "Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\"",
      "Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again.",
      "\"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\"",
      "The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about \"the rise of new bitcoin business models.\" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.",

      "\"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense\u2026And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\"",
      "Bitcoin \u2014 and cryptocurrency more generally \u2014 has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.",
      "Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president.",
      "Tenev weighed in on Trump's personal investment in crypto.",
      "\"Of course, it is a potential conflict,\" Tenev said, but added, \"The idea that they're motivated by personal gain\u2026I don't know if that has too much backing in fact.\"",

    "summary": "A new term is popping up on Wall Street called \"TACO,\" which stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" The President says \"it's called negotiation.\"",
    "story": [
      "A new acronym is popping up on Wall Street to explain investors' reaction to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs: TACO.",
      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces, noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

      "The Defense Department back in February initially told employees to pause responding to the emails, but then reissued guidance directing civilian employees to respond. Non-civilian employees weren't required to participate.",
      "In a video telling civilian employees to respond, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, \"It's a simple task, as Elon [Musk] said, as the president recognized in our first cabinet meeting, just a pulse check, 'are you there?' out to DoD civilians.\"",
      "The emails were part of the Trump administration's initiative to cut down the size of the federal civilian workforce.",
      "As part of those sweeping changes, Hegseth has directed the Pentagon to cut 5-8% of civilian employees. With over 900,000 civilians working for the Defense Department, that could mean over 50,000 employees eventually leave the agency.",
      "The Defense Department has offered employees the option to leave later this year as part of the Deferred Resignation Program and is working through how many employees will leave as a result, with the option to deny resignations of mission-critical staff.",

      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves. What's more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "X-rays and radio waves are two different types of electromagnetic radiation. The correlation in their emission patterns in this case, along with other mysterious observations, led the study's authors to characterize what they found as \"unlike any known Galactic object.\"",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University's Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \"something exotic\" and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\"While our discovery doesn't yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\" Wang said. \"Either we are uncovering something entirely new, or we're seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we've never observed before.\"",

    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

    "summary": "The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as the Vienna Symphony Orchestra performs it.",
    "story": [
      "Johann Strauss II's \"Blue Danube\" is heading into space this month to mark the 200th anniversary of the waltz king's birth.",
      "The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as it's performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off on May 31 \u2014 livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York \u2014 also will celebrate the European Space Agency's founding 50 years ago.",
      "Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra's rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.",
      "The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph).",
      "That will put the music past the moon in 1 \u00bd seconds, past Mars in 4 \u00bd minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft at more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) in interstellar space.",
      "NASA also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 by transmitting a song directly into deep space: the Beatles' \"Across the Universe.\" And last year, NASA beamed up Missy Elliott's\u00a0\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" toward Venus.",
      "Music has even flowed from another planet to Earth \u2014 courtesy of a NASA Mars rover. Flight controllers at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent a recording of will.i.am's \"Reach for the Stars\" to Curiosity in 2012 and the rover relayed it back.",
      "These are all deep-space transmissions as opposed to the melodies streaming between NASA's Mission Control and orbiting crews since the mid-1960s.",
      "Now it's Strauss' turn, after getting passed over for the Voyager Golden Records nearly a half-century ago.",
      "Launched in 1977, NASA's twin Voyagers 1 and 2 each carry a gold-plated copper phonograph record, along with a stylus and playing instructions for anyone or anything out there.",
      "The records contain sounds and images of Earth as well as 90 minutes of music. The late astronomer Carl Sagan led the committee that chose Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Stravinsky pieces, along with modern and Indigenous selections.",
      "Among those skipped was Strauss, whose \"Blue Danube\" graced Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi opus \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"",
      "The tourist board in Vienna, where Strauss was born on Oct. 25, 1825, said it aims to correct this \"cosmic mistake\" by sending the \"the most famous of all waltzes\" to its destined home among the stars.",
      "ESA's big radio antenna in Spain, part of the space agency's deep-space network, will do the honors. The dish will be pointed in the direction of Voyager 1 so the \"Blue Danube\" heads that way.",
      "\"Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way,\" ESA's director general Josef Aschbacher said in a statement. \"The European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imaginations of future space scientists and explorers who may one day journey to the anthem of space.\"",

      "\"Empire of AI\" by Karen Hao",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Chapter 1",
      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

      "Saharan dust is heading toward Florida and could be seen over the state by this weekend, radar shows.",
      "Dust is forecast to hit south and central Florida on Saturday and stay for at least several days, according to CBS Miami's NEXT Weather radar.",
      "Computer models show that after an initial dust wave, a larger and denser plume could be seen in Florida by the middle of next week, CBS Orlando affiliate WKMG reports.",
      "Radar also shows dust over south Texas on Monday.",
      "Saharan dust was already seen in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands this week, the National Weather Service in San Juan reported on Tuesday. It noted dust impacts included reduced visibility and hazy skies, and said more dust is forecast to move in Saturday and linger through at least Tuesday.",
      "Satellite imagery showed dust above most of the Atlantic's tropical waters on Thursday \u2014 spanning all the way from Africa's coast to the Gulf, the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch said in a post on X. It noted that the dry air suppresses the development of storms.\u00a0Hurricane season officially starts on Sunday.",
      "It is typical for dust to move across the Atlantic every year in early summer, WKMG reports. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says it is called the Saharan Air Layer, which is \"a mass of very dry, dusty air that forms over the Sahara Desert during the late spring, summer and early fall.\"",
      "Its activity usually \"ramps up\" in the middle of June before peaking from late in the month to the middle of August, meteorologist Jason Dunion told NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service back in 2020. New \"outbreaks\" \u2014 formed when \"ripples\" in the atmosphere along the edge of the Sahara Desert kick up dust \u2014 can occur every few days and reach as far west as Florida and Texas. Dust sometimes covers areas over the Atlantic as large as the continental United States, Dunion said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-blocked-illegal-court-international-trade-ieepa-whats-next/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 11:53:38 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "The ruling raises a host of questions about what happens next, given that Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. Meanwhile, the court decision will likely provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil.",
      "But the ruling also introduces new layers of uncertainty. For one, the Trump administration said it intends to\u00a0appeal the ruling\u00a0to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Secondly, Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "Yes, the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But the Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. But given that some of Mr. Trump's other tariffs remain in place, U.S. businesses are still on the hook for those additional import duties. That means that while the effective tariff rate is now lower, it's still significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics.",
      "Even so, U.S. investors cheered the ruling, signaling relief from Wall Street that the overhang from the tariffs has been removed, albeit perhaps temporarily. The tariffs had raised the risks of a recession and were expected to boost inflation this year, economists had forecast.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicaid-cuts-house-bill-gop-senators-trump-agenda/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 11:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they intend to change the House-passed bill, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate will soon be considering the massive legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda after House Republicans passed it last week, following days of negotiations over changes to Medicaid, among other key issues.",
      "Senate Republicans will put their \"imprint\" on the bill, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota put it, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line for those who are undecided. As recently as Memorial Day weekend, at least one, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she's still going over the House bill: \"I'm still looking at it because it kept changing up until literally the very minute it passed.\"",
      "Medicaid is the popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The federal government shares the costs of the program with states, shouldering a minimum of 50% of the costs for richer states, while contributing more for the poorest. In 2025, it\u00a0paid\u00a077% of the Medicaid costs for Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about the changes to Medicaid in the House measure and the reaction so far by some GOP senators who have said they're concerned about the Medicaid provisions:",
      "Potential Republican opposition in the Senate",
      "Some of the House's Medicaid provisions may face resistance in the Senate. And with a narrow majority, Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three of their members if everyone votes.",
      "Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have been willing to break with their party on certain issues, say changes to Medicaid must not hurt their states. And the two senators, along with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, supported an amendment to the budget resolution that would have removed the language instructing the committee that oversees Medicaid from finding $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\" And although he's outlined his support for the legislation's work requirements, he's drawn a red line on any Medicaid benefit cuts.",
      "Expanding Medicaid work requirements",
      "The legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. A last-minute amendment to the bill would speed up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026 \u2014 a change sought by hardliners. There are exemptions for those who are caregivers for dependent children or who are pregnant, among others.",
      "Hawley likes the idea of work requirements and told the Washington Examiner in February that it's \"probably something that unites Republicans.\" Collins recently also said she supports some work requirements, and Murkowski, in a conversation with the nonprofit Foraker Group, suggested that she could support them \u2014 as long as its implementation is overseen by states, which could have \"some level of flexibility\" in applying the requirement.",
      "In a state like Alaska, Murkowski said, \"It's going to be a little bit different if you're out in a rural area where you don't have the opportunity for jobs unless you move into the city, or if you are the full-time caregiver for someone in your family.\"",
      "Cutting down on \"waste, fraud and abuse\"",
      "Republicans argue that more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients will cut down significantly on \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" The bill requires states to check at least every six months whether adults covered under the Medicaid expansion are still eligible. States would also be required to take steps to obtain enrollees' updated contact information and check a Social Security Administration database more frequently to determine whether any enrolled individuals have died. GOP senators who may be undecided on the bill have not yet indicated whether they object to this proposal.",
      "Penalizing states that provide health benefits to undocumented migrants",
      "The bill also includes a provision that would reduce federal funds to states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. Though people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage, 14 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded their state-funded health coverage to include children regardless of their immigration status, according to KFF, while seven states and D.C. cover some adults.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, 40 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid, enabling them to receive federal funding for 90% of the costs for low-income people receiving health care coverage under the expansion. The House bill would reduce the match rate to 80% for states providing health care to undocumented immigrants.",
      "Banning Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care",
      "The House bill also prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering gender transition services for children and adults, including surgeries, hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The bill initially blocked gender-affirming care for minors but was updated to include adults before its passage in the House.",
      "Freezing provider taxes",
      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion paid by the state. For instance, if the cost of a service is $1,000, and the state and federal government split is 50-50, the state might add a 5% provider tax that would bring the total cost of the service to $1,050. That would mean that the federal government would reimburse the state $525, rather than $500. The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "Murkowski cited provider taxes as one possible cost-saving measure that's \"not going to hurt Alaskans.\"",
      "\"It's about $170 billion in savings that could be had if we were to eliminate that,\" she told The Foraker Group. \"To me, that's a real savings.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in the U.S. have challenged the Trump administration on everything from deportations of immigrants to mass layoffs of\u00a0government workers. Now, the U.S. Court of International Trade is stepping in to challenge President Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The New York-based court\u00a0late Wednesday struck down most of the tariffs implemented under Mr. Trump, dealing a serious blow to one of his signature economic policies. Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to erase the trade deficit, make the U.S. more competitive and energize the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "The ruling, which the Trump administration has already appealed, voids both a 10% baseline tariff on most countries introduced on April 2 in what the president referred to as \"Liberation Day,\" and also blocks a separate set of levies imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

      "Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley?",
      "The married couple gained prominence on the reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which debuted on the cable channel USA Network in 2014. The show depicted the wealthy couple \u2014 Todd Chrisley made his money in real estate \u2014 as they dealt with issues such as child-rearing and their careers.",
      "The show was\u00a0described as \"humorously voyeuristic\" by Common Sense Media. The program ended after 10 seasons in March 2023, after the Chrisleys were sentenced for tax and bank fraud.",
      "What were the Chrisleys convicted of?",
      "The pair were indicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in loans, with a federal jury convicting them in June 2022. The couple was also convicted of conspiring to defraud the IRS, along with additional tax crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of Georgia said at the time.",
      "The jury found that the couple submitted fake bank statements and other financial records to obtain personal loans, which they then used to buy luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "\"After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in 2022 after their conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, the couple concealed their income from their reality TV show from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The Chrisleys also failed to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "\"These convictions should send a clear message regardless of your fame or notoriety, everyone will be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes,\" said James E. Dorsey, special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, in a statement\u00a0on the Chrisley's convictions.",
      "Why did Trump pardon the Chrisleys?",
      "In a call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\" He added that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.",
      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile.

      "They alleged Grimm employed unauthorized workers whom he paid \"off the books\" in cash, took deliberate steps to obstruct the federal and state governments from collecting taxes he properly owed, cheated the state of New York out of workers' compensation insurance premiums, caused numerous false business and personal tax returns to be filed for several years and lied under oath to cover up his crimes.",

      "\"Though the defendant casts himself as an individual with a life 'nothing short of extraordinary in its commitment to service to this country and those in need', his habit of falsely denying and minimizing his criminal conduct and impugning anyone who questions him is indicative of an individual who has not come to terms with his own crimes,\" the Justice Department argued.",
      "Grimm won reelection in 2014 in spite of his indictment, but he pleaded guilty a month later to one count of tax fraud. He resigned from Congress in January 2015 and served eight months in prison.",
      "He was released from prison in May 2016, after serving approximately half a year.",
      "Grimm, who was former Marine and FBI agent before he was elected to Congress, represented Staten Island and part of Brooklyn from 2011 to 2015.",

      "Two inmates \u2014 Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves \u2014  who were among 10 people who\u00a0escaped from a New Orleans jail nearly two weeks ago may be in other cities, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CBS News in an interview on Wednesday.",
      "Eight of the 10 Orleans Parish Prison inmates have been recaptured after their May 16 jailbreak went unnoticed for hours. Some of them were found within the city's famous French Quarter and others elsewhere within the state of Louisiana, but two of them were found in Texas\u00a0following extensive surveillance efforts by the U.S. Marshals, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "Attorney General Murrill said the escapees' primary networks are based in New Orleans, and the high-profile case makes it tougher for them to walk around without being noticed.",
      "\"They can keep running, but they can't hide forever,\" Murrill said, adding that she's confident the two who are still on the run will be taken into custody.",
      "Investigations into what Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry called the worst jailbreak in recent state history are ongoing, with at least 13 people arrested in connection with the breakout.",
      "The state's top prosecutor said there are several factors that led to the escape, including the court system, jail staffing and infrastructure issues. A high-priority problem, Murrill added, is the issue of slow-moving criminal cases in the district's court system, which she says has led to overcrowding at the facility.",
      "Although one-third of the jail's security cameras weren't working at the time, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, one\u00a0surveillance video\u00a0captured several inmates forcing open a cell door at about 12:22 a.m. CDT and breaching a wall behind the cell's toilet. At around 1 a.m., video showed, the inmates fled the building through a nearby loading dock, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office.",
      "The escape went unnoticed by the sheriff's office until approximately 8:30 a.m. that day. At the time of the escape, no sheriff's deputy was assigned to the area where the inmates initiated the jailbreak.",
      "The sheriff's office also said last week that locks on the cells were defective and the escapees were housed in that particular unit due to ongoing renovations at their previous unit, including new locks being installed.",
      "Murrill, who visited the jail on Tuesday, said that one unit has had all hinges and locks replaced, while another 160 cells need to have the same work done.",
      "\"I think that there is hardening that needs to happen at that facility that's just physical changes to things like light bulbs and locks that needs to happen,\" Murrill said Wednesday. \"But at the end of all this, you really have to be able to efficiently move cases, or you're still going to have a continuing problem with a violent population that's there for a very long time, and will continue to beat up and exploit any kind of weakness they can find in that facility.\"",
      "In a post on X, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office announced \"significant flooding\" problems at the jail following the escape, writing, \"despite emergency repairs over the weekend, the plumbing challenges still remain, and water is continuing to accumulate in parts of the facility.\"",
      "The sheriff's office added, \"OPSO is working to bring in an external water supply to temporarily accommodate the plumbing issue.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, inmates at the facility yelled out to CBS News cameras outside the facility, \"we need water.\"",
      "The attorney general said she has spoken with the sheriff about those issues, as well.",
      "The dysfunction at the correctional facility dates back generations. In 1970, a federal judge declaring its overcrowding to be unconstitutional in 1970. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina stranded inmates in chest-high water and left the jail without power. In 2013, a video showed inmates using drugs, drinking beer and brandishing a gun.",
      "Issues continued even after the 2015 opening of the state-of-the-art Orleans Justice Center, which houses nearly 1,400 inmates. There were major issues with the building from the outset, including a lack of supervision and adequate housing for mentally ill inmates, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Following the escape nearly two weeks ago, Gov. Landry ordered the removal of all remaining state Department of Corrections prison inmates from the facility.",
      "The Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams also vocalized concerns about the sheriff's office's ability to securely conduct business, telling CBS News in an interview Monday night he plans to request for a private security detail to temporarily secure the New Orleans courthouse.",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who oversees the jail, said she \"takes full accountability\" for the escape. She also\u00a0announced\u00a0she was temporarily suspending her reelection campaign, saying, in part: \"Now is the time to focus on security, accountability, and public safety.\"",
      "When asked what policy changes need to happen to ensure another jailbreak doesn't happen, Murrill said: \"I think that jail officials know the population at their jail, and they know whether that it's suitable for the population that they have.\"",
      "She added that everyone in the community needs to be paying attention and \"participates in insisting that the leadership, the facility, and the court system are all doing their part to protect us and to move these cases through.\"",

His grandfather, who was born in 1790, left the Oval Office more than 179 years ago, after serving from 1841 to 1845, well before the Civil War. President Tyler's immediate descendants lived into the modern age because of two generations of late second marriages to much younger wives.",
      "John Tyler, a Virginian slave owner and lifelong Democrat, served as the vice president to William Henry Harrison and became president quite unexpectedly after Harrison died suddenly\u00a0three weeks after his inauguration \u2014 the first president to die while in office.",
      "At the time, succession plans weren't fully established and Tyler was initially hesitant about taking over, according to the National Constitution Center. He took the oath of office in public on April 6, 1841, saying, \"I am the President, and I shall be held responsible for my administration.\"",
      "John Tyler was married twice and had 15 children \u2014 eight children with his first wife, Letitia, who died from a stroke, and then seven more with his second wife, Julia Gardiner Tyler, who was 24 when they married. He fathered most of the second set of children in his 50s and 60s; his last child, a daughter named Pearl, was born when he was 70 years old, according to the University of Virginia's Miller Center.",
      "Tyler's 13th child, Lyon, was born when his father was 63 years old. Lyon Gardiner Tyler, who served as president of William and Mary College, also married twice. With his second wife, Sue Ruffin Tyler, he had two sons born in the 1920s, when Lyon was in his 70s, according to\u00a0Encyclopedia Virginia.",
      "One of those children was Harrison Ruffin Tyler.",
      "Harrison Ruffin Tyler lived in Virginia and co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company, in 1968.

    "summary": "A new term is popping up on Wall Street called \"TACO,\" which stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" The President says \"it's called negotiation.\"",
    "story": [
      "A new acronym is popping up on Wall Street to explain investors' reaction to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs: TACO.",
      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces, noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

    "summary": "Swiss authorities tell CBS News the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is \"not fulfilling various legal obligations\" in that country.",
    "story": [
      "London - The controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose operations got off to a chaotic start this week in the war-torn Palestinian territory, says it is winding down its Swiss operation after three months. The move comes as Swiss authorities said GHF was breaching rules for foundations registered in that country. GHF told CBS News that moving forward, its only operations would be based out of the United States.",
      "The legal complication for GHF in Switzerland emerged as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said one Palestinian was killed and 47 others were wounded when Israeli forces fired shots as\u00a0people were seeking food at one of its aid distribution hubs\u00a0in southern Gaza on Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Tuesday that troops had only fired \"warning shots\" to restore order at the site. GHF later said in a statement that \"no shots were fired at Palestinian crowds\" and \"there were no casualties.\" Some injured Palestinians could be seen in video footage of the incident verified by CBS News Confirmed, which showed hundreds of people around the distribution center.",
      "Little has been made public about GHF, including who funds it. CBS News has been told by one source that GHF has employed at least 300 American contractors, all heavily armed, who have been given \"as much ammunition as they can carry.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said, according to a document obtained by CBS News that appears to have been written by the group, that it was registering in both Delaware and Geneva, Switzerland. The Swiss \"affiliate\" was established in order to \"address donors who would prefer to participate outside of the U.S. structure,\" the document says.",
      "\"The Swiss GHF Board and Executive team will closely mirror that of the U.S. GHF and will adhere to the same principles, mission and values,\" says the document.",
      "A separate document seeking to register the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in Switzerland, dated Jan. 31, 2025, was published as part of the country's commercial register. The foundation is shown as being registered from Feb. 12.",
      "According to the Swiss registration document, \"the foundation pursues exclusively charitable and philanthropic objectives for the benefit of people in need of support for material, psychological or health reasons, and more specifically to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in the Gaza Strip, including the secure provision of food, water, medicine, shelter and reconstruction.\"",
      "It lists three individuals as leaders of the Swiss foundation: David Papazian, who the document says is from Armenia but based in the U.K.; Lolk Samuel Marcel Henderson, an American in Arlington, Virginia; and David Kohler, from Switzerland.",
      "Subsequent documents, dated May 19 and May 23 respectively, announced the removal of Swiss national Kohler from the board of the foundation, and then the end of Swiss accounting firm OGH Expertises Comptables et Fiscales SA's role as an auditor of the foundation.",
      "Switzerland's Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations, known as the ESA, told CBS News on Wednesday that, according to its assessment, the Swiss branch of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is \"currently not fulfilling various legal obligations,\" in the country.",
      "The ESA said the aid group's Swiss branch does not have the required signatory member of its board resident in Switzerland, that it doesn't have the minimum three board members required by Swiss statutes, and that it did not appear to have a Swiss bank account, a valid Swiss address, or an auditor \u2014 all of which are requirements for foundations like GHF which are registered in the country.",
      "\"Based on this information, the ESA assumes that the Swiss foundation has not yet commenced its activities and is therefore inactive,\" the authority told CBS News. \"The ESA has informed the foundation of its legal requirements and requested that it clarify the situation. The necessary clarifications are currently under way.\"",
      "A Swiss non-governmental watchdog organization, TRIAL International, said it had filed two legal submissions to the Swiss government on May 20 and 21, with the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations and the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, seeking to assess GHF's compliance with the Swiss legal system, as well as with Switzerland's Federal Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad.",
      "The legal submissions were \"intended to urgently remedy potential breaches by the GHF of various rules of national and international law, in particular concerning 'private security services' within the framework of the foundation's activities, such as the militarized security of distribution points and the control of individuals,\" the NGO said in a statement.",
      "Switzerland \"has a moral but also a particular legal obligation to make sure that entities operating from its territory, themselves, respect the Geneva Conventions. That's enshrined in the first article of the Geneva Conventions,\" TRIAL International director Philip Grant told CBS News.",
      "\"So we just wanted to understand what they did\" through the Swiss entity, he said.",
      "Grant said it was unclear how much GHF activity had actually taken place in Geneva, which was part of the motivation for his group's submissions. It was also looking to find out whether GHF had requested and received necessary approvals to engage private military services, the use of which is tightly regulated under Swiss law for organizations registered in the country.",
      "In response to CBS News' request for clarity, GHF said Wednesday that \"the only GHF entity that is in use today is the foundation established in the United States by Loik Henderson in February 2025. That is the only entity through which GHF is operating and will operate moving forward. Swiss entity was created as a contingency; is not operational; and is being wound down.\"",
      "James Smith, a doctor who has worked inside Gaza, told CBS News that both the presence of armed contractors at aid distribution centers and the locations of GHF's hubs in the south of Gaza raise red flags for humanitarian workers. He said the location of the hubs could potentially serve as a way to forcibly displace the population of Gaza to the south of the Strip.",
      "\"They are undignified. They are inhumane. We've seen people being corralled into cages in the baking heat,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith pointed out concerns raised by the United Nations, which has declined to work with the organization, about the methods of GHF and even \"some of the people that, until the last couple of days, worked for GHF and have since resigned, saying that they cannot adhere to the humanitarian principles if they continue to work for this entity.\"",
      "\"The risks posed by armed military actors, particularly those who are parties to a conflict, also providing humanitarian assistance should be and has been roundly condemned and is not something that any reputable humanitarian organization, academic of humanitarianism or humanitarian practitioner should ever support,\" Smith said.",

      "A South African court on Thursday sentenced a woman to life in prison for kidnapping and selling her six-year-old daughter, in a case that horrified the country.",
      "Joshlin Smith went missing in February last year from her home in Saldanha Bay, a fishing town 85 miles north of Cape Town, and has never been found.",
      "Her mother, Racquel \"Kelly\" Smith, was found guilty of kidnapping and selling the young girl, reportedly for 20,000 rand ($1,100).",
      "Judge Nathan Erasmus ruled that Smith, 35, and her two co-accused -- a boyfriend and mutual friend -- also be jailed for life for human trafficking.",
      "They were all sentenced to a concurrent 10 years imprisonment for kidnapping.",
      "\"I am also ordering the entry of your names to the child protection register,\" Erasmus ruled. \"There is nothing that I can find that is redeeming and deserving of a lesser sentence than the harshest I can impose,\" he said.",
      "Erasmus said the fact that Smith and her two co-defendants were drug users was no excuse, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Smith was present in court and sat through the hour-long proceeding with an impassive gaze.",
      "The judge said the mother of three was manipulative and had shown \"no indication of remorse\" or concern over Joshlin's disappearance.",
      "The verdict drew cheers in the courtroom.",
      "Joshlin's grandmother was also present in court in a white shirt emblazoned with images of the young girl.",
      "Dramatic turns after Joshin vanished",
      "Smith was initially a figure of sympathy when her child disappeared, sparking a massive nationwide search operation.",
      "Photos showing Joshlin's striking green eyes, broad smile and brown pigtails flooded the internet.",
      "The case drew national attention, including from a minister who offered a one-million-rand ($54,000) reward for her safe return.",
      "But it took a turn when prosecutors alleged that Smith sold her daughter to a traditional healer, who was interested in her eyes and fair complexion.",
      "The judge didn't say in his ruling who the girl was sold to or why.",
      "Witnesses in the trial, which began in March, included the girl's teacher and a pastor, who said the mother had told him of the planned sale of her child in 2023.",
      "Police said on Thursday they had extended the search beyond South Africa's borders.",
      "South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in the world and the kidnapping of children is on the rise.",
      "There were more than 17,000 kidnappings in South Africa in the 2023/2024 financial year, an 11 percent increase over the previous year, according to police statistics. The data doesn't specify the ages of the victims.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that the de facto leader of Hamas, Mohammed Sinwar, has been killed. Netanyahu mentioned the killing in a speech to Israel's parliament as the U.S. seeks another temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "During his speech, Netanyahu listed the names of top Hamas leaders killed during the war and included Sinwar. \"We have killed tens of thousands of terrorists. We killed (Mohammed) Deif, (Ismail) Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Sinwar,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu did not elaborate, and Israel's military did not immediately issue any new statement on Sinwar's apparent death.",
      "Sinwar was the latest leader of Hamas \u2014 which the U.S. and Israel have designated as a terrorist group \u2014 to be killed by Israeli forces. His older brother Yahya Sinwar, a top target for the Israeli military who previously led the group, was killed in October. Deif, who led Hamas' military wing, was killed by Israeli forces in July. Haniyeh, a former Hamas political leader, was assassinated in Iran last year, an incident Iran blamed on Israeli forces but Israel did not take responsibility for.",
      "Since Yahya Sinwar's death, Mohammed Sinwar had been widely described in Israeli and Arab media as one of Hamas' top leaders in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Top Hamas leaders based in Qatar didn't pick Mohammed Sinwar as the group's sole leader after his brother's death, but militants in the Gaza Strip have largely followed him, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year, citing Arab negotiators. The younger Sinwar \u2014 a longtime Hamas member \u2014 has helped lead the group as it recruits new fighters, replacing some of the thousands of Hamas terrorists Israel says it has killed, according to the newspaper.",
      "\"Mohammed Sinwar is managing everything,\" retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi told the Journal.",
      "Mohammed Sinwar's reported death comes after nearly 20 months of war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas-led militants launched an attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "At the White House, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters Wednesday he had \"very good feelings\" about getting to a temporary ceasefire and a long-term resolution to the conflict.",
      "A two-month ceasefire between the two sides ended in March after Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip and enforced a blockade on all aid supplies entering the Palestinian territory, leading to widespread reports of shortages and hunger. Israel blames all the suffering in Gaza on Hamas, calling the blockade a tactic to pressure the terrorist group into releasing the 58 remaining hostages, although it is unclear how many are alive.",
      "In recent weeks, Israeli officials have vowed to push ahead with the war to capture and control the entire Gaza Strip and to dismantle Hamas, though Israel has allowed limited aid to enter Gaza this week.",
      "Over 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began more than a year and a half ago, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Earlier this month, Hamas released Eden Alexander, believed to have been the last living American citizen held hostage in Gaza.",
      "The families of the remaining hostages have led large protests demanding that Netanyahu make a deal to bring their loved ones home and end the war. In a statement shared by his office following the release of Alexander, Netanyahu insisted that while there could be a temporary ceasefire to allow for more hostages to be freed, there is \"no way we will stop the war \u2026 we're going to the end.\"",

      "Russia's military has committed \"crimes against humanity\" and \"war crimes\" in its drone attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine's Kherson region in particular, a panel of United Nations experts concludes in a report published Wednesday. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the U.N. Human Rights Council, said Russian armed forces were \"systematically\" hitting civilians.",
      "\"Russian armed forces have committed the crimes against humanity of murder and the war crimes of attacking civilians, through a months-long pattern of drone attacks targeting civilians on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Province,\" the inquiry said in its atypically blunt assessment. \"These acts were committed with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population, in violation of international humanitarian law.\"",

      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",

      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",
      "The screenings are part of a wider slate of controls aimed at international students \u2014 some of which have run into pushback from the court system.",

    "summary": "Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, called an \"atomic bomb of pedophilia\" in court, has been sentenced to prison for abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children.",
    "story": [
      "Vannes, France\u00a0\u2014 A French court on Wednesday gave the maximum 20-year jail term to a surgeon who admitted sexually abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, during more than two decades.\u00a0The three-month trial of Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, has brought to light the extent of his crimes and the suffering of his victims but also raised questions of why more was not done sooner to stop him.",
      "Le Scouarnec, one of the most prolific convicted sex predators in France's history, was already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.",
      "The 20-year sentence for aggravated rape handed down by presiding judge Aude Buresi was the maximum that could be given on the charge of aggravated rape in France, where sentences are not added together on individual counts.",
      "Le Scouarnec will not be able to ask for parole until two-thirds of the verdict is served.",
      "\"It was taken into account that the acts committed are of particular gravity due to the number of victims, their young age and the compulsive nature\" of the crimes, said the verdict.",
      "But the court rejected a rare demand from prosecutors that he should be held in a center for treatment and supervision even after any release, citing his \"desire to make amends\" for what he had done.",
      "The prosecutor has said last week that in the United States \u2014 where the opposite is the case \u2014 Le Scouarnec could have been jailed for \"2,000 years.\"",
      "In this trial, which began in February in Vannes in the western region of Brittany, Le Scouarnec has admitted sexually assaulting or raping 299 patients \u2014 256 of them under 15 \u2014 in hospitals between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anesthesia or waking up after operations.",
      "He was charged with 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults.",
      "In March, during the trial, Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter, too, though she was not among the alleged victims in the case.",
      "The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in the trial, gave evidence.",
      "\"This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger and his distress,\" Le Scouarnec told the court that day. \"I respect that anger, it is well-founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter.\"",
      "He then turned to his son and said, \"forgive me.\"",
      "Survivors of the surgeon's abuse staged a protest outside the court in Vannes, holding signs such as \"Never again\" and \"I accuse you.\"",
      "They also held signs representing 355 victims of Le Scouarnec.",
      "That number included \"forgotten victims and those whose cases have been dismissed,\" said Manon Lemoine, one of the victims.",
      "\"We want to be together,\" she said.",
      "Another victim, Celine Mahuteau, on Wednesday sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron saying that France has not implemented a national policy \"to prevent pedophilia.\"",
      "\"I am not asking the court for leniency,\" Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement on Monday.",
      "\"Simply grant me the right to become a better person,\" he said.",
      "One of the lawyers, Maxime Tessier, had asked the court to take into account the \"exceptional\" nature of Le Scouarnec's confession when he admitted all the charges against him.",
      "The retired surgeon also said he considered himself \"responsible\" for the death of two of his victims \u2014 Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.",
      "Le Scouarnec documented his crimes, noting his victims' names, ages, addresses and the nature of the abuse.",
      "In his notes, the doctor described himself as a \"major pervert\" and a \"pedophile.\"",
      "\"And I am very happy about it,\" he recorded.",
      "Victims and child rights advocates say the case highlights systemic failures that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.",
      "In 2005, he received a four-month suspended prison sentence after investigators linked his credit card to the online purchase of child sexual abuse material.",
      "But Le Scouarnec was neither required to undergo treatment nor barred from practicing medicine.",
      "While Le Scouarnec has asked his victims for forgiveness, many of them have questioned the sincerity of his apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial.",
      "\"You are the worst mass pedophile who ever lived,\" said one of the lawyers representing the victims, Thomas Delaby, describing Le Scouarnec as an \"atomic bomb of pedophilia.\"",
      "There has been frustration among some that the trial has not had the impact in France they hoped for.",
      "The case has not won the attention given to the case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed last year for recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his now ex-wife Gisele.",
      "But Health Minister Yannick Neuder said on Wednesday he would work with Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin to ensure that \"never again will we find ourselves in a situation where patients and vulnerable children\" are exposed to predators.",
      "\"What we want to say is never again,\" he told broadcaster France Info. \"How did we get into this situation?\"",

      "Onosato is from Ishikawa prefecture, which was hit on Jan. 1, 2024, by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed about 600 people in the prefecture and caused widespread damage. Much of the destruction was centered on an area known as the Noto Peninsula.",
      "\"I will work hard as a yokozuna to encourage and cheer up the Ishikawa prefecture and the Noto region,\" he said.",
      "He then added: \"I determined that yokozuna should be my goal once I entered the world of sumo,\" he said. \"It's not easy to achieve and I'm really delighted.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

Joseph Harris-Birtill, born on Nov. 23, 2021, was admitted to the organization at the age of just 2 years and 182 days.",
      "\"It soon became clear that he was an exceptional little being,\" Harris-Birtill's mother Rose told Guinness World Records. \"He first rolled over at five weeks, said his first word at seven months, and read his first book out loud from cover to cover at one-and-three-quarter years.\"",
      "\"He's learning morse code, knows the Greek alphabet, and has recently gotten interested in the periodic table,\" his mother said. \"His interests are vast and varied, and he is always keen to learn more and loves a challenge.\"",
      "Harris-Birtill's parents \u2014 who both work at Scotland's prestigious University of St. Andrews \u2014 told Guinness World Records they first decided to reach out to Mensa to find more support for Joseph after seeing how early he'd started reading.",
      "\"I searched online for any further support available, and saw that Mensa offers resources and membership for highly able children,\" Rose said. \"We hope that this accomplishment can give him a sense of pride when he is older \u2014 it's a very unusual accolade and the credit is all his!\"",
      "Harris-Birtill is 13 days younger than the youngest female member of Mensa was, American\u00a0Isla McNabb, when she was admitted to the club in 2022.

      "\"It is a common misconception that everything is super easy for gifted children. But everyone needs appropriate stimulation and understanding throughout their lives, and highly able learners can sadly have their unique talents dimmed by the pressure to fit into environments that simply haven't been properly designed for them,\" she told Guinness World Records. \"Joseph is fortunate enough to attend a brilliant nursery and has an excellent music teacher, and in Mensa we hope to provide him with a community of peers as a source of further support as his formidable intellect continues to grow and develop.\"",

After the accusers' demands were not met, they filed the lawsuit and \"created a media circus and made a public spectacle of themselves,\" the lawsuit stated.",

That safe and the valuables it contained and several gold Kruggerands were later stolen by someone who knew precisely where they were located. The Robinsons reported the theft to the police.\"",
      "Additionally, the Robinsons' lawyers state that Frances had discovered that she was missing financial records, including bank statements, and noted \"at least one Plaintiff had access to and knew exactly where these records were kept.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio first announced plans in April to restructure the agency because the department was \"bloated, bureaucratic, and unable to perform its essential diplomatic mission.\"",
      "The State Department submitted a notice to Congress Thursday disclosing plans for the overhaul \u2014 the largest restructuring for the agency since the Cold War, senior State Department officials told Fox News Digital.",
      "The agency\u2019s overhaul aims to cut red tape so the department can respond to threats more quickly, place greater emphasis on the agency\u2019s \"primary mission\" representing the U.S. abroad and eliminate \"bureaucratic overgrowth\" in Washington, the congressional notice said.",

      "As the White House trims over 100 aides from its National Security Council staff, some former officials and analysts are asking if the smaller team can meet the demands of a fast-moving and dangerous global security environment.",
      "Roughly half of the NSC\u2019s 350-person team will depart in what the White House is calling a \"right-sizing\" of a historically bureaucratic body composed largely of career diplomats \u2013 many of whom are seen as out of step with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "Aides originally on loan from agencies like the State Department and the Pentagon are being sent back to their home departments. Political appointees placed on administrative leave have been told the White House will find other roles for them elsewhere in the administration.",
      "Some former NSC officials told Fox News Digital it's too early to tell whether the overhaul will result in a more efficient agency \u2013 or one ill-equipped to deliver timely intelligence for national security decisions.",

      "Privately, national security sources questioned whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is currently serving as interim national security advisor, might be paring back the agency to avoid internal power struggles once he returns to his original post.",
      "Michael Allen, a former senior director at the NSC, said the staffing changes reflect President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for direct control over key decisions.",
      "\"I think he wants people to bring decisions to him earlier than previous presidents,\" Allen told Fox News Digital.",
      "The NSC has charted rocky waters since it lost national security advisor Mike Waltz following the inadvertently publicized Signal chat. His deputy, Alex Wong, also recently departed the agency, and other aides who had a large impact on the administration's early foreign policy decisions were pushed out in Friday's restructuring.",
      "Eric Trager, the senior director for Middle East issues who traveled with envoy Steve Witkoff for some of his Iran negotiations, is out. So is Andrew Peek, senior director for Europe and Eurasia, who helped coordinate the approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",

      "\"This happens naturally on NSCs, the kind of stasis we saw in the Biden administration is highly untypical,\" said Victoria Coates, former deputy national security advisor to Trump.",
      "She noted that President Ronald Reagan had six national security advisors over two terms as president, in addition to two acting NSAs.",
      "\"For the president, he has legitimate concerns about the NSC from the first term, given what happened, and then, you know, there's no sugar-coating it: the situation with Signalgate was a problem for NSA Waltz,\" Coates went on. \"The president is taking actions to get the NSC into a condition that he would have complete confidence in it.\"",
      "With a slimmer NSC, the president is expected to lean more heavily on Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for his daily intelligence briefings.",
      "\"One thing that makes this administration unique is that it\u2019s the president himself and a small circle of advisors who truly matter and make decisions,\" said Brian Katulis, a former NSC official and fellow at the Middle East Institute. \"They just don't see the need for ongoing interagency meetings like in previous administrations.\"",
      "Katulis added that the biggest risk isn\u2019t necessarily a lack of intelligence \u2013 but a lack of coordination.",

      "\"The NSC under Democratic presidents grows to 300, 400 people,\" said former Trump NSC official Alex Gray. \"It becomes its own department.\"",
      "\"When I was there, we took it down to about 110 people doing policy \u2013 and it could probably go down another 50 and still be effective,\" he said.",
      "\"Do you want an NSC that formulates and directs policy, or one that gives the president advice, lets him decide, and then implements it? You don\u2019t need hundreds of people to do that.\"",
      "But the NSC is the primary agency tasked with making sure other agencies are in line with the president's agenda.",
      "\"Rather than preparing options for him, they should take his direction and implement it,\" said Coates. \u00a0But, she added, \"if you take it down too far, it's not going to have the manpower to implement those directions from the White House into the departments and agencies which are always bigger and better funded than the NSC.\"",

      "Even with a leaner staff, the NSC remains responsible for managing critical global challenges \u2013 from Iran nuclear talks and the war in Ukraine to military competition with China.",
      "That puts added pressure on Rubio, who will bear the blame if any crucial intelligence slips through the cracks.",
      "\"The big issue is the national security advisor needs to make sure the president has all the information he needs to make a decision,\" Allen said.",

      "\"If you have to think about the four things that we're doing in Medicaid to strengthen it, we're removing anybody that is illegal, ineligible or duplicate, and we're ensuring that able-bodied adults, on the expansion population, have a very modest work requirement, in exchange for receiving benefits. Those things are overwhelmingly supported by the American people, yet the Democrats continue to lie about what this bill is actually doing,\" Houchin said.",

Their saying anything to the contrary is just them trying to protect their already in danger majority.\"",

The bill passed just 215 to 214, and all Democrats voted against it. Republicans' slim majority managed to deliver a legislative win for Trump.",

      "The sweeping, multitrillion-dollar legislation advances Trump's agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. The bill includes Trump's key campaign promises, including no tax on tips and overtime, and it seeks to permanently extend his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
      "\"By passing the largest cut to Medicaid in history, Republicans are ripping away health care from millions of Americans and levying a de facto hidden tax on working-class families,\" DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement after the bill passed. \"Now that vulnerable Republicans are\u00a0on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026.\"",

      "\"This is great,\" Carney said. \"The Ten Commandments are good. It's basically the moral code for most people who have ever lived. No matter what their belief system, most people don\u2019t believe we should steal, kill, or commit adultery.",

      "Carney, who leads what he describes as the world\u2019s largest pro-life organization, operating in 64 countries, linked the legislation to a broader cultural shift.

      "Looking to the future, Carney hopes the bill encourages greater moral formation nationwide.",

      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",

      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",

It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",

      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",

      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",
      "A man looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "10 SIGNS YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED",
      "Aggressive US rollout targets 180M users",
      "World ID is currently available in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, Miami and San Francisco, with plans to expand further. The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users. While the technology promises enhanced security, the debate over its privacy implications continues to grow.",

      "THINK YOU'RE SAFE? IDENTITY THEFT COULD WIPE OUT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE'S SAVINGS",
      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms. However, the storage of sensitive biometric data in a global database will always raise concerns for many.",

      "Imagine your phone rings and the voice on the other end sounds just like your boss, a close friend, or even a government official. They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.",
      "That's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",

      "Illustration of cybersecurity risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "Criminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include:",
      "Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitationsPhrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenariosAsking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",

      "Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios",
      "Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "Poisoned AI models are spreading misinformation",
      "Sometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens:",
      "Training poisoning: Attackers sneak false or harmful data into the model during developmentRetrieval poisoning: Misleading content online gets planted, which the AI later picks up when generating answers",

      "A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.",

      "AI-powered cybercrime blends realism, speed, and scale. These scams are not just harder to detect. They are also easier to launch. Here\u2019s how to stay protected:",
      "1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:\u00a0Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "How much storage does this thing have",
      "City living often means making tough choices about what you can carry with you. The Acticycle makes that a non-issue. With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "What does the Acticycle cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

      "We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky.",
      "Now, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers.",

      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center published\u00a0a public service announcement on May 7, 2025, cautioning both individuals and organizations that criminals are taking advantage of outdated routers that no longer receive security patches.",
      "Devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously.",
      "In essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame.",

      "WHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE?",
      "How hackers exploit these routers",
      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from router hackers",
      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.",

      "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.",
      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",
      "Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it\u2019s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:",
      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.",
      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",

      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation.

    "summary": "AI technology in NYC subways aims to improve safety by monitoring behavior patterns, led by MTA&apos;s Michael Kemper, while ensuring rider privacy is protected.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the \"Decoding Broken Hearts\" initiative on \"Special Report.\"",
      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",
      "The MTA says this technology represents the future of subway surveillance and reassures riders that privacy concerns are being taken seriously.",

      "New York City subway (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system. This is intended to protect rider privacy.",

      "Crime trends and government response",
      "Crime in NYC subways has seen ups and downs over recent years. While major crimes dropped by about 7.7% through mid-2024, assaults have unfortunately increased. To bolster safety, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 National Guard members to support transit police efforts. AI technology is viewed as a complementary tool in this broader strategy to keep subways safe, not a standalone solution.",

      "Is AI being used in public transit elsewhere?",
      "New York is not alone in exploring AI for transit security. Cities like Los Angeles and Chicago have experimented with AI-powered cameras for tasks ranging from weapons detection to issuing parking citations. These initiatives reflect a growing interest in using technology to enhance public safety in transit environments.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "While the promise of AI surveillance is encouraging, several questions remain unanswered. We do not yet know exactly which behaviors the system will flag or how effective it will be in practice. Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial. Michael Kemper's extensive experience leading the NYPD's Transit Bureau, where he helped reduce subway crime, adds credibility to the initiative. Still, as this technology rolls out, balancing safety with privacy and fairness will be key to earning public trust.",

      "\"Hamas had significant influence over aid flows, which it used not only for governance but also as leverage to reinforce loyalty, reward patronage networks, and maintain internal control,\" the expert explained. \"The erosion of this influence poses both a symbolic and operational threat to the group.",
      "\"With Hamas becoming sidelined from the aid process, the group is facing a legitimacy crisis,\" Truzman added.",

      "The report also found that nearly half of Palestinian civilians said they had no trust in Hamas' leadership, while roughly a third of the population threw their support behind the group.",

      "\"If this war ends with the Hamas regime that perpetrated October 7th still in power, it won't end, it will just pause, and the next war will be a matter of time,\" Levy said. \"Israelis don\u2019t want war.

      "Levy believes Israel \"found itself stymied along the way\" as countries that initially backed efforts to defeat Hamas \"got cold feet very quickly\" as they understood what removing the terror group from power would entail.",

      "This is not a new or empty threat. Several former hostages reported being threatened and said they were told that their captors would execute them if Israeli forces got close. Six other former hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, met this fate when they were fatally shot just before the IDF could reach them.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 May 2025 22:50:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump pledged to redirect $3 billion from Harvard University to trade schools in a seeming bid for working class support.",
    "story": [
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s war on Harvard University intensifies, he is shifting his message in a seeming bid for new allies \u2014 apart from punishing the institution, he\u2019s also promising to elevate the working class.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump proposed sending $3 billion in research funding cut from Harvard to trade schools across the country. \u201cWhat a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!!\u201d he wrote.",
      "With that money, he told reporters at the White House on Wednesday, \u201cyou can have the best trade schools anywhere in the world.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Trump\u2019s proposal would work, where the money would come from or how it would be distributed. The Trump administration didn\u2019t respond to questions.",
      "But while the plan may be untenable, some education experts say pitting research at the world\u2019s wealthiest university against support for low-cost trade schools is a savvy move.",
      "\u201cPolitically it\u2019s incredibly effective,\u201d said Nat Malkus, deputy director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \u201cHe communicates in a very brief post on Truth Social where his favor lies, and it lies not with the, you know, elite cosmopolitans at Harvard but with everyday Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump has blasted elite colleges for years as out-of-touch institutions that don\u2019t do enough to help students avoid debt, often singling out Harvard, even before the current conflict. More recently, the Trump administration has accused Harvard of failing to address antisemitism and issued a mandate for sweeping reforms in whom the university can admit and hire.",
      "When Harvard refused the demands, the administration cut nearly $3 billion in research funding and attempted to end its ability to host international students.",
      "This week\u2019s push represents a new tactic: trying to build public support by implying that Harvard's success comes at a cost to working Americans.",
      "Most of the federal government\u2019s cuts to Harvard have been to health research, such as studies on cancer and lung disease, which the university has defended as vital. Harvard didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In an NPR interview, Harvard President Alan Garber challenged Trump\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cThe real question is how much value does the federal government get from its expenditures on research,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of actual research demonstrating the returns to the American people have been enormous.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration defended the cuts. \u201cAmerican universities that are committed to their academic mission, protect students on campus, and follow all federal laws will have no problem accessing generous taxpayer support for their programs,\u201d Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the Education Department, said in a statement.",
      "Improving vocational education has been a priority in both Democratic and Republican administrations. Trump has spoken about it in tandem with his quest to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to coordinate a national strategy on career and technical education.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, Education Secretary Linda McMahon emphasized the value of such schools. \u201cOur vocational and skilled-based training is not a default education; it can be front and center so that students who are inclined to go in that direction actually should be encouraged to do that,\u201d she said.",
      "Jerome Grant, CEO of Universal Technical Institute Inc., one of the largest private chains of trade schools, said he has had meetings with Education Department officials about increasing support for vocational education, but not at the expense of other colleges. His concern is less about money, he said, than about helping teens and young adults see the benefits of trade school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in the fray with Harvard or anything \u2014 we don\u2019t have any beef with any four-year schools,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWe just believe that for a lot of kids in America, four-year schools shouldn\u2019t be thought of as their only path after high school.\u201d",
      "The idea that all students should strive for degrees from traditional four-year colleges has given way in recent years amid economic changes and mounting student debt, creating an ascendant bipartisan agreement that other education options should be supported, too.",
      "Trade schools focus on preparing students for certification in specific professions without the general education courses or electives of traditional colleges. So they typically take less time to complete and are less expensive than four-year colleges. Some trade schools are housed at community colleges, largely funded by states and federal student aid.",
      "But many trade schools are also considered for-profit colleges, a sector of higher education that has been scrutinized in the past for failing to deliver on its promises to students.",
      "Education policy experts say the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d that Trump urged House Republicans to pass could weaken regulations of the schools \u2014 and harm working students. As currently drafted, it would roll back regulations that hold career-training programs accountable if their students don\u2019t earn enough after they graduate and expand Pell Grant use to students at shorter-term and unaccredited education programs. It would also limit Pell Grant eligibility for part-time students, many of whom are working-class.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Education Department responded to questions about the provisions.",
      "Jason Altmire, president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, an association that represents private trade schools and for-profit colleges, said his organization welcomes the reforms in the House bill and Trump\u2019s suggestion of pumping more money into trade schools.",
      "Altmire, a former Democratic House member from Pennsylvania, called the Truth Social post a \u201ccontinuation of a lot of good things President Trump has done and said\u201d about the schools he represents. (A former chief policy officer at Altmire\u2019s group has been tapped to become the country\u2019s top higher education official.)",
      "He said that his sector of for-profit schools \u2014 whether they are vocational or degree-awarding \u2014 has been unfairly maligned based on a few extreme examples and that they represent a way forward for many people.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t view it as a zero sum, but I do view it as a changing of the narrative of what\u2019s the priority of this country when it comes to higher education,\u201d he said.",
      "Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, also supports vocational education and questions the need to pit it against schools like Harvard.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a false narrative to say the fact that we\u2019re funding research at these colleges means we\u2019re not funding opportunities for people to have good career education,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth are good goals for us to have.\u201d"

      "The announcement is the latest move in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against U.S. universities and international students in particular, after it revoked thousands of students\u2019 visas, detained or deported other students over political activism and sought to bar international students from enrolling at Harvard University.",
      "Rubio said in a statement that visa criteria would also be revised to \u201cenhance scrutiny\u201d of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,\u201d he said.",
      "China said Thursday that the U.S. was \u201cunjustifiably\u201d canceling Chinese student visas \u201cunder the pretext of ideology and national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis politically discriminatory move exposes the hypocrisy of America\u2019s long-proclaimed values of freedom and openness, and will only further damage the United States\u2019 international image and credibility,\u201d Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "China is the second-biggest source of international students in the United States after India, though numbers have been dropping in recent years amid growing U.S.-China tensions and disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "About 277,000 Chinese students were in the United States in the 2023-24 academic year, down from a peak of more than 370,000 in 2019. By contrast, there were only about 800 Americans studying in China last year, down from a peak of about 15,000 in 2014.",
      "Though Rubio did not specify what he meant by \u201ccritical fields,\u201d both the U.S. and China are concerned about each other\u2019s advancements in strategically sensitive areas such as biotechnology, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.",
      "It is also unclear what Rubio meant by \u201cconnections\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "There were more than 99 million members of the Chinese Communist Party as of the end of 2023, or about 7% of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people, official figures showed. The party also runs the Communist Youth League, which has about 74 million members ages 14 to 28, with some overlap between the two groups.",
      "Up to 75% of university students in the Chinese capital, Beijing, which has the most higher education institutions in the country, apply for party membership during their undergraduate years, according to a paper published in 2016.",
      "Another study in 2014 found that the youngest party members are more likely to report self-interest, such as helping their careers, advancing politically and improving social status, as their reasons for joining.",
      "John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in Chinese politics and governance, said the move to revoke visas for Chinese students showed that the U.S. is \u201cparanoid\u201d about the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "However, the American government has \u201cno independent way\u201d of verifying whether a Chinese student is a party member, unless individual students or people they know reveal it, Burns told NBC News in a phone interview on Thursday.",
      "The best students in China\u2019s elite universities are approached by the party and asked to join, Burns said, and it\u2019s \u201cprobably a wise decision on their part\u201d as the CCP is the \u201cnetwork of all networks\u201d to get ahead in China.",
      "\u201cPragmatism is the order of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cChinese people are not more or less pragmatic, I would say, than anyone else.\u201d",
      "Burns said the loss of students from China or other countries would do \u201chuge damage\u201d to the advancement of science and tech in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey need to be recruiting the best of the best \u2014 wherever they\u2019re from \u2014 not based on some ideological bias,\u201d he said."

      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Republican funding package would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, largely because of the extensions of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts and new expenditures that outweigh the savings.",
      "Musk initially set out to cut upward of $2 trillion through the operation, a goal he later significantly walked back.",
      "Now he leaves the government with DOGE having thus far fallen well short of the trillions of dollars of savings he once touted on the campaign trail. As of Wednesday evening, the DOGE government website claimed $175 billion in savings, though its claims have been found to be questionable.",
      "Trump responded to Musk's criticisms Wednesday afternoon in the Oval Office, defending the funding package. He said the legislation would deliver on several of his key priorities, but he also noted the complexities of passing such a sprawling bill through a sharply divided House.",
      "\u201cMy reaction\u2019s a lot of things. No. 1, we have to get a lot of votes. We can\u2019t be cutting a \u2014 you know \u2014 we need to get a lot of support, and we have a lot of support. We had to get it through the House,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Musk was among the most visible people in the early days of the second Trump administration, securing Trump's favor after having fueled his 2024 presidential campaign with upward of $250 million, according to campaign finance reports.",
      "He was frequently seen alongside Trump, often wearing a Trump hat while appearing with one of his young children. Musk appeared to relish his role as Trump\u2019s waste and fraud czar, taking the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February with a sizable chain saw to tout his cost-cutting initiative.",
      "Musk also at one point threatened to use his wealth to fund challengers to any Republicans who dared to oppose Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "But behind the scenes, tensions between Musk and other Trump administration members mounted, with some of those making their way to the public through news reports about tense meetings and shouting matches. Musk also took some of his grievances public, including criticism of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s public profile suffered \u2014 as did the perception of his most consumer-centric business, Tesla. Public poll numbers showed that he and DOGE were relatively unpopular, and Tesla vehicles and dealerships became the targets of protests and vandalism. Tesla\u2019s stock is down 11% so far this year.",
      "Trump continued to support Musk, at one point in March turning the South Lawn of the White House into an impromptu Tesla showroom and buying one of the vehicles.",
      "Musk\u2019s power, both in terms of his cash contributions as well as his political clout, took a hit in late March when Republicans lost a high-profile judicial election in Wisconsin in which Musk spent heavily and became a target for Democrats.",
      "Musk had maintained that his participation in the Trump administration and DOGE was temporary, but in recent weeks he has signaled that he may pull back from politics more broadly. Over the weekend, he wrote on X that he was \"Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.\" Last week, he said he planned to scale down his sizable spending on politics, though said he would spend in the future if he saw a reason to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t currently see a reason,\u201d he said.",
      "While Musk has said DOGE will continue to operate, it\u2019s unclear just how much pull it will have without him at the helm.",
      "The legacy of the Musk-led effort will most likely be reflected legislatively, as the House is expected to soon put forth a rescissions package to codify DOGE cuts.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure that Congress passes its first rescissions bill, including the DOGE [cuts], and we will send more if they pass it,\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought told Fox Business on Wednesday."

      "But on Wednesday, President Donald Trump commuted the six life sentences that Hoover, a Chicago gang founder, was serving for a 1997 conviction in federal court.",
      "Trump commuted the sentences after a campaign by hip-hop artist Ye, aka Kanye West, now Kim Kardashian\u2019s ex-husband, who has lobbied Trump in the Oval Office to consider releasing Hoover.",
      "Hoover, though, will not be freed. He will be transferred from the federal \u201cSupermax\u201d prison in Colorado, where is held now, to a state prison in Illinois to serve the rest of a 200-year sentence for crimes he was separately convicted of in state court.",
      "Hoover founded the Gangster Disciples, a Chicago-based criminal organization that sold cocaine and other narcotics beginning in the early 1970s.",
      "Called the \u201cchairman of the board\u201d and \u201cthe king\u201d of the gang, he was also declared \u201cone of the most notorious criminals in Illinois history.\u201d Prosecutors have said in court filings that \u201cHoover directed violence and drug trafficking in Chicago from at least 1970 until 1995.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors presented evidence at trial that the Gangster Disciples profited $109 million each year from the sale of narcotics, \u201ca substantial proportion of which went straight to Hoover\u2019s family\u2019s pockets.\u201d",
      "Praise for the commutation",
      "Hoover\u2019s attorneys praised Trump\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThe Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover\u2019s considerable growth and complete rehabilitation,\u201d Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore told CBS News in a statement.",
      "\u201cDespite the Court\u2019s unwillingness to do the right thing, Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters,\" they added. \"Thankfully, Mr. Hoover\u2019s pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover.\u201d",
      "Larry Hoover Jr., Hoover\u2019s son, has called for his father\u2019s release for years and was featured in the 2021 Kanye West song \u201cJesus Lord.\u201d",
      "Hoover has said from prison that he changed the name of his group from \u201cGangster Disciples\u201d to \u201cGrowth and Development.\u201d He said he now discourages violence and has made education mandatory for his followers, pushing inmates to develop job skills they can use after they are released.",
      "Hoover\u2019s family has said he is no longer associated with the Gangster Disciples.",
      "Prosecutors opposed release",
      "But federal prosecutors recently have said Bureau of Prisons intelligence records show that Hoover did not want to be disassociated from the gang.",
      "In September, attorneys for the Justice Department argued in court that \u201cHoover remains the heralded leader of the GDs, despite the intensive monitoring to which he is subject at Florence ADX,\u201d which is the highest-level security prison in the United States and home to convicted terrorists and Ju\u00e1n \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "They strongly urged the court to decline any effort to release Hoover as part of the \u201cFirst Step Act\u201d supported by Kardashian, which Trump signed into law during his first administration.",
      "\u201cHoover has well earned his life sentence, and he is not the type of defendant Congress intended to benefit in enacting the First Step Act,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During the 2108 Oval Office meeting with Trump, Ye urged him to commute Hoover\u2019s sentence.",
      "\u201cThe reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community,\u201d Ye said. \u201cHe started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn\u2019t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around.",
      "\u201cSo there\u2019s theories that there\u2019s infinite amounts of universe and there\u2019s alternate universe,\u201d Ye added. \u201cSo it\u2019s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago.\u201d",
      "After news of the commutation broke Wednesday, Ye posted on X, \u201cWORDS CAN\u2019T EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR OUR DEVOTED ENDURING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FREEING LARRY HOOVER.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "He was one of the richest men of his time, a powerful force in business and then in government \u2014 so influential that political adversaries taunted the White House that he was \u201cthe real president.\u201d",
      "Today, that\u2019s Elon Musk\u2019s story, as the world\u2019s richest man winds down his tumultuous time in Washington as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. But while Musk\u2019s astronomical wealth and the work of his Department of Government Efficiency have been one of a kind, there are strong echoes of another businessman-turned-slasher-of-government who came to Washington just more than 100 years ago.",
      "Andrew Mellon, a Pittsburgh banker and one of America\u2019s wealthiest men in the early 20th century, was treasury secretary to three Republican presidents \u2014 Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover \u2014 for more than a decade in the 1920s and early 1930s.",
      "Like Musk, Mellon came to Washington with the aim of drastically cutting back federal spending. Like Musk, he remained involved in his private businesses at the same time, as biographer David Cannadine has chronicled, sparking fierce protests from opposition Democrats. Like Musk, political opponents made him a national boogeyman and suggested that Mellon was the true power in Washington.",
      "Three presidents served under him, the joke went. Sen. Robert La Follette Sr., a Wisconsin progressive, said Mellon was \u201cthe real president of the United States. Calvin Coolidge is merely the man who occupies the White House.\u201d",
      "And as Musk leaves the White House and appears to consider his political legacy, voicing concern that Trump and Republican lawmakers won\u2019t follow through on his hopes of big spending cuts, Mellon\u2019s own complicated legacy illustrates how difficult even titans of industry have found the task of permanently bending politics and government toward their will.",
      "Mellon achieved his goals for a time, paring back yearly federal spending to approximately half the level it was before he took over the Treasury Department and reforming U.S. tax laws.",
      "But the Great Depression turned the nation sharply against him and the Republican Party personified by wealthy businessmen, with Mellon becoming a political lightning rod in the way Musk has this year.",
      "In \u201cMellon: An American Life,\u201d Cannadine wrote that Mellon\u2019s son recalled witnessing an early exercise in political social media targeting the treasury secretary: a rhyme written on a urinal at a rest stop between Pittsburgh and Washington.",
      "\u201cMellon pulled the whistle, Hoover rang the bell,\u201d it began, \u201cWall Street gave the signal, and the country went to hell.\u201d",
      "When Democrats took back Congress in the backlash after the Depression began, they investigated the intersection of Mellon businesses and government contracts they won while he was in the Cabinet, initiating impeachment proceedings before he resigned to take an ambassadorship.",
      "And ultimately, Mellon saw his low-spending, laissez-faire ethos pushed aside in national politics by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, which ushered in a wave of government spending and social programs that were anathema to Mellon-era Republicans.",
      "No historical comparison lines up neatly in all respects. While Musk and Trump\u2019s administration sought to slash programs through presidential orders and an expansive view of executive power, Mellon worked through Congress to enact his budgetary priorities.",
      "Mellon was fabulously wealthy, thanks to investments in businesses from aluminum to oil to early airlines and beyond,\u00a0but Musk\u2019s businesses and riches are on a significantly different scale. And Mellon\u2019s final work with the government, years later, was also of a decidedly nonpolitical nature: He established the National Gallery of Art, seeding it with his impressive private collection.",
      "Musk\u2019s story is far from its final chapter, with more twists and details to come even as he ends his stint at the White House. What we know for sure, though, is that wealth and power of that magnitude endure through the years.",
      "In a twist of fate, after the Trump administration and DOGE slashed grants and staff this year, the Mellon Foundation, which was launched by Mellon\u2019s children decades ago using part of the family fortune, stepped in to fill $15 million of the gap.",
      "And there\u2019s another eye-popping financial connection between the Mellon years and Musk\u2019s time in government.",
      "Musk was the biggest disclosed donor in the 2024 elections. The second-biggest?  Timothy Mellon, Mellon\u2019s grandson, who gave nearly $200 million in support of Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other causes, according to OpenSecrets \u2014 paving the way for Musk\u2019s stint with DOGE in Washington."

      "Early Thursday morning, Fight Like Hell \u2014 a super PAC affiliated with Whitmer \u2014 distributed internal polling that they said showed that the governor is receiving \"strong marks\" from Michiganders across the political spectrum for her work.",
      "\u201cMichiganders know when their leaders are putting in the work, putting service above self, and getting hard things done, especially when it comes to their pocketbooks. Governor Whitmer has never stopped focusing on bringing good-paying jobs and economic growth to Michigan, and she\u2019s never stopped bringing people together from across the political spectrum to get results. That\u2019s the leadership Michiganders want, and that\u2019s what Governor Whitmer has always done,\" Amanda Stitt, executive director of the PAC, said in a statement on Thursday released alongside the polling."

      "A federal judge on Thursday extended a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's revocation of Harvard's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The extension came after the Trump administration said it would give the university 30 days to challenge the revocation, according to a letter attached to a Wednesday night court filing.",
      "The court document states that the Department of Homeland Security is asking Harvard \"to submit sworn statements and documentary or other evidence to rebut the grounds for withdrawal of certification\" under the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which allows Harvard to enroll foreign students.",
      "That includes misconduct records of its international students and a requirement that the university maintains \"a campus environment free from violence and antisemitism,\" according to the May 28 letter.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students. Hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs temporarily blocked the administration's effort.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted the letter on X on Thursday.",
      "\"Harvard\u2019s refusal to comply with SEVP oversight was the latest evidence that it disdains the American people and takes for granted U.S. taxpayer benefits,\" Noem wrote, referring to the foreign student program. \"Following our letter to Harvard, the school attempted to claim it now wishes to comply with SEVP standards.\"",
      "\"We continue to reject Harvard\u2019s repeated pattern of endangering its students and spreading American hate \u2014 it must change its ways in order to participate in American programs,\" she added.",

      "Burroughs said she would leave the temporary order in place until it can be replaced by a preliminary injunction. No date or timeline was discussed Thursday for when a formal injunction might be issued.",
      "Burroughs' extension of the order came on the deay of the university\u2019s 347th graduation ceremony.",
      "If the revocation is successful, foreign students studying at Harvard will lose their ability to stay in the United States unless they transfer schools. International students make up roughly one-fourth of the university\u2019s student body.",
      "The Trump administration is also battling the nation\u2019s oldest \u2014 and arguably most prestigious \u2014 university in court over the funding from the federal government that gives Harvard the ability to conduct state-of-the-art research. Last month, the administration stripped Harvard of $2 billion in federal research grants, prompting Harvard to sue.",
      "On Monday, Trump said on his social media website, Truth Social, that he was considering taking $3 billion in grant money away from Harvard and giving it to trade schools instead.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber, in an interview Tuesday with NPR, said he was \"less concerned about whether it goes to a trade school or if it goes to some other project, like working on highways.\"",
      "\"What the real question is, how much value does the federal government get from its expenditures on research?\" Garber said.",
      "The legal battles came shortly after Harvard refused to comply with a list of sweeping demands from the Trump administration\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism last month.",
      "The task force wanted to oversee who Harvard admits and hires and subject its faculty to a government audit.",
      "The confrontation with Harvard is among the Trump administration's broader efforts to determine who has access to higher education in the U.S.",
      "On Tuesday, the administration stopped scheduling new interviews for international students seeking visas to study in the U.S., according to an internal cable seen by NBC News. The State Department will also expand its screening of visa applicants' social media use, according to the cable."

    "story": [
      "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 When Utah Republicans passed a ban on gender-affirming health care for children and teens in 2023, they argued it was needed to protect vulnerable kids from treatments that could cause long-term harm.",
      "Years later, the results of a study commissioned under the same law contradict that claim, and the Republican-led Legislature is facing pressure to reconsider the restrictions.",
      "Utah's Department of Health and Human Services and experts from the state's leading health organizations concluded from a study of thousands of transgender people that gender-affirming care generated \"positive mental health and psychosocial functioning outcomes.\"",
      "Policies that prevent access to hormone therapy for minors cannot be justified based on scientific findings or concerns about potential regret in the future, the report states.",
      "The agency is not taking a position on whether lawmakers should lift the statewide ban on hormone therapy and surgeries for minors. But it reminded lawmakers that they had intended for the prohibition to be temporary until the state could conduct its own research.",
      "Utah is among 27 states that have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, who Republican politicians have made a political lightning rod. Federal judges have struck down bans in Arkansas, Florida and Montana as unconstitutional, though a federal appeals court has stayed the Florida ruling. The law in Kansas is not yet being enforced.",
      "Some Utah Republicans said they were open to considering the findings of the study, while others were quick to dismiss it.",
      "In a joint statement, the House sponsor of the 2023 law banning gender-affirming care and the chair of the Legislature's interim health committee said they \"intend to keep the moratorium in place.\"",
      "\"Young kids and teenagers should not be making life-altering medical decisions based on weak evidence,\" said Republican Reps. Katy Hall and Bridger Bolinder. \"Simply put, the science isn't there, the risks are real, and the public is with us.\"",
      "All major medical organizations in the U.S. consider gender-affirming care to be safe, effective and medically necessary for transgender youth. But polling shows that Republicans' restrictions on transgender kids' access to care resonate with voters, according to a recent survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Senate President Stuart Adams said he is committed to reviewing the report. The Republican leader has suggested previously that children and teens are too young to consent to the treatments.",
      "Children questioning their gender identity generally receive counseling and may be prescribed puberty-blocking drugs or hormones. Gender-affirming surgeries, such as operations to transform the chest or genitals, are rarely performed on minors.",
      "\"The future and safety of kids are paramount,\" Adams said. \"That is why Utah enacted a law to safeguard the long-term health and well-being of minors while providing time to carefully examine the evolving medical landscape surrounding novel and irreversible procedures for minors. I appreciate the Utah Department of Health and Human Services for evaluating the available evidence.\"",
      "Utah Democratic leaders Rep. Angela Romero and Sen. Luz Escamilla are urging their Republican colleagues to take more time to review the more than 1,000-page report before deciding the future of the ban.",
      "Under the law, children who had already been diagnosed with gender dysphoria before January 2023 were allowed to continue receiving hormones. The University of Utah shut down its health clinic for LGBTQ+ youth earlier this month after the law significantly decreased its number of patients. Doctors who provide gender-affirming care to minors in violation of the ban could lose their licenses and face criminal charges.",
      "The report prepared for lawmakers acknowledged certain risks associated with gender-affirming care, including an increase in some types of benign brain tumors. But experts highlighted the positive impact of such treatments in mitigating the risk of suicide among transgender youth.",
      "\"Patients that were seen at the gender clinic before the age of 18 had a lower risk of suicide compared to those referred as an adult,\" the report states. \"When left untreated, individuals with gender dysphoria may experience psychological and social harms.\"",
      "The report in Utah contrasts with one issued earlier this month by President Donald Trump's administration that questioned widely accepted treatment standards from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not release information about who authored the report, and major medical groups said they were not consulted.",
      "Trump's guidance urges greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than medical interventions for children who experience a disconnect between their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. It follows an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19."

      "\u201cWhile the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died. Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could allow it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.",
      "Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine\u2019s efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In a win for business interests that chafe at burdensome environmental studies, the Supreme Court on Thursday gave a boost to a planned 88-mile railroad project that would transport crude oil in Utah.",
      "The court ruled in favor of an alliance of local counties that support the project, called the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, concluding that the federal environmental review process did not have to consider potential broader, indirect impacts.",
      "The conservative-majority court was unanimous on the bottom line, although the three liberal justices differed on the reasoning. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case.",
      "The court ruled that consideration of broader downstream impacts of the project were not required under a federal law called the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court, said some federal judges have incorrectly applied NEPA and allowed it to be used as a broad weapon to challenge major development projects.",
      "\"NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents ... to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,\" he wrote.",

      "Although the coalition won at the Supreme Court, the project still has to undergo further review by the federal Surface Transportation Board before it can move forward.",
      "The railroad would bring oil from the Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah by connecting the area to the national rail network.",
      "The opposition to the project was led by Eagle County, Colorado, which claims it will suffer from downstream effects of the railroad, and several environmental groups.",
      "The county's lawyers said it would be directly affected by the project, with 9 out of every 10 trains that use the new railroad eventually passing through it on an existing line that runs along the Colorado River.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board conducted an environmental review and gave the railroad the green light to move forward.",

    "story": [
      "A federal court ruling striking down some of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs has injected a fresh bout of uncertainty into markets, with U.S. stocks in mixed territory Thursday.",
      "In early trading, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq all showed modest gains. Bond yields fell.",
      "A federal three-judge panel on Wednesday ruled against Trump\u2019s 10% blanket tariffs and 20% fentanyl tariffs on China, stating that he had exceeded his constitutional authority.",
      "The permanent injunction has the effect of lowering the U.S.'s average effective tariff rate from 15% to 6.5%, according to Capital Economics consultancy. The ruling did not affect import duties on automobiles, auto parts, and steel and aluminum.",
      "Even as markets cheered the elimination of some import taxes, experts said the court decision ultimately adds another layer of uncertainty to Trump's trade-war effort. The administration immediately filed an appeal that is likely to wind up in the Supreme Court, though the timetable was not clear.",
      "In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts said despite the increased uncertainty sparked by the ruling, it \"might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners.\"",
      "The administration may seek to quickly replace the 10% tariff \"with a similar tariff of up to 15%\" under a different U.S. statute, they wrote, while it works to tap another statute to reimpose duties against larger trading partners.",
      "Even if the nation's highest court were to rule against Trump's tariffs in their current form, \"it would be unlikely to mark the end of the tariff war given the various other routes through which the Trump administration could impose tariffs,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a note to clients.",
      "The investment bank UBS warned clients that \"significant policy uncertainty remains.\" Even if the struck-down tariffs do not come back, they wrote, \"at least some of the economic impact has likely already begun to take effect.\"",
      "Analysts with Citi noted the ruling is likely to derail the administration's ongoing trade discussions.",
      "\"The administration is likely to either successfully appeal the ruling or to use other authority ... to keep tariff rates high and revenue substantial,\" they said in a note. \"For now, the ruling will complicate and potentially delay trade negotiations.\"",
      "Trump administration officials said that they were considering alternative ways of reimposing the affected tariffs, but that they were confident their original directives would be reinstated.",
      "\"We're going to see what happens on appeal, and we're very confident in our success there,\" National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business. \"But the fact is that there are things, measures ... that we could start right now.\"",
      "\"But we're not planning to pursue those right now because we're very, very confident that this really is incorrect,\" Hassett added.",
      "Meanwhile, computer chipmaker Nvidia reported that its quarterly revenues had climbed 70%, beating Wall Street estimates. With its chips powering much of the artificial intelligence revolution, Nvidia is now seen as a bellwether for the health of the tech sector and indeed much of the economy as businesses look to incorporate AI into their operations.",
      "As a result, its performance has become tightly correlated to that of the broader market. Nvidia shares were up as much as 5% in pre-market trading."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The sky was apparently not the limit for a Chinese paraglider who climbed to a near record-breaking altitude of more than 28,000 feet Wednesday.",
      "The only problem? He hadn't even intended to fly.",
      "In what acrophobes \u2014 those with a fear of heights \u2014 could only imagine in their worst nightmares, 55-year-old Peng Yujian was just conducting a routine equipment test in the northern province of Gansu when a powerful updraft lifted him off the ground.",
      "\u201cI had just bought a secondhand paragliding harness and wanted to test it. So I was conducting ground parachute shaking,\u201d Peng told state-run broadcaster CCTV News on Wednesday. \u201cThe wind suddenly picked up and lifted me into the air.\u201d",
      "\u201cI tried to land as soon as possible, but I failed,\u201d he added, explaining that he was then carried even higher by a wind and ended up trapped in the cloud system, ascending as high as 5 miles above the ground to heights usually the preserve of commercial airliners.",
      "According to a statement from the Aero Sports Association of Gansu Province, Peng is a licensed paraglider with two years of experience that appeared to come in handy on the video captured by a camera attached to his equipment.",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the footage, released by CCTV, which showed Peng\u2019s face and gear coated in ice as he said: \u201cI can\u2019t get out now. I\u2019m totally lost.\u201d",
      "Peng said he started to panic when he reached the cloud base.",
      "\u201cEverything ahead [was] a vast expanse of whiteness,\u201d he told CCTV, adding that he had no directional awareness without a compass.",
      "Even with a compass, it would have been too difficult to maintain direction because of poor visibility inside the clouds, Peng said. \u201cI thought I was flying straight, but in fact, I kept spinning around.\u201d",
      "Peng said the scariest moment of his ordeal was when his parachute plunged headfirst toward the earth. But he managed to right himself before emerging from the cloud system heading northeast.",
      "\u201cI looked around and thought: \u2018Ah, I\u2019m saved this time!\u201d he said.",
      "In the Aero Sports Association statement, Peng, who was not wearing an oxygen mask, said that he gasped for air after landing and that he might have lost consciousness for about three minutes due to hypoxia and low temperatures.",
      "Peng's adventure almost saw him break the world record, itself also set accidentally in 2007 when a German paraglider was encased in ice after being sucked into a tornadolike thunderstorm in Australia and carried to a height greater than Mount Everest.",
      "Along with another pilot who published the video \u201cwithout permission,\u201d Peng was initially handed a six-month flight suspension, Chinese air sports authorities said.",
      "Under China\u2019s national paragliding regulations, pilots are required to have a valid license issued by the Aero Sports Federation of China, and a flight plan must be approved before any activity. Individuals who violate the rules are penalized based on the seriousness of the incident.",
      "But the ban sparked a backlash on Chinese social media.",
      "\u201cHe barely made it out alive. It\u2019s not like he wanted to fly that high,\u201d one user wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "While local media reported that the association withdrew the statement the same day, it is unclear whether Peng's suspension is still in place.",
      "Peng said the swelling in his body has \u201cgone down a lot,\u201d but that his hands and face still felt numb.",
      "\u201cMy fear hasn\u2019t completely faded,\u201d Peng told CCTV News. \u201cI still feel uneasy when I think about it now.\u201d",
      "He said he decided to \u201ctake a break\u201d from flying for the moment."

    "summary": "Major League Baseball is investing in Athletes Unlimited to support its softball league that will debut next month, marking the first time MLB will have a comprehensive partnership with a professional women's sports league.",
    "story": [
      "Major League Baseball is investing in Athletes Unlimited to support its softball league that will debut next month, marking the first time MLB will have a comprehensive partnership with a professional women's sports league.",
      "MLB said Thursday it was making a strategic investment in the Athletes Unlimited Softball League of an undisclosed amount for operational costs and a commitment to help it gain visibility in various ways, including assistance with content, marketing and sales, events, distribution, editorial, and digital and social platforms. That includes marketing the AUSL and its athletes during MLB's All-Star Game and throughout the postseason.",
      "\"This is something we're really excited about,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told The Associated Press. \"We studied the space hard. We think it's a real opportunity and we're excited to be involved.\"",
      "Athletes Unlimited has featured softball since 2020, when it unveiled a unique format that crowned an individual champion. The company will launch a league with a traditional, team-based format starting June 7 and will keep its individual format for the AUSL All-Star Cup that follows.",
      "Manfred noted that interest in women's sports had \"escalated significantly\" in recent years and his league had been looking for ways to get more involved, including the possible launch of its own softball league. He said Athletes Unlimited's overall success and its strong infrastructure helped make the decision to collaborate easier.",
      "\"We thought rather than starting on our own and competing, that finding a place where we could invest and grow a business was a better opportunity for us,\" Manfred said.",
      "Kim Ng, a former Major League Baseball executive, signed on as an adviser with the AUSL and was promoted to commissioner in April. Ng is the former general manager of the Miami Marlins, the first female GM in any of the major U.S. pro sports leagues, and has three World Series rings from a combined 21 years in the front offices of the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\"As the process moved forward and it looked like we were going to make an investment, they hired Kim, and we had a long relationship with Kim, and it just added additional comfort to the idea of making the investment,\" Manfred said.",
      "Athletes Unlimited co-founder Jon Patricof said MLB's commitment to increasing the AUSL's visibility is as important as the financial investment.",
      "\"They're committed to really elevating the AUSL,\" he said. \"It's probably about one of the most difficult things for any sports league to do which is to get visibility and break through to new audiences, and I think MLB is already doing that for the AUSL, and there's going to be a lot more to come.\"",
      "Women's pro softball leagues and independent teams have come and gone over the years, but none have offered a consistent option for women to have a stable future in the sport.",
      "It appears that might change, with the help of softball greats Cat Osterman, Jennie Finch, Jessica Mendoza and Natasha Watley as AUSL advisors. On June 7, the Bandits and Talons will open with a three-game series in Rosemont, Illinois, and the Blaze and Volts will start off with a three-game series in Wichita, Kansas. The four teams will play 24 games this season as touring properties that will play games in 12 cities. The top two teams will compete in the AUSL Championship, a best-of-three series July 26-28 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.",
      "Patricof said the league plans to expand to six teams next season and be city based.",
      "MLB already supports several women's softball and baseball initiatives, including a partnership with USA Softball and operation of the MLB Develops girls baseball pipeline. It is not involved with the upstart Women's Professional Baseball League, which plans to launch in 2026 as the first pro baseball league for women since the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League \u2014 of \"A League of Their Own\" fame \u2014 folded in 1954.",
      "Manfred said he sees a bright future ahead for AUSL.",
      "\"I fully expect that they will expand, and we hope that we will end up with a league that is sustainable on its own, a good investment for us, and a partner in growing diamond sports internationally,\" he said.",
      "Patricof said the partnership with MLB and the already existing relationship between the Athletes Unlimited and USA Softball combine to help give the AUSL stability.",
      "\"As we announce MLB coming into the fold formally into what we're doing with the AUSL, you really see a full alignment of this sport behind this league, and that I think is exciting for everyone,\" Patricof said. \"People who have sat on the sidelines or maybe have watched pro softball from a little bit of distance \u2014 everybody's now jumped in, and I think that is an exciting moment for people who've been around this sport.\""

      "A video shared by White House aide Margo Martin on X showed Trump calling the pair's children, saying, \u201cYour parents are going to be free and clear and I hope we can do it by tomorrow.\u201d",

      "Why were Todd and Julie Chrisley in prison?",

      "In 2022, the couple was found guilty of federal fraud charges and hiding their wealth from tax authorities. Months later, Todd Chrisley was sentenced to serve 12 years at Federal Prison Camp Pensacola, Florida, while Julie Chrisley was given a seven-year sentence at the Federal Medical Center Lexington in Kentucky.",

      "As of September 2023, Todd Chrisley was set to be released on Jan. 22, 2033, two years less than his original sentence. Julie Chrisley's sentence was reduced by 14 months, changing her release date to Oct. 19. 2028.",
      "Julie Chrisley's sentence was entirely thrown out in June 2024, when judges in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge from the original trial miscalculated her prison term.This vacated her sentence, prompting a lower court to resentence the reality television star.",
      "During the resentencing hearing in September 2024, a judge subsequently declined to reduce Julie Chrisley's prison sentence. Instead, she was resentenced to 84 months (seven years) in prison and five years of supervised release. She was thus expected to be released on April 22, 2028 prior to the pardon."

      "White originally competed on \"Survivor\" Season 37, \"David vs. Goliath,\" which aired in the fall of 2018.",
      "Inspired by the Biblical story, Season 37 split castaways into two tribes: the \u201cDavids,\" or underdogs, and \u201cGoliaths,\" or people perceived as successful in society.

      "Besides his relatable lines, White was a stellar competitor, proving his love for the game through strong social moves. After initially aiming to appear non-threatening, toward the end of the season, he went on the offensive, organizing multiple blindsides, including the eliminations of Davie Rickenbacker, Gabby Pascuzzi and Hubicki.",
      "White then had to compete in a fire-making challenge to make it to the final three. He successfully beat Kara Kay, winning a spot in the finale, alongside original David tribe member Nick Wilson and fellow Goliath Keeley.",
      "During the Final Tribal Council, White made his case for winning, claiming he purposefully tried to appear weak at the beginning before attacking at the end, while maintaining a strong social game throughout.",
      "However, he did not win Season 37. Wilson won with seven votes, and White came in second after receiving three.",
      "What has Mike White said about his time on 'Survivor'?",
      "Fans of White shouldn't be shocked by his return. After all, he's never been shy about his love for the game, even shouting out the show in one of his Emmy acceptance speeches in 2022.",
      "\u201cI just want to say, I was on 'Survivor,' and on 'Survivor,' the way to stay in the game is you lower your threat level,\u201d he said while accepting the Emmy for writing for a limited or anthology series or movie. \u201cNow, I feel like I\u2019ve raised my threat level. I just want to stay in the game. Awards are great. I love writing. I love doing what I do. Don\u2019t come for me. Don\u2019t vote me off the island, please!\u201d",
      "In 2018, he told IndieWire that he actually begged the \"Survivor\" producers for years for a chance to be on the show.",
      "\"The truth is I was a 'Survivor' fanatic from the beginning,\" he said at the time. \"'The Amazing Race' always looked more fun to me, you\u2019re traveling. 'Survivor,' in a way, is a more fun show to watch, but it looked like it would be more hellish to do. However, after watching around 35 seasons, my philosophy is, don\u2019t just be a spectator \u2014 be a participant. It took a while for me to convince them. But I was down to do it for years.\"",
      "After coming in second, White told Entertainment Weekly that he was \"happy\" with his results. He said that he \"did want to win\" and he \"played to win,\" but during the finale, he realized others may have had better reasons for winning and believed \"it all worked out for the best.\""

      "\u201cI love love love her, but you should\u2019ve stopped that wig,\u201d one person wrote about Montag's coiffed hair, spurring Pratt to clap back, while also plugging Montag\u2019s upcoming album, \u201cHeidiwood.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnly 3 days if you love her buy the \u2018Heidiwood\u2019 album so she can afford better wigs in the future. Fancy wigs cost like 20k ask Beyonc\u00e8,\u201d he wrote May 27 on TikTok.",
      "Pratt also fired back to the wig comment with his own dig on Instagram.",
      "\u201cfor the wig haters please pre order HEIDIWOOD now so that future wigs have more budget,\u201d he wrote May 27 on Instagram.",
      "While some fans criticized Montag's fitted hairdo, saying it was \"bad\" and \"I didn't love it,\" some came to her support in the comments section on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI liked it!!! Thought it was a nice change, mixed up her look! People need to be quiet,\u201d one supportive fan wrote on TikTok.",

      "\u201cit looked good with the fit,\u201d someone else wrote.",
      "In another TikTok video, Pratt continued to address the online chatter about his wife's wig, noting that amid those who hated and \"loved\" his wife's hairstyle, the couple were still very \"thankful\" to be at the star-studded event and be a topic of conversation.",
      "\u201cA lot of people loved the wig. A lot of people didn\u2019t love it so much. But you know what, we\u2019re very thankful to be at the American Music Awards and having anyone talking about Heidi\u2019s hair,\u201d he began. \u201cWhat a blessing.",
      "\u201cSo, you know (in) the future, if Heidi, were to do another wig, hopefully we\u2019ll have Beyonc\u00e8 money one day, because I\u2019ve learned a lot about wigs,\" he continued. \"A really nice wig is $20,000. We don\u2019t have a $20,000 wig budget, so it\u2019s a cute little wig for the money that we can afford for a wig.\u201d",
      "Pratt also said his wife\u2019s hair was meant to get some attention, while again asking people to purchase Montag\u2019s upcoming album.",
      "\u201cIt was just supposed to be a fun little, \u2018Oh, look at the wig!\u2019 And it worked, I guess,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut, you know, I\u2019m so thankful so many people care so much about Heidi that they wanted her to look the best she possibly can on the red carpet. A lot of people even love the wig, so it\u2019s all good. All that really matters, if you want us to get new wigs for Heidi in the future, please pre-order \u2018Heidiwood\u2019 right now so that we can afford one. So, thank you for caring.\u201d",
      "Montag also addressed her change of hairstyle, saying it was nothing more than a chance to add some pizazz for a short time.",
      "\u201cWe just thought switch it up a little bit and keep it fresh. I\u2019ve never done this so it\u2019s very exciting, and just a moment,\u201d she told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d on the red carpet of the AMAs.",
      "When asked if her hair would once again be long the next day, Montag had a simple response",
      "\u201cMagically,\u201d she said."

      "In her new memoir, \u201cMaybe This Will Save Me,\u201d the actor, 33, recalled how the relationship started. Flynn, one night, hosted the cast of the Netflix show at his place. While others were \u201ccasually drinking,\u201d Dorfman said she opted to smoke a cigarette on the balcony.",
      "\u201cWithin a few puffs, I looked over to find that Brandon had joined me,\u201d Dorfman wrote. \u201cHis boyish tipsy charm was intoxicating, he carried confidence with ease, and his blue eyes sparkled, perhaps this is what people meant when they said star quality. Whatever it was, Brandon embodied it.\u201d",
      "Dorfman then described feeling an \u201cundeniable charge between us when we locked eyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe held each other\u2019s gaze for what felt like forever, and next thing I knew, we were up in his bedroom, ripping each other\u2019s clothes off,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was lusty and fun in the most beautiful, magical of ways.\u201d",
      "The co-stars \u201cenjoyed a short lived romance\u201d over the course of a \u201cfew days,\u201d Dorfman wrote, explaining that Flynn \u201cwas open to something more serious.\u201d",
      "\"...I couldn't offer anything more than casual fun so eventually, he called it off,\" Dorfman wrote.",
      "Though noting the breakup was \u201cfor the best,\u201d as she \u201cneeded to focus on my work,\u201d Flynn soon after began dating their fellow co-star, Miles Heizer. At this point, Dorfman admitted she wondered at the time if she \u201cmade a terrible mistake.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeeing Miles and Brandon so in love sparked an unexpected jealousy in me, a yearning for that excitement and fire, perhaps even more serious feelings lingered for Brandon at that time, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy bed was made, and I needed to focus on the task at hand: memorizing my lines.\u201d",
      "Flynn's reps did not immediately responded to TODAY.com's request for comment.",
      "Up until the release of the actor's new memoir, which was published May 27, neither Dorfman nor Flynn had confirmed romantic involvement. In 2017, Heizer's rep denied dating rumors between him and Flynn to Page Six.",
      "\u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d aired for four seasons from 2017 to 2020. Dorfman played the role of Ryan Shaver, while Flynn played Justin Foley and Heizer starred as Alex Standall.",
      "Dorfman came out as transgender in a 2021 interview with Time and kept her first name.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m named after my mom\u2019s brother who passed a month after I was born, and I feel very connected to that name, to an uncle who held me as he was dying. This is an evolution of Tommy. I\u2019m becoming more Tommy,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Manolo Caro and Cecilia Su\u00e1rez talk about working together on their new Netflix series, \"Serpientes y Escaleras.\"",
    "story": [
      "There\u2019s a tweet that caught Mexican filmmaker Manolo Caro\u2019s attention that reads: \u201cEstoy m\u00e1s tranquilo que Cecilia Su\u00e1rez en un casting de Manolo Caro.\u201d",
      "The Spanish-language sentence hilariously translates to: \u201cI\u2019m calmer than Cecilia Su\u00e1rez at a Manolo Caro casting.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want the creator of that tweet \u2014 because we have yet to get in contact with them \u2014 to make themself known because that tweet has been mentioned to me so many times,\u201d Caro, in Spanish, tells TODAY.com. \u201cI would love to thank them and send them my warmest regards.\u201d",
      "Caro and renowned Mexican star Cecilia Su\u00e1rez have a creative partnership that spans almost two decades. The longtime friends and collaborators have worked on more than six projects together, including Caro\u2019s first short film \u201cGente Bien... Atascada\u201d (2007), his debut feature film \u201cNo S\u00e9 Si Cortarme Las Venas O Dej\u00e1rmelas Largas\u201d (2013), the Netflix series \u201cCasa de las Flores\u201d (2018) and their latest series, \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras,\u201d which translates to \u201cSnakes and Ladders.\u201d",
      "Loved and adored by their Latin fans and community, the two share with TODAY.com what makes their professional and personal relationship thrive \u2014 and why Caro doesn't feel the need to work with anyone else.",
      "\u201cWhen good things happen, you have to take advantage of them,\u201d Caro says of his working relationship with Su\u00e1rez. \u201cI believe when there\u2019s magic... (someone) being there for you in your personal and professional life, that\u2019s something to be applauded.\u201d",
      "He continues, \u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you think of someone else?\u2019 I say, \u2018But why should I chose someone else?\u2019\u201d",
      "Their latest comedy, \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras,\u201d follows Su\u00e1rez as Dora, the rigid yet determined prefect of a prestigious school. At first glance, she\u2019s a seemingly insignificant employee. But when she gets caught up in a family quarrel between two 8-year-old students and their pompous parents, it jeopardizes her lifelong dream of becoming school principal.",
      "\u201cI have the liberty of casting who I want to because I write the stories,\u201d Caro candidly says. \u201cAnd I have the privilege and am fortunate to have lifelong friends who I think are excellent performers.\u201d",
      "When asked why they work so well together, the two turn their heads towards each other and laugh.",
      "\u201cWho knows?\u201d says Su\u00e1rez, with Caro quipping, \u201cKarma. We must\u2019ve done something good in another life.\u201d",
      "Su\u00e1rez elaborates that whatever universe Caro creates, there is a clear understanding of their wants and needs on both sides.",
      "\u201cAnd then there\u2019s also a lot of confidence and the desire to take risks. And risks together, which makes you push yourself  a little further because when you do that with someone else,\u201d she says, \u201csiempre es lindo,\u201d which translates to, \u201cthat\u2019s always nice.\u201d",
      "The risk they take with \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras\u201d is asking people about their relationship and views on power, ambition and \u201cto what extent we are willing to go outside our ethical and moral frameworks.\u201d The title refers to people having the ability to be snakes climbing the ladder.",
      "\u201cEach person has different concepts of morality,\u201d Caro says, not just in life but on the show. \u201cPut that concept on the table, it starts a conversation \u2014 and that\u2019s what entertainment is about.\u201d",
      "When it comes to Su\u00e1rez's character, Dora, she is faced with having to keep the secrets of very powerful and very important figures. Using their actions and lies against them would put her life at risk \u2014 but it would also help her get her dream job.",
      "When Dora gets to a crossroad in her life, she faces a dilemma of doing what is right or what will benefit her.",
      "\u201cWhen she makes that decision,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says, \u201cIt brings a slew of changes in her personal and professional life and her family. It affects everything in her path and evidently changes and transforms her life and surroundings.\u201d",
      "While the show may deal with heavy topics about ethics and morals, the entertaining and choreographed title sequence is a great example of Caro\u2019s signature comical and creative touch. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s involvement is the cherry on top.",
      "\u201cIt sets the tone for the series,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see the sequence in the first minutes of the show, one thinks, \u2018Well, now anything can happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "And that's just what fans expect from Caro and Su\u00e1rez's relationship."

      "Just like the rest of the world, it seems like Netflix is equally as obsessed with Formula 1.",
      "From the streamer's incredibly successful seven season docuseries \"Drive to Survive\" to a documentary about rookie Kimi Antonelli, Netflix has been showcasing all the F1 action.",
      "Now, a new docuseries called \"F1: The Academy\" from Hello Sunshine \u2014 Reese Witherspoon\u2019s production company \u2014 is hitting the streaming giant, this time, highlighting women in motorsport.",
      "What is 'F1: The Academy' about?",

The F1 Academy aims to highlight women in racing and give them the chance to advance to higher levels of motorsport with the ultimate goal of getting a woman on the F1 grid.",
      "After all, women are allowed to compete in F1, yet it's been nearly 50 years since a woman has officially held an F1 seat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d F1 Academy driver Abbi Pulling previously told TODAY.com. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing more young girls get into go-karting.\u201d",
      "The docuseries follows Wolff and the Academy drivers through their 2024 season as they battle for equality within the sport, fight one other for the championship and face the mounting pressure that comes with the spotlight.",
      "\u201cI want to continue to be bold, to disrupt and to show the next generation, and all those who are fans of the sport, that the sport you love is a place where women cannot just be involved but also thrive,\u201d Susie Wolff previously told TODAY.com.",
      "Ahead of the docuseries release, Pulling tells TODAY.com that the docuseries will be a little different from \u201cDrive to Survive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think when you see \u2018Driver to Survive,\u2019 (the F1 drivers are) at their pinnacle of the sport,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re in Formula 1. They\u2019re already established racing drivers. Whereas we\u2019re on that journey, we\u2019re on that progression path, and we\u2019re fighting to prove why we deserve to move up the ladder, one step closer to Formula 1.\u201d",
      "But just like \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d the drivers\u2019 personal lives are explored throughout the docuseries. Bianca Bustamante, another Academy driver featured in the show, tells TODAY.com that this aspect was challenging at times.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a level of closeness that you don\u2019t let other people get to, but the whole world will have access to that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd somehow it\u2019s so vulnerable and so raw and so real.\u201d",
      "She adds that the show captures \u201cyour highest of highs or lowest of lows\u201d and hopes that people understand \u201cthe tears that were shed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey were very real,\u201d Bustamante says. \u201cAnd the emotions and the pain \u2014 I hope that people feel those emotions as strongly as I did in the moment because I\u2019ve always worn my heart on my sleeves.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe really are following the drivers\u2019 journey so what\u2019s pivotal presents itself to us, and then we react to it and make sure we tell the story appropriately,\u201d docuseries executive producer Sara Rea previously told TODAY.com. \u201cHighs and lows and everything in between.\u201d",
      "What time will \u2018F1: The Academy\u2019 be streaming?",

      "How many episodes will \u2018F1: The Academy' have?",
      "The docuseries will have seven episodes.",
      "What do the drivers hope people take away from the docuseries?",
      "Pulling tells TODAY.com ahead of the docuseries' premiere that she hopes it shows the truth behind the hard work the women and teams put in to get where they are today.",
      "She says she knows there are some people who will \u201cnever change their viewpoint\u201d on believing women are inferior in racing. But since the Academy\u2019s inception, she thinks a lot of people are starting to see and believe in women\u2019s potential in motorsport.",
      "\u201cI think people are believing in us a lot more. . . We\u2019ve been welcomed with open arms and respected,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople realize ... we can race hard and fast.\u201d",
      "While being in front of the camera can be \u201cquite a scary place\u201d for some of the drivers, Pulling says it shows the reality of what goes on and off the grid.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making mistakes. We\u2019re still at parts of our career where the F1 drivers were making mistakes, but they didn\u2019t have a show made about it and they weren\u2019t as watched as closely,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite intimidating in that aspect, as it\u2019s a lot, but I think it will only help in showing breaking that stigma and seeing the work we\u2019re putting in off the track,\u201d she adds.",
      "Bustamante hopes that the series \u201cresonates\u201d with fans.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few of us featured in the storyline, all different drivers with all different histories and trajectories and all in different stages of our lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hope (viewers) find someone they resonate with \u2014 whether it be a hero story of them coming from this or that, experiencing the same issues in life \u2014 and they take away a lesson of some sort from our experiences. And not just that, but to also champion the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about passing the torch a little bit brighter, to give them a bit more insight,\u201d she adds, noting that they are all still rookies trying to make a name for themselves."

      "This isn't the first time Parton has partnered with Conagra to bring her go-to recipes to her fans. Since 2022, the singer has worked with Duncan Hines, which is owned by Conagra, to create custom cake mixes, frosting, brownies, biscuits, pancakes and muffins, among other Southern-style classics.",
      "In September, Parton released a cookbook, \u201cGood Lookin\u2019 Cookin\u2019,\u201d with her sister, Rachel Parton George. The siblings shared \u201ca year of meals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cThese are just rich and hearty, and just got all the seasoning in the world. We just wanted to have things that would be easy to freeze, easy to serve and really stay tasty.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hate bland frozen foods. So this is not bland,\u201d Parton continues, explaining that she was involved in the tasting process, instructing the kitchen to add \u201ca little more butter or a little more salt or a little more pepper\u201d where needed.",
      "Unlike other frozen meal options that are \u201cnot something you want to eat every day,\u201d her dishes are \u201cthe kind of stuff you crave.\u201d",

      "He added it was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and public parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",

      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",

      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",

    "story": [
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles III outlined new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s government priorities at the country's Parliament on Tuesday in what is being seen as a show of support in the face of President Donald Trump's threats to annex America's neighbor.",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",

      "A downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d",

      "The only problem? He hadn't even intended to fly.",
      "In what acrophobes \u2014 those with a fear of heights \u2014 could only imagine in their worst nightmares, 55-year-old Peng Yujian was just conducting a routine equipment test in the northern province of Gansu when a powerful updraft lifted him off the ground.",
      "\u201cI had just bought a secondhand paragliding harness and wanted to test it. So I was conducting ground parachute shaking,\u201d Peng told state-run broadcaster CCTV News on Wednesday. \u201cThe wind suddenly picked up and lifted me into the air.\u201d",
      "\u201cI tried to land as soon as possible, but I failed,\u201d he added, explaining that he was then carried even higher by a wind and ended up trapped in the cloud system, ascending as high as 5 miles above the ground to heights usually the preserve of commercial airliners.",
      "According to a statement from the Aero Sports Association of Gansu Province, Peng is a licensed paraglider with two years of experience that appeared to come in handy on the video captured by a camera attached to his equipment.",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the footage, released by CCTV, which showed Peng\u2019s face and gear coated in ice as he said: \u201cI can\u2019t get out now. I\u2019m totally lost.\u201d",
      "Peng said he started to panic when he reached the cloud base.",
      "\u201cEverything ahead [was] a vast expanse of whiteness,\u201d he told CCTV, adding that he had no directional awareness without a compass.",
      "Even with a compass, it would have been too difficult to maintain direction because of poor visibility inside the clouds, Peng said. \u201cI thought I was flying straight, but in fact, I kept spinning around.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has emerged as a staunch defender of Alternative for Germany, a political party with Nazi echoes that has risen in popularity \u2014 and that German intelligence officials recently classified as a \u201cproven right-wing extremist organization.\u201d",
      "The party is known by its German initialism, AfD, and it has included leaders who have embraced old Nazi slogans and minimized the atrocities of Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.",
      "Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticized the German government\u2019s efforts to isolate and investigate AfD, arguing that such actions amount to undemocratic persecution of a rival political group.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that a particular set of views is gross ... or somehow outside the Overton window, outside the bounds of reasonable discourse,\u201d Vance said in an interview last week in Rome, where he attended Pope Leo XIV\u2019s inaugural Mass. \u201cI think that it is very, very dangerous to use the neutral institutions of state \u2014 the military, the police forces ... the intel services \u2014 to try to delegitimize another competing political party. I think that\u2019s especially true when that political party just got second in an election and is, depending on which poll you believe, either the [most] popular or the second-most popular party.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump confidant who has wielded significant White House power, has gone further than Vance and Rubio, having campaigned with AfD ahead of elections in February, when the party finished in second place and further established its popularity.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk posted on X, his social media site, in December.",
      "The Rubio-led State Department reinforced the Trump administration\u2019s line Tuesday.",
      "In a post on Substack, Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, wrote that the German government \u201chas established elaborate systems to monitor and censor online speech under the guise of combating disinformation and preventing offense.\u201d",
      "Samson specifically cited the recent decision to label AfD as extremist. He also raised concerns about the treatment of far-right parties and leaders in other European countries, including Marine Le Pen, whose recent embezzlement conviction in France could prevent her from running for president in a 2027 race she had been favored to win.",
      "\u201cAmericans are familiar with these tactics. Indeed, a similar strategy of censorship, demonization, and bureaucratic weaponization was utilized against President Trump and his supporters,\u201d Samson wrote. \u201cWhat this reveals is that the global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy. Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people.\u201d",
      "Samson added that \u201cEurope\u2019s democratic backsliding not only impacts European citizens but increasingly affects American security and economic ties, along with the free speech rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur hope,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that both Europe and the United States can recommit to our Western heritage, and that European nations will end the weaponization of government against those seeking to defend it.\u201d",
      "Vance emphasized similar themes in a speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, where he chastised German leaders for, among other things, refusing to include AfD in the country\u2019s governing coalition despite its electoral gains. While he was in Germany, Vance met with Friedrich Merz, now the chancellor, and with Alice Weidel, a co-chair of the AfD.",
      "An AfD spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The party has long denied the charge that it is an extremist group, and it sued Germany\u2019s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution over the intelligence agency\u2019s recent classification. A spokesperson for the agency, citing the lawsuit, declined to comment.",
      "During last week\u2019s interview, Vance emphasized that he has not endorsed AfD or encouraged Germans to support it. He described his and Rubio\u2019s advocacy as a matter of democratic principles.",
      "Trump\u2019s first campaign for president in 2016 fed on chants by his supporters to \u201clock her up!\u201d \u2014 a reference to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who had not been charged with any crime. More recently, he and his allies accused former President Joe Biden, who beat Trump in his 2020 re-election bid, of weaponizing the Justice Department against Trump and other Republicans.",
      "The Trump administration launched an investigation this month of former FBI Director James Comey, a Trump critic who had shared on social media a photo of seashells arranged to spell out \u201c8647.\u201d",
      "Trump allies interpreted the message as an assassination threat, noting that \u201c86\u201d can be a slang term for getting rid of something and that Trump is the 47th president. Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has called for Comey to be imprisoned over the post. But the number 86 does not always have violent connotations; it\u2019s use in the hospitality industry can refer to removing or refusing service to a customer.",
      "Asked how his and Rubio\u2019s concerns square with such Trump administration actions and rhetoric, Vance argued that there is a \u201creasonable\u201d question about whether Comey had advocated for Trump\u2019s assassination.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a pretty big believer in free speech,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that saying you should kill Donald Trump is an acceptable part of public debate. Everybody\u2019s going to draw their line. I think where I draw the line is encouraging violence against political opponents. If there\u2019s a determination that Comey encouraged violence against a political opponent, then that\u2019s a problem. And if there\u2019s a determination that he didn\u2019t, then that\u2019s a different question.\u201d",
      "While Vance has not endorsed AfD, he described a pro-AfD piece Musk wrote in December as \u201cinteresting.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlso interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite,\u201d Vance wrote in his Jan. 2 social media post that called attention to Musk\u2019s piece. \u201cBut AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.\u201d",
      "AfD was founded in 2013, its early messaging geared toward anti-European Union voters. In subsequent years, the party became known for its strident anti-immigrant rhetoric. In 2017, an AfD ad criticized as Islamophobic asked: \u201cBurkas? We prefer bikinis.\u201d Another, featuring the image of a pregnant woman, asked: \u201cNew Germans? We\u2019ll make them ourselves.\u201d",
      "The party has grown in popularity, coinciding with a rise of right-wing voter sentiment across the United States and Europe. Last year, AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazis.",
      "Meanwhile, links and comparisons between AfD and the Nazis have been inescapable.",
      "At an AfD rally in 2017, attendees chanted that they would \u201cbuild a subway\u201d to Auschwitz for their political opponents. A founding AfD member, Alexander Gauland, once described the Nazi era as a mere \u201cspeck\u201d of bird excrement in German history. A party leader, Bj\u00f6rne H\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. (He has appealed the rulings.) Another AfD politician, Maximilian Krah, resigned his party leadership post under pressure and suspended campaign activities last year after he said the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d",
      "When Musk appeared virtually at an AfD campaign event in January, he leaned into a talking point consistent with the party\u2019s desire to move beyond the guilt over Nazi-era atrocities, lamenting that \u201cthere is too much focus on past guilt.\u201d The same week, Musk faced criticism after he offered a gesture many found similar to a Nazi salute at a Trump rally in Washington.",
      "In its designation of AfD as an extremist organization on May 2, the German intelligence agency asserted that the party \u201caims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society.\u201d AfD also does not consider German nationals with histories of migration from Muslim countries as equal to German people, the agency added at the time.",
      "The report drew a quick rebuke from Rubio, who is also Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "\u201cGermany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,\u201d Rubio wrote on X. \u201cThat\u2019s not democracy \u2014 it\u2019s tyranny in disguise.\u201d",
      "Vance then piggybacked on Rubio\u2019s post with a Cold War analogy.",
      "\u201cThe AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt \u2014 not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.\u201d",
      "Vance contended in last week\u2019s interview that holding down a rival political party because of its beliefs allows its beliefs to \u201ctake on an almost mystical power\u201d by removing them from the public dialogue.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like Nazism, and I don\u2019t like people who are sympathetic with Nazis,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut I think the way to beat back against it is to debate it and defeat it and not believe that you can, kind of, like, bury this thing underground, because you can\u2019t.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the former surgeon at the center of France\u2019s largest child sexual abuse case, was handed a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison Wednesday as his three-month-long trial reached its end.",
      "French courts convicted Le Scouarnec, 74, of sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys whose average age was 11. Many were assaulted while they were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors said.",
      "Himself a father of three, Le Scouarnec confessed to committing \u201chideous acts\u201d during the trial in the northwestern town of Vannes in the region of Brittany, where he admitted to all of the charges.",
      "\u201cI am not asking the court for leniency,\u201d Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement, adding, \u201cSimply grant me the right to become a better person.\u201d",
      "His sentence will run concurrently with the 15 years he is serving after he was found guilty in 2020 of raping a young neighbor and three others when they were children.",
      "The court said Le Scouarnec's sentence cannot be adjusted until he has served two-thirds of it, in order to prevent recidivism, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. The judges also followed the public prosecutor\u2019s recommendations about the sentence.",
      "After lawyers for some of the victims complained that he could be released by 2030 if his pretrial detention and parole eligibility were taken into account, the prosecution made a rare request that he be held in a treatment center under supervision even after his release. It was not clear whether the court granted the request.",
      "Hundreds of witnesses testified at the trial, including Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend. Now in their 40s, both said he assaulted them in the early 1980s. However, French law did not allow him to be prosecuted for their alleged abuse because it happened too long ago.",
      "Many victims have said they do not remember being assaulted, but police were able to build a case against Le Scouarnec because he meticulously cataloged his abuse in digital diaries.",
      "In France it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under age 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged.",
      "The case has put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed Le Scouarnec, a once-respected local doctor, to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse.",
      "Lawyers for some of the victims said Le Scouarnec should have been stripped of his medical privileges after that case. Instead, he worked across nine public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates also hope the case will prompt a hard look at what they call the lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d Francesca Satta, a lawyer who represented 10 victims and families, said previously, adding, \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "During the trial, many victims watched the proceedings through a video link in a 450-seat auditorium, a short walk from the courthouse, which was too small to cope with the number of people who wanted to watch the case unfold. Two other transmission rooms in a former law school broadcast the trial to the media and spectators."

      "Researchers in Spain say they have found evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating art \u2014 challenging the idea that art began with the modern humans who succeeded them.",
      "The canvas was a quartz-rich granite pebble that was excavated from a rock shelter in central Spain in 2022, in a layer dating back 42,000 to 43,000 years. Measuring more than 8 inches long, the pebble has curves and indentations that make it resemble a human face.",
      "In the middle of its surface is a single red dot, right where a nose would be, researchers said in a study published Saturday in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, adding that it appeared to be a nonutilitarian object rather than a tool.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset we could tell it was peculiar,\u201d said David \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, lead author of the paper.",
      "Analysis showed that the red dot consisted of ocher, a natural earth pigment. The next step was to determine how it got there.",
      "While not visible to the naked eye, the red dot was confirmed by Spanish forensic police to be a fingerprint, leaving \u201cno doubt\u201d that it was applied to the stone intentionally by a finger dipped in ocher, \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The researchers postulate that the Neanderthal, who, based on the fingerprint, was possibly an adult male, perceived the pebble as resembling a face \u2014 a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia \u2014 and was inspired to complete the depiction, creating \u201cone of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be a clear act of symbolization \u2014 apparently very simple, yet meaningful,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "The discovery is \u201cdoubly exceptional\u201d since it\u2019s the \u201cmost complete\u201d Neanderthal fingerprint identified to date, apart from a partial one previously found in Germany, the researchers said.",
      "Neanderthals, a distinct species that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, lived alongside early modern humans in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for at least part of their existence. Characterized by a large nose and relatively short and stocky bodies, the species is very closely related to humans, or Homo sapiens.",
      "The remains of Neanderthals do not show clear evidence of lower intelligence than modern humans, some scientists have argued.",
      "The stone is \u201cone of a small but growing number of discoveries that point to the existence of symbolic behavior among Neanderthals,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "However, it\u2019s \u201cclearly an isolated object, with no known parallels\u201d that can be used for comparison, he added.",
      "\u201cWe should not try to draw direct analogies between the Neanderthal and sapiens worlds,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said, as Neanderthals did not create a visual symbolic system as complex and diverse as the one developed by Homo sapiens.",
      "\u201cThis pebble doesn\u2019t solve the mystery, but it offers one more clue suggesting the presence of a complex mind \u2014 one capable of producing symbols,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cWhat Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t realize is that if it weren\u2019t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD,\u201d wrote Trump, who appears to be losing patience over the lack of a ceasefire deal, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s playing with fire!\u201d",
      "Around three hours later, Medvedev took to X, writing: \u201cI only know of one REALLY BAD thing \u2014 WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!\u201d",

Cautioning that Russia was stoking fears of another world war, Kellogg wrote that it was \u201cunfitting of a world power.\u201d",

      "Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader with whom he can do business, and the pair had a friendly, if fruitless, phone call last week. Shortly afterward, Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine would \u201cimmediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "But as Putin has stalled on the peace talks, Trump's frustration appears to have grown with him; he called Putin \u201ccrazy\u201d on Truth Social on Sunday after Moscow launched widespread strikes on Ukraine. The Kremlin dismissed his comments as \u201cemotional overload.\u201d",
      "Russia previously said it was working on a memorandum of understanding outlining Moscow\u2019s demands as part of the negotiations with Kyiv. But Tuesday, Kellogg said the United States was still awaiting \u201creceipt of RU Memorandum (Term Sheet) that you promised a week ago.\u201d",

      "She added that it would be sent to Ukraine, which has previously rejected Russian demands that it never join NATO, accept permanent \u201cneutrality\u201d between Moscow and the West, and cede its demand for four territories in the east of the country that Russia illegally annexed months after the war began.",
      "Inside Ukraine, Russian forces continue their slow grind forward on the battlefield. Ukrainian officials said one person was killed and more than two dozen people were injured by ballistic missile strikes across the country overnight.",
