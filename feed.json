      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s a magical feeling,\" Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this moment now. It\u2019s about all those moments along the trail.\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly amazing 10 days and I soaked in every part of it \u2014 the lows, the highs, the in-betweens. ... I\u2019m really proud of these dogs and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit,\" Holmes said.",
      "He gave a special salute to his two lead canines, Hercules, his half-sprint dog, and Polar, saying, \u201cHe's the brains behind the operation.\u201d",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive."

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A representative for the estate of actor Gene Hackman is seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports, especially photographs and police body-camera video, related to the recent deaths of Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa after their partially mummified bodies were discovered at their New Mexico home in February.",
      "Authorities last week announced Hackman died at age 95 of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 took the life of his 65-year-old wife.",
      "Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed signs of activity on Feb. 18, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm on the day he likely died. The couple's bodies weren't discovered until Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the Santa Fe home and alerted police, leaving a mystery for law enforcement and medical investigators to unravel.",
      "Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.",
      "The request, filed Tuesday, also described the couple's discrete lifestyle in Santa Fe since Hackman's retirement. The state capital city is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "The couple \"lived an exemplary private life for over thirty years in Santa Fe, New Mexico and did not showcase their lifestyle,\u201d the petition said.",
      "New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased, said Amanda Lavin, legal director at the nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government. Some medical information also is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "At the same time, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability, she said.",
      "\u201cI do think it does infringe on transparency if the court were to prohibit release of all the investigation records, including the autopsies,\u201d Lavin said Thursday. \u201cThe whole idea of those records being available is to ensure accountability in the way those investigations are done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is also a public health concern given that hantavirus was involved,\u201d Lavin said.",
      "She said the preemptive request to prevent the release of government records on constitutional grounds is unusual.",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",

      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",

      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",

      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",

It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "When it came time to give her award speech, the tears were immediate. \u201cThis category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill \u2014\u201d she said, correcting herself. \u201cThree women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.\u201d",

      "Flack was one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer due to her intimate vocal and musical style, died last month. She was 88.",
      "Flack's \u201cCelebration of Life\u201d memorial will be livestreamed from New York on Monday afternoon.",
      "Here's everything you need to know:",
      "Flack's Celebration of Life will take place at the Abyssinian Baptist Church beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern. It is open to the public. The service will also be livestreamed at www.RobertaFlack.com.",
      "It is a fitting location: Flack grew up with church gospel; her mother played organ at the Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Church in Arlington, Virginia. As a teen, she began accompanying the church choir on piano.",
      "Flack leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "She will likely be remembered for her classics. Those include \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\u201d written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger. It marked the beginning of Flack's mainstream success when it was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\u201d",
      "But most will think of \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\" when Flack's name comes up in conversation. She first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they\u2019d continue to for decades.",

      "A proposed 100,000-seater arena would surpass Wembley as the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",
      "United did not say how much the stadium would cost or reveal a timeline for its completion, but architect Norman Foster said building work would take five years.",
      "British billionaire Ratcliffe paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in United last year and made a new stadium one of his priorities.",
      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",
      "Twickenham, which is home to the national rugby team, holds 82,500.",
      "Old Trafford is the country\u2019s biggest dedicated soccer stadium with a capacity of just over 74,000, but is dated in comparison to the likes of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, which regularly hosts NFL games.",
      "\u201cOur long-term objective as a club is to have the world\u2019s best football team playing in the world\u2019s best stadium,\" United chief executive Omar Berrada said.",
      "Managerial great Alex Ferguson said the club \"must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

      "Republicans, who have coalesced around Trump's nominees for the health agencies, are likely to ask Oz about his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, including the Trump administration's focus on eliminating fraud from the $1 trillion programs.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, will question Oz's tax filings, which they say show he has used a tax code loophole to underpay taxes by thousands of dollars on Medicare, the program he'll oversee. They will also grill Oz on any cuts he would make to the health insurance coverage as well as comments on his TV show supporting privatized Medicare.",
      "The U.S. Office of Government Ethics has done an \u201cextensive review\u201d of Oz's finances, spokesman Christopher Krepich said in a statement about Oz\u2019s taxes. He added that the office has indicated \u201cany potential conflicts have been resolved and he is in compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "Oz has hawked everything from supplements to private health insurance plans on his former TV series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d which ran for 13 seasons and helped him amass a fortune.",
      "Oz\u2019s net worth is between $98 million and $332 million, according to an analysis of the disclosure, which lists asset values in ranges but does not give precise dollar figures. His most recent disclosure shows he also holds millions of dollars worth of shares in health insurance, fertility, pharmaceutical and vitamin companies. He has promised to divest from dozens of companies that would pose conflicts for him as the CMS administrator.",
      "In the job, he could wield significant power over most health companies operating in the U.S. because he can make decisions about who and what are covered by Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Oz's hearing comes as the Trump administration seeks to finalize leadership posts for the nation\u2019s top health agencies. On Thursday, Senate committees voted to advance the nominations of Marty Makary, poised to lead the Food and Drug Administration, and Jay Bhattacharya, set to helm the National Institutes for Health, for a full Senate vote. The nomination of Dave Weldon to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was abruptly withdrawn Thursday.",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",
      "The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.",
      "\u201cOur picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,\u201d Yigra said. \u201cThat image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.\u201d",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",
      "Much of the funding to the Africa CDC and regional governments was lost with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate most foreign aid contracts and cut $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance abroad. Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies.

      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",

      "New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people in the country",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "President Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting ready to appear before Congress",
      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

    "story": [
      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "Breathing in polluted air over a long period of time can cause respiratory illness, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, said Fatimah Ahamad, chief scientist and air pollution expert at Malaysia-based Sunway Centre for Planetary Health. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution kills around 7 million people each year.",
      "Ahamad said much more needs to be done to cut air pollution levels. The WHO had earlier found that 99% of the world\u2019s population lives in places that do not meet recommended air quality levels.",
      "\u201cIf you have bad water, no water, you can tell people to wait for half an hour a day, the water will come. But if you have bad air, you cannot tell people to pause breathing,\u201d she said.",
      "Several cities like Beijing, Seoul, South Korea, and Rybnik in Poland have successfully improved their air quality through stricter regulations on pollution from vehicles, power plants and industry. They've also promoted cleaner energy and invested in public transportation.",
      "Another notable effort to curb severe air pollution was the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreement on transboundary haze pollution. Even though its had limited success so far, ten countries in the region pledged to work together to monitor and curb pollution from large forest fires, a common occurrence in the region during dry seasons.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said many of the regions witnessing the worst air pollution are also places where planet-heating gases are released extensively through the burning of coal, oil and gas. Slashing planet-warming emissions to slow the heating up of the planet can also improve air quality, she said.",
      "Air pollution and climate crisis \u201care two sides of the same coin,\u201d she said. ___",

      "NEW DELHI -- Millions of people in South Asia celebrated Holi, the Hindu festival of colors, on Friday by smearing each other with brightly colored powder, dancing to festive music and feasting on traditional sweets prepared for the occasion.",
      "The raucous spring festival sees Hindus take part in a kaleidoscopic celebration of the end of winter and the triumph of good over evil. The festival is a national holiday in India, while in Nepal it's a two-day event that began Thursday. It's also observed in other South Asian countries as well as among the Indian diaspora.",
      "Holi has its origins in Hindu mythology and lore and celebrates the divine love between the Hindu god Krishna and his consort Radha, and signifies a time of rebirth and rejuvenation.",
      "Across the country, people, mostly dressed in all white clothes, celebrated the festival by hurling colored powder at each other. Children, perched on rooftops and balconies, flung water balloons filled with colored pigments at passers by.",

      "Amid massive celebrations in the west Indian city of Ahmedabad, thousands of people gathered at temple were sprayed with colored water from huge pipes as they swayed to traditional Gujarati music, clapping over their heads.",
      "Food and drink are a big part of the festivities. Vendors in parts of India sold thandai, a traditional light green beverage prepared with milk, cardamom and dried fruit, and gujia, a flaky, deep-fried sweet pastry stuffed with milk curds, nuts and dried fruit.",
      "Another tradition that marks Holi is bhang, a local drink prepared with cannabis and consumed with milk or water. The drink is connected to Hinduism, particularly to Lord Shiva, and is also enjoyed during other religious festivals in the region. Its consumption is permissible under Indian law and it is also sold at government licensed shops.",
      "In many parts of India, people also light large bonfires the night before the festival to signify the destruction of evil and victory of good. Families gather around the flames to sing, dance and pray to Hindu gods.",
      "In two northern towns, hundreds of women celebrated last week by playfully hitting men who teased them as a part of ritual with wooden sticks. The festival is called \u201cLathmar Hol,\u201d or Stick Holi.",

      "Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products April 2. He has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.",
      "The U.S. trade war and Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",

      "Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance and the public to inform on women refusing to wear the country's mandatory headscarf in public, even as hard-liners push for harsher penalties for those protesting the law",
      "GENEVA -- GENEVA (AP) \u2014 Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance and the public to inform on women refusing to wear the country's mandatory headscarf in public, even as hard-liners push for harsher penalties for those protesting the law, a United Nations report released Friday found.",
      "The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the \u201cphysical violence\u201d that led to the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death led to nationwide protests against the country\u2019s mandatory hijab laws and the public disobedience against them that continues even today, despite the threat of violent arrest and imprisonment.",
      "\u201cTwo and a half years after the protests began in September 2022, women and girls in Iran continue to face systematic discrimination, in law and in practice, that permeates all aspects of their lives, particularly with respect to the enforcement of the mandatory hijab,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThe state is increasingly reliant on state-sponsored vigilantism in an apparent effort to enlist businesses and private individuals in hijab compliance, portraying it as a civic responsibility.\u201d",
      "Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the findings of the 20-page report.",
      "In it, U.N. investigators outline how Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance. Among the efforts include Iranian officials deploying \u201caerial drone surveillance\u201d to monitor women in public places. At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities installed facial recognition software at its entrance gate to also find women not wearing the hijab, it said.",
      "Surveillance cameras on Iran's major roadways also are believed to be involved in searching for uncovered women. U.N. investigators said they obtained the \u201cNazer\u201d mobile phone app offered by Iranian police, which allows the public to report on uncovered women in vehicles, including ambulances, buses, metro cars and taxis.",
      "\u201cUsers may add the location, date, time and the license plate number of the vehicle in which the alleged mandatory hijab infraction occurred, which then \u2018flags\u2019 the vehicle online, alerting the police,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt then triggers a text message (in real-time) to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them that they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws, and that their vehicles would be impounded for ignoring these warnings.\u201d",
      "Those text messages have led to dangerous situations. In July 2024, police officers shot and paralyzed a woman who activists say had received such a message and was fleeing a checkpoint near the Caspian Sea.",
      "Amini\u2019s death sparked months of protests and a security crackdown that killed more than 500 people and led to the detention of more than 22,000. After the mass demonstrations, police dialed down enforcement of hijab laws, but it ramped up again in April 2024 under what authorities called the Noor \u2014 or \u201cLight\u201d \u2014 Plan. At least 618 women have been arrested under the Noor Plan, the U.N. investigators said, citing a local human rights activist group in Iran.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran executed at least 938 people last year, a threefold increase from 2021, the U.N. said. While many were convicted of drug charges, the report said the executions \u201cindicate a nexus with the overall repression of dissent in this period.\u201d",
      "As Iran continues its crackdown over the hijab, it also faces an economic crisis over U.S. sanctions due to its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While U.S. President Donald Trump has called for new negotiations, Iran has yet to respond to a letter he sent to its 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Social unrest, coupled with the economic woes, remain a concern for Iran's theocracy.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s warning last month that Europe must now take care of security in its own backyard raises troubling questions",
      "BRUSSELS -- In the year after Russia launched outright war on Ukraine, NATO leaders approved a set of military plans designed to repel an invasion of Europe. It was the biggest shake-up of the alliance\u2019s defense readiness preparations since the Cold War.",
      "The secret plans set out how Western allies would defend NATO territory from the Atlantic to the Arctic, through the Baltic region and Central Europe, down to the Mediterranean Sea. Up to 300,000 troops would move to its eastern flank within 30 days, many of them American. That would climb to 800,000 within six months.",
      "But the Trump administration warned last month that U.S. priorities lie elsewhere. Europe must take care of its own security, and those goals now seem questionable. Mustering just 30,000 European troops to police any future peace in Ukraine is proving a challenge.",
      "Billions of euros are being shifted to military budgets, but only slowly, and the Europeans are struggling to fire up production in their defense industries.",
      "Beyond funding, tens of thousands more European citizens might have to complete military service, and time is of the essence. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has warned that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on European territory in 2030.",
      "Concerned about Russia's intentions, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wants to introduce large-scale military training for every adult male, and double the size of Poland's army to around 500,000 soldiers.",
      "\u201cIf Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice or capitulation \u2026 then, without a doubt \u2014 and we can all agree on that \u2014 Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,\u201d Tusk warned lawmakers last week.",
      "The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Europe, including the U.K., has almost 1.5 million active duty personnel. But many can't be deployed on a battlefield, and those who can are hard to use effectively without a centralized command system.",
      "The number of Russian troops in Ukraine at the end of 2024 was estimated to be around 700,000.",
      "NATO troops are controlled by a U.S. general, using American air transport and logistics.",
      "Analysts say that in the event of a Russian attack, NATO\u2019s top military officer would probably dispatch around 200,000 U.S. troops to Europe to build on the 100,000 U.S. military personnel already based there.",
      "With the Americans out of the picture, \u201ca realistic estimate may therefore be that an increase in European capacities equivalent to the fighting capacity of 300,000 U.S. troops is needed,\u201d the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank estimates.",
      "\u201cEurope faces a choice: either increase troop numbers significantly by more than 300,000 to make up for the fragmented nature of national militaries, or find ways to rapidly enhance military coordination,\u201d Bruegel said.",
      "The question is how.",
      "NATO is encouraging countries to build up personnel numbers, but the trans-Atlantic alliance isn't telling them how to do it. Maintaining public support for the armed forces and for Ukraine is too important to risk by dictating choices.",
      "\u201cThe way they go about it is intensely political, so we wouldn\u2019t prescribe any way of changing this \u2014 whether to go for conscription, elective conscription, bigger reserves,\u201d a senior NATO official said on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief journalists unless he remained unnamed.",
      "\u201cWe do stress the point that fighting with those regional plans means that we are in collective defense and likely in an attrition war that requires way more manpower than we currently have, or we designed our force models to deliver,\u201d he added.",
      "Eleven European countries have compulsory military service: Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, and non-European Union nation Norway. The length of service ranges from as little as two months in Croatia to 19 months in Norway.",
      "Poland isn't considering a return to universal military service, but rather a reserve system based on the model in Switzerland, where every man is obliged to serve in the armed forces or an alternative civilian service. Women can volunteer.",
      "Belgium\u2019s new defense minister plans to write a letter in November to around 120,000 citizens who are age 18 to try to persuade at least 500 of them to sign up for voluntary military service. Debate about the issue goes on in the U.K. and Germany.",
      "Germany\u2019s professional armed forces had 181,174 active service personnel at the end of last year \u2014 slightly lower than in 2023, according to a parliamentary report released Tuesday. That means it\u2019s no closer to reaching a Defense Ministry target of 203,000 by 2031.",
      "Last year, 20,290 people started serving in the German military, or Bundeswehr, an 8% increase, the report said. But of the 18,810 who joined in 2023, more than a quarter \u2014 5,100 or 27% of the total \u2014 left again, most at their own request during the six-month trial period.",
      "The German parliament\u2019s commissioner for the armed forces, Eva H\u00f6gl, said that army life is a hard sell.",
      "\u201cThe biggest problem is boredom,\u201d H\u00f6gl said. \u201cIf young people have nothing to do, if there isn\u2019t enough equipment and there aren\u2019t enough trainers, if the rooms aren\u2019t reasonably clean and orderly, that deters people and it makes the Bundeswehr unattractive.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the scale, tiny Luxembourg has unique demographic challenges. Of its roughly 630,000 passport holders, only 315,000 are Luxembourgers. The number of people of military service age \u2014 18 to 40 \u2014 is smaller still.",
      "Around 1,000 people are enlisted. That\u2019s small compared to some European powers, but bigger per capita than the U.K. armed forces. Recently, Luxembourg \u2014 where unemployment is low and salaries are high \u2014 has struggled to find just 200-300 military personnel.",
      "Military service comes with many challenges too, not least convincing someone to sign up when they might be sent to the front, and hastily trained conscripts can't replace a professional army. The draft also costs money. Extra staff, accommodation and trainers are needed throughout a conscript's term.",

Security Council, along with France and Britain, that took part in the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal preliminary framework agreement alongside Germany and the European Union. Trump withdrew America from the accord in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions in the wider Middle East.",
      "China and Russia have particularly close relations with Iran through energy deals and Iran has provided Russia with bomb-carrying drones in its war against Ukraine.",

      "The militant group in the Gaza Strip did not immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would occur \u2014 or what it expected to get in return.",
      "Alexander was 19 when he was abducted from his base on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war.",
      "It was not clear which mediators had proposed the release to Hamas. The United States, led by the Trump administration's hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been pushing for a proposal that would extend the truce and see a limited number of hostage for prisoner exchanges.",
      "Following the Hamas statement, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \u201caccepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility,\u201d but said that \u201cHamas is refusing and will not budge from its positions.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare \u2014 the reports about Hamas\u2019 willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,\u201d the prime minister's office said.",
      "It added that Netanyahu would convene his ministerial team on Saturday night to receive a detailed report from the negotiation team and \u201cdecide on the next steps for the release of hostages.\u201d",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago.",
      "The White House last week made a surprise announcement, saying that American officials had engaged in \u201congoing talks and discussions\u201d with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. That prompted a terse response from Netanyahu\u2019s office.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether those talks were at all linked to Hamas\u2019 Friday announcement about the release of the American hostage.",
      "In a separate statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas\u2019 commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war, and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.",
      "Israel has been pressing Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "Two weeks ago, Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza and its more than 2 million people as it pressed Hamas to agree. The militant group has said that the move would affect the remaining hostages as well.",
      "Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire\u2019s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace.",
      "The militant group said with support cut off to Gaza, some 80% of the population has now lost access to food sources, with aid distribution halted and markets running out of supplies, while 90% are unable to access clean drinking water.",
      "In Jerusalem, some 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed on Friday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound for the second week of Ramadan, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is tightly controlling access, allowing only men over 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied territory for the prayers.",
      "\u201cThe conditions are extremely difficult,\u201d said Yousef Badeen, a Palestinian who had left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem, said. \u201cWe wish they will open it for good.\u201d",
      "Hamas accused Israel of escalating a \u201creligious war\u201d against Palestinians with what it called the \u201csystematic targeting of Muslim religious practices\u201d through its restrictions at Al-Aqsa mosque.",

      "BANGKOK -- The United Nations food agency said on Friday that more than 1 million people in the war-torn nation of Myanmar will be cut off from food assistance due to critical funding shortfalls.",
      "A statement released by the World Food Program said that most food rations currently distributed in Myanmar will be cut off in April, even as the country faces a desperate humanitarian crisis caused by bitter fighting between the military government and powerful militias opposed to its rule. The WFP said it would need $60 million to continue food assistance in Myanmar and called on its partners to identify additional funding.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the WFP\u2019s decision was directly related to the Trump administration's recent moves to stop most foreign aid and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which have had wide-ranging effects on humanitarian efforts around the globe.",
      "A 90-day freeze on foreign assistance programs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump has led to other cuts in services for refugees from Myanmar, including the shutdown of hospital care in camps in neighboring Thailand where more than 100,000 are living, according to activists and Thai officials.",
      "The U.S. has been a \u201ccore contributor in the food security and livelihood sector in Myanmar,\u201d and there was already a shortfall last year with humanitarian needs only about 40% funded, said a senior leader in the aid sector based in Asia, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the issue.",
      "The new cuts, she said, have created a \u201cdevastating situation,\u201d forcing NGOs to abandon many programs, hitting vulnerable populations like people with disabilities, women and children the hardest, she said.",
      "\u201cThe lifesaving work must continue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible for us to stop that because if we stop it means people will not survive. But the funding gap we\u2019re facing has forced us to close programs that are the lifeline, I think, for many people, in Myanmar.\u201d",
      "The nationwide armed conflict in Myanmar began after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.",
      "In Friday\u2019s statement, the WFP said 15.2 million people, nearly one-third of the total population, are unable to meet their minimum daily food needs, and some 2.3 million face emergency levels of hunger.",
      "The WFP said it will only be able to assist 35,000 of the most vulnerable people, including children under the age of 5, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people living with disabilities.",
      "\u201cThe impending cuts will have a devastating impact on the most vulnerable communities across the country, many of whom depend entirely on WFP\u2019s support to survive,\u201d said Michael Dunford, WFP\u2019s Representative and Country Director in Myanmar. \u201cWFP remains steadfast in its commitment to support the people of Myanmar, but more immediate funding is crucial to continue reaching those in need.\u201d",
      "The WFP said the cuts will also impact almost 100,000 internally displaced people, including Rohingya communities in camps in Myanmar\u2019s western state of Rakhine, who will have no access to food without WFP assistance.",
      "The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, have long been persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. More than 700,000 have fled from Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military launched a clearance operation against the minority in response to attacks by a rebel group.",
      "More than 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, confined to squalid displacement camps, in addition to those living in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh. Still, more have fled toward Bangladesh and elsewhere in recent months as violence surged again when a group called the Arakan Army started fighting against Myanmar\u2019s security forces."

      "The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations to resettle Palestinians from the Gaza Strip",
      "JERUSALEM -- The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials say.",
      "The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump\u2019s stated goal of resettling Gaza\u2019s Palestinians in a \u201cbeautiful area.\u201d",
      "Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s plan, Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project.",
      "The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel\u2019s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a \u201c bold vision.\u201d",
      "Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime.",
      "Still, the White House says Trump \u201cstands by his vision.\u201d",
      "Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.",
      "Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives \u2014 financial, diplomatic and security \u2014 to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords \u2014 a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts.",
      "The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel\u2019s postwar planning, also had no comment.",
      "But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls \u201cvoluntary\u201d emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a \u201cvery large emigration department\u201d within its Defense Ministry.",
      "Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached.",
      "The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020.",
      "As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group.",
      "The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden's administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide.",
      "The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support.",
      "Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.",
      "One of them said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives.",
      "Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. \u201cThis suggestion was immediately rebuffed,\u201d said one official. \u201dNo one opened this matter again.\u201d",
      "Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders\u2019 summit last week in Cairo that his country \u201ccategorically rejects\" any plan that aims to transfer \"the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.\u201d",
      "Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory.",
      "Somaliland\u2019s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority.",
      "An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was \u201chaving a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.\u201d",
      "The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory\u2019s solidarity with the Palestinians.",
      "The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory's strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally.",
      "Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia\u2019s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world.",
      "An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians.",
      "Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump\u2019s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move.",
      "Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country\u2019s strong support for Palestinian self-rule.",
      "\u201cThe realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda in why Somalia,\u201d Chepkorir said.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better day to be a baby wombat in Australia,\u201d Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement after a government official confirmed Jones had flown from the country voluntarily.",
      "In the video, Montana-based Jones lifts the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside then runs away from its mother. \u201cI caught a baby wombat,\u201d she said as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.",
      "Burke had said earlier Friday the conditions of her visa were being reviewed to determine whether immigration law has been breached. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don\u2019t expect she will return,\u201d he said in the statement received by The Associated Press.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. \u201cTo take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cI suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Friday.",
      "The wombat appears to be common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.",
      "Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that we didn\u2019t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don\u2019t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,\u201d Vermaak said.",
      "Vermaak also called on Jones to say where the wombat was after the video showed the joey had a skin disease. \u201cThe baby has mange and it\u2019s a matter of time before it dies of mange, so it\u2019s important for us to find where this happened and to get this baby and its mom treated as soon as possible,\u201d Vermaak said.",

      "Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc explained that Duterte had been allowed to participate in his first ICC hearing by videoconference because he had just come off a long flight. Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth.",
      "Duterte, was to be read his rights and formally informed of the charges of crimes against humanity that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation. His supporters contest the arrest and say the court doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Estimates of the death toll during Duterte\u2019s presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000, according to numbers from human rights groups.",
      "The court is expected to set a date for a key pretrial hearing \u2014 likely months from now \u2014 at which judges will assess whether there is enough evidence to proceed to a full trial, which could take years. If Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.",
      "His daughter, Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, met with supporters outside the court Friday, and said that she was seeking to visit her father and to have the hearing moved. She didn't elaborate. Duterte is a a political rival of the current president.",
      "\u201cWell, our expectation is that ... they will give us permission to visit the former president, and (the) other one is we hope that they will allow our request to move the initial appearance,\u201d she said.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. He was swiftly put on a chartered jet and flown to the Netherlands. After a series of medical checks on arrival, he was taken to the court's detention center, located behind the high brick walls of a Dutch prison complex close to the North Sea coastline.",
      "Duterte's supporters outside the court chanted \u2019\u2019Send him back! Send him back!\u2033 as they waited for his arrival. Activists marched in the Philippine capital region, demanding justice for the thousands of suspects killed in Duterte\u2019s brutal crackdowns. Other groups set up large screens to allow families of suspects killed in the crackdowns to watch the ICC proceedings.",
      "Prosecutors accuse him of involvement as an \u201cindirect co-perpetrator\u201d in multiple murders, amounting to a crime against humanity for allegedly overseeing killings from November 2011 until March 2019, first while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao and later as president of the Philippines.",
      "According to the prosecution request for his arrest, Duterte, as Davao mayor, issued orders to police and other \u201chitmen\u201d who formed so-called Davao Death Squads, or DDS.",
      "He told them \u201cthat their mission was to kill criminals, including drug dealers, and provided clearance for specific DDS killings,\u201d prosecutors allege, adding that he recruited, paid and rewarded the killers and \u201cprovided them with the necessary weapons and resources, and promised to shield them from prosecution.\u201d",
      "The document seeking an ICC warrant for Duterte said that prosecutors built their case using evidence including witness testimony, speeches by Duterte himself, government documents and video footage.",
      "Human rights groups and victims' families have hailed Duterte\u2019s arrest as a historic triumph against state impunity, while the former president's supporters have slammed what they call the government\u2019s surrender of a rival to a court whose jurisdiction they dispute.",
      "\u201cWe are happy and we feel relieved,\u201d said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she said was tortured and killed in 2016.",
      "\"Duterte\u2019s appearance before the ICC is a testament to the courage and determination of the victims, their families, and Filipino activists and journalists to pursue justice no matter how long it takes,\u201d said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cOther leaders facing ICC arrest warrants, like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, should take note that even those who seem untouchable today can end up in The Hague.\u201d",
      "Duterte\u2019s legal team said that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s administration shouldn't have allowed the global court to take custody of the former leader because the Philippines is no longer a party to the ICC.",
      "Harry Roque, the former presidential spokesperson of Duterte, told reporters outside the ICC that he has applied to be accredited as one of the ex-president\u2019s lawyers. If approved, he would raise what he said was Duterte\u2019s illegal arrest by Philippine authorities and the ICC\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over the Philippines, which withdrew from the global court when Duterte was the president.",
      "The ICC judges who issued his arrest warrant say that the alleged crimes he is charged with happened before the Philippines withdrew from the court.",

      "The British economy unexpectedly shrank during January, piling pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves before a key statement about the state of the public finances later this month",
      "LONDON -- The British economy unexpectedly shrank during January, piling pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves before a key statement about the state of the public finances later this month.",
      "Official figures Friday showed that the economy, the world's sixth-largest, saw output drop by 0.1% during the month, in contrast to expectations for a modest increase and December's solid 0.4% gain.",
      "The Office of National Statistics said the weak performance was largely due to bad weather affecting the manufacturing and construction sectors, despite a solid performance by the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy.",
      "Though monthly figures are notoriously volatile and prone to future revision, the decline puts in sharp relief the struggles the Labour government, elected last July after 14 years in opposition, is having in generating growth.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said raising the U.K.'s economic growth is his government\u2019s number one priority over the next five years. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy's growth performance has been historically lackluster.",
      "Starmer has pledged to boost living standards and generate funds for cash-starved public services. With growth proving elusive, the party\u2019s popularity has fallen sharply since its election victory in July.",
      "Critics say Treasury chief Reeves has been partly responsible for the economic slowdown since Labour returned to power, because she was overly gloomy when taking on her role and increased taxes, particularly on businesses.",
      "After the January figures, she vowed to \u201cturn around the poor performance of more than a decade\u201d and that the government will go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d in promoting policies to boost growth.",
      "In recent weeks, Reeves has set out plans to boost longer-term growth, such as backing a third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. She has also pledged to create a Silicon Valley-like technology hub between the two university towns of Oxford and Cambridge, as well as a \u201creset\u201d of the U.K.\u2019s post-Brexit economic relations with the European Union. She has also pointed to the growth benefits of the recently announced ramp-up in defense spending.",
      "The monthly decline is an uncomfortable backdrop for Reeves before she delivers a budget statement to Parliament on March 26. Because growth isn't generating the tax revenues hoped and borrowing rates remain relatively high, she is expected to announce a package of spending cuts in order to meet her fiscal rules.",
      "Mel Stride, the Treasury spokesman for the main opposition Conservative Party, branded the government a \u201cgrowth killer\u201d, blaming tax rises and proposed changes to employment rights."

      "Top diplomats from Group of 7 have held a first day of talks in Canada as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade and foreign policies have thrown the bloc's once solid unity into disarray",
      "LA MALBAIE, Canada -- Top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies held a first day of talks in Canada on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade and foreign policies have thrown the bloc\u2019s once solid unity into disarray. Trump then made new comments antagonizing Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Canadian hosts.",
      "The two-day meeting opened just after Trump threatened to impose 200% tariffs on European wine and other alcohol if the European Union doesn\u2019t back down from retaliating against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a levy on American whiskey.",
      "The escalating trade war added to uncertainty over relations between the U.S. and its closest allies, which have already been strained by Trump\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "It also meant that Rubio, on his first official trip to Canada and his first to a G7 event, was likely to hear a litany of complaints as he met with the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.",
      "All of them have been angered by the new American president\u2019s policies, and they smiled stiffly in frigid temperatures as they posed for a group photo at a snowy resort in La Malbaie, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River.",
      "\u201cPeace and stability is at the top of our agenda, and I look forward to discussing how we continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s illegal aggression,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said as she gaveled the meetings into session.",
      "Rubio had met earlier with Joly, arriving in Quebec late Wednesday just hours after Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in \u2014 prompting irate responses from the European Union and Canada. Neither Rubio nor Joly spoke, and neither the State Department nor the Canadian foreign ministry issued normally customary readouts of the discussion.",
      "In fact, there was little, if any, information to emerge about the closed-door discussions on Thursday that were punctuated by uncertainty over Joly's planned depature for Ottawa on Friday before the G7 meeting had been scheduled to close to attend soon-to-be new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's first Cabinet meeting.",
      "But, en route to Canada from Saudi Arabia, where he had won agreement from Ukraine for a 30-day ceasefire in the war, Rubio had dismissed suggestions that he would face an uncomfortable reception from this counterparts.",
      "Joly, however, had made it clear that Canada, at least, would not back down. Trump has arguably been most antagonistic toward Canada with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and persistent insults against its leadership, much of which he repeated on Thursday in comments at the White House.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Joly had said she would use every meeting at the G7 to raise Trump's tariffs and coordinate a response. She also noted that Trump had continued to press \"his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric.\u201d",
      "For his part, Trump doubled down on the anti-Canada rhetoric during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday with NATO chief Mark Rutte. \u201cTo be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,\u201d Trump said before going on to say that he\u2019s not going to change his mind on the tariffs he\u2019s imposing on Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ripped off for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bend.\"",
      "Rubio had downplayed Trump's earlier comments, saying the president was only expressing what he thought would be a good idea. The G7 \"is not a meeting about how we\u2019re going to take over Canada,\u201d he said.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said G7 nations should avoid panic and posted a message of support for Canada on X, featuring a photo of her and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back, @melaniejoly,\u201d she wrote. \u201c#Canada #Solidarity\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have learned altogether in these shaky geopolitical times ... especially in moments when your heart is really beating, it\u2019s important to keep calm,\u201d Baerbock told reporters. She noted that the G7 has been \u201ca powerhouse \u2026 for freedom, for our common understanding of peace.\u201d",
      "On tariffs, Rubio said G7 partners should understand that these are a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d by Trump to protect American competitiveness.",
      "\u201cI think it is quite possible that we could do these things and at the same time deal in a constructive way with our allies and friends and partners on all the other issues that we work together on,\u201d Rubio had told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I expect out of the G7 and Canada.\u201d",
      "Asked if he expected a difficult reception from his counterparts, Rubio brushed the question aside: \u201cI don\u2019t know, should I be? I mean, they\u2019ve invited us to come. We intend to go. The alternative is to not go. I think that would actually make things worse, not better.\u201d",
      "The agenda for the G7 meeting included discussions on China and the Indo-Pacific; Ukraine and Europe; stability in the Americas; the Middle East; maritime security; Africa; and China, North Korea, Iran and Russia.",

Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived Thursday in Russia for talks with officials on the proposal.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with the U.S. proposal but that the terms need to be worked out, emphasizing it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\u201cSo the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\u201d Putin said at a news conference in Moscow. \u201cBut there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from G7 officials to Putin's comments, although participants were expected to be cautiously optimistic.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s apparent desire to draw Putin back into the fold \u2014 including saying he would like to see Russia rejoin the group to restore it to the G8 \u2014 continues to alarm G7 members. Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "Among international groupings, the G7 \u2014 whose members, with the exception of Japan, are all NATO allies \u2014 had been the toughest on Russia.",

      "It is unclear how Iran will react to the letter, which Trump revealed during a television interview last week. Its intended recipient, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said he's not interested in talks with a \u201cbullying government.\u201d",
      "But Iran struggles with economic woes exacerbated by U.S. and Western sanctions over its nuclear program, and Trump has imposed more since he took office in January. That pressure, coupled with internal turmoil in Iran and recent direct attacks by Israel, has put Tehran in one of the most precarious positions its theocracy has faced since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "\u201cAmerica threatens with military action, but in my opinion, this threat is irrational,\u201d Khamenei said earlier Wednesday. \u201cIran is capable of delivering a reciprocal blow, and it will certainly do so.\u201d",
      "Iranian state television showed Emirati official Anwar Gargash meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Tehran. Gargash's visit had not been previously announced. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman earlier said he'd be carrying the letter from Trump. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, maintains close ties with the United States.",

      "The last time Trump tried to send a letter to Khamenei, through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, the supreme leader mocked the effort. Abe ended up slipping the envelope under his leg in footage widely shared by Iranian state media to this day.",
      "On Wednesday before Gargash's arrival, Khamenei spoke to students during a ceremony in Tehran and called Trump's letter \"an attempt to deceive global public opinion.\u201d",

      "Trump\u2019s overture comes as Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel and Iran have traded direct attacks during the Israel-Hamas war, while partners in Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d are reeling after the assassinations of their leaders by Israel. In Israel, officials have suggested striking Iran\u2019s nuclear program now, something Trump has threatened while insisting he\u2019d prefer reaching a diplomatic deal with Tehran.",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has said Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. A report last month by the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Trump\u2019s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran\u2019s economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production.",
      "Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran\u2019s top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020.",
      "It is unclear how Iran will handle further pressure. The Islamic Republic\u2019s currency, the rial, has dramatically fallen in value. Unemployment and underemployment are rampant. Meanwhile, women have continued their defiance of laws on the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, and go without the head covering, two years after the death of a detained young woman, Mahsa Amini, sparked nationwide protests.",

      "A groundbreaking climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, as Peruvian farmer Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya challenges German energy giant RWE",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- As a crucial climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, experts say the case brought by Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya against German energy giant RWE could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the first cases of its kind \u2014 a case brought by someone directly affected by climate change against a major greenhouse gas emitter \u2014 that has made it all the way to trial,\u201d said Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and an adviser to the non-profit Germanwatch, which has been advising Lliuya.",
      "Lliuya\u2019s lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and painful to see the glaciers melting,\u201d Lliuya, 45, told Associated Press in a video call from Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of concern from people in my community about the future, about the issue of water, because all the rivers that come down from the mountains are used for farming.\u201d",
      "Walker-Crawford said of all these cases around the world, this is the one that\u2019s gone the furthest.",
      "\u201cIt has already set a partial precedent in that the courts found it admissible in 2017, which means that the judges said the case is solid in legal terms,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the court is hearing evidence, and we\u2019ll see whether the company\u2019s responsibility can be proven in this specific case.\u201d",
      "Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, says the reason why the case is so significant is not the decision itself or the amount of damages sought, but the precedent it would set.",
      "\u201cIf we could use tort law to say that any fossil fuel corporation that has contributed significantly to climate change can be held liable for climate-related costs in proportion to their emissions, it could open the door for many similar cases worldwide,\u201d he said.",
      "The case could be \u201ca game changer\u201d, according to Murray Worthy, from Zero Carbon Analytics, a research group on climate change.",
      "\u201cThis case is absolutely crucial,\" Worthy said. \u201cWhile this is just one case focused on this one place in Peru, the wider implications are huge. The costs and damages from climate change could run to tens of trillions of dollars a year, and if fossil fuel companies at large are found to be responsible for those and need to pay those costs, it would completely change the finances and outlook for the entire fossil fuel industry.\u201d",
      "RWE is one of Germany\u2019s largest energy companies, historically recognized as a major producer of electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "RWE says the lawsuit is legally inadmissible and that it sets a dangerous precedent by holding individual emitters accountable for global climate change.",
      "\u201cIn our view, there is no legal basis for holding individual issuers liable for global phenomena such as climate change.

    "story": [
      "Florida\u2019s citrus growers are struggling to survive the one-two punch of hurricanes and disease",
      "LAKE WALES, Fla. -- As Trevor Murphy pulls up to his dad's 20-acre (8-hectare) grove in one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, he points to the cookie-cutter, one-story homes encroaching on the orange trees from all sides.",
      "\u201cAt some point, this isn't going to be an orange grove anymore,\" Murphy, a third-generation grower, says as he gazes at the rows of trees in Lake Wales, Florida. \"You look around here, and it's all houses, and that's going to happen here.\u201d",
      "Polk County, which includes Lake Wales, contains more acres of citrus than any other county in Florida. And in 2023, more people moved to Polk County than any other county in the country.",
      "Hit in recent years by hurricanes and citrus greening disease, which slowly kills the trees, many growers are making the difficult decision to sell orange groves that have been in their families for generations to developers building homes to house the growing population.",
      "Others, like Murphy, are sticking it out, hoping to survive until a bug-free tree or other options arrive to repel the disease or treat the trees.",
      "When Hurricane Irma blasted through the state's orange belt in 2017, Florida's signature crop already had been on a downward spiral for two decades because of the greening disease. Next came a major freeze and two more hurricanes in 2022, followed by two hurricanes last year. A tree that loses branches and foliage in a hurricane can take three years to recover, Murphy said.",
      "Those catastrophes contributed to a 90% decline in orange production over the past two decades. Citrus groves in Florida, which covered more than 832,00 acres (336,698 hectares) at the turn of the century, populated scarcely 275,000 acres (111,288 hectares) last year, and California has eclipsed Florida as the nation's leading citrus producer.",
      "\u201cLosing the citrus industry is not an option. This industry is ... so ingrained in Florida. Citrus is synonymous with Florida,\u201d Matt Joyner, CEO of trade association Florida Citrus Mutual told Florida lawmakers recently.",
      "Nevertheless, Alico Inc., one of Florida\u2019s biggest growers, announced this year that it plans to wind down its citrus operations on more than 53,000 acres (21,000 hectares), saying its production has declined by almost three-quarters in a decade.",
      "That decision hurts processors, including Tropicana, which rely on Alico\u2019s fruit to produce orange juice and must now operate at reduced capacity. Orange juice consumption in the U.S. has been declining for the past two decades, despite a small bump during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A prominent growers group, the Gulf Citrus Growers Association, closed its doors last year.",
      "Pressure on citrus farming is also growing from one of the state's other biggest industries: real estate.",
      "Florida expanded by more than 467,000 people last year to 23 million people, making it the third largest state in the nation. And more homes must be built to house that ever-growing population.",
      "Some prominent, multi-generational citrus families each have been putting hundreds of acres (hectares) of groves up for sale for millions of dollars, or as much as $25,000 an acre.",
      "Murphy owns several hundred acres (hectares) of groves and says he has no plans to abandon the industry, though last year he closed a citrus grove caretaking business that managed thousands of acres for other owners.",
      "However, he also has a real estate license, which is useful given the amount of land that is changing hands. He recently sold off acres in Polk County to a home developer, and has used that money to pay off debt and develop plans to replant thousands of trees in more productive groves.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that we\u2019re at the bottom, and we\u2019re starting to climb back up that hill,\u201d Murphy says.",
      "A whole ecosystem of businesses dependent on Florida citrus is at risk if the crops fail, including 33,000 fulltime and part-time jobs and an economic impact of $6.8 billion in Florida alone. Besides growers, there are juice processors, grove caretakers, fertilizer sellers, packing houses, nurseries and candy manufacturers, all hoping for a fix for citrus greening disease.",
      "Tom Davidson, whose parents founded Davidson of Dundee Citrus Candy and Jelly Factory in Lake Wales in 1966, says the drop in citrus production has impacted what flavor jellies the business is able to produce and the prices it charges to customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that the scientists can get this figured out so we can we can get back to what we did,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "Researchers have been working for eight years on a genetically modified tree that can kill the tiny insects responsible for citrus greening. The process involves inserting a gene into a citrus tree that produces a protein that can kill baby Asian citrus psyllids by making holes in their guts, according to Lukasz Stelinski, an entomology professor at the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' Citrus Research and Education Center.",
      "It could be at least three years before bug-resistant trees can be planted, leaving Florida growers looking for help from other technologies. They include planting trees inside protective screens and covering young trees with white bags to keep out the bugs, injecting trees with an antibiotic, and finding trees that have become resistant to greening through natural mutation and distributing them to other groves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a Lions fan before the Detroit Lions started to win games,\u201d Stelinski says. \u201cI'm hoping that we are making that turnaround.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Trump administration's recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers.",
      "In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans.",
      "\u201cThis especially hurts anyone who\u2019s lost their jobs, including federal workers,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \u201cA few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\u201d",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Here's some guidance for those with student loans.",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \u201cget a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\u201cTry saying something like, \u2018I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I\u2019m entitled to under the law,\u2019\u201d Ba\u00f1ez said. \u201c\u2018Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower\u2019s financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\u201cYou can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\u201d she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was a less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\u201cIt's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\u201d said Fugate, 42. \u201cAnd it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\u201d",
      "As of February, Fugate notified that her application was received and she had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\u201cAnd when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\u201d she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don\u2019t do it for the glory,\u201d she said. \u201cI've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\u201d",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\u201cI was months away from ending this nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think that's going to happen. I\u2019m kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re dealing with the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s absolutely scary.\u201d",

      "In response to a question about whether his tariffs caused the turmoil in the markets, Trump said: \u201cBiden gave us a horrible economy. He gave us horrible inflation. And I think the market was going to go very, very bad. If anything, I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessmen. They're not investing because of what I've done.\u201d",
      "On whether he thinks there will be a recession: \u201cI don't see it at all. I think this country's going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater. Remember, Trump is always right.\u201d"

      "BEIJING -- U.S. President Donald Trump threw a curve ball at China by linking the fentanyl issue to his tariffs on imports. The Chinese government is swinging back.",
      "First it issued a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China. Then, the Chinese foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing's goodwill with tariffs. And this week, Chinese officials expressed their indignation at a rare background briefing with journalists.",
      "\u201cIn the spirit of humanity, China assisted the U.S. in various ways,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi told journalists last week in an annual appearance before the media. \"The U.S. should not meet good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs. No responsible major country should do that.\u201d",
      "Trump cited the fentanyl issue as the reason for imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports in early February, on top of any existing duties. He doubled that to 20% earlier this month. He also has cited fentanyl, along with other reasons, for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
      "In his executive order on the first 10% tariff, Trump accused China of subsidizing chemical companies to export fentanyl and related \u201cprecursor chemicals\u201d and of providing a safe haven for Chinese criminal organizations that launder the revenues from the opioid trade.",
      "It's not unusual for the Chinese government to subsidize industries, and the precursor chemicals are also used to make legal painkillers. But some of the production finds it way to Mexican drug cartels who make fentanyl and send it to the United States.",
      "\u201cDespite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels,\u201d the statement said, referring to China by the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China, its official name.",
      "The Chinese government hit back both times Trump imposed tariffs with its own duties on selected U.S. products and other measures aimed at American companies. Analysts have described the response as a measured one designed to try to avoid an escalation of the trade war, which could deal a blow to an already sluggish Chinese economy.",
      "The government's report on its fentanyl-related actions said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",
      "China is committed to cooperation, the report said, \u201cbut firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.\"",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, cooperation on fentanyl was relaunched in early 2024 after falling victim to geopolitics in 2022. In August of that year, a visit to Taiwan by a top U.S. legislator, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, angered China, and the government responded by cutting off talks on a range of issues including drug control.",
      "A rapprochement in late 2023, negotiated over several months, led to a meeting on fentanyl in January of last year. Drug enforcement, like climate, was held up as an area where the two countries could cooperate despite growing differences and their military, economic and technological competition.",
      "Now Trump, back in the White House after a four-year hiatus, is trying to shift the playing field in the U.S.-China relationship. So far, China has indicated it won't blink.",
      "\u201cIf the American side goes further down this wrong path, we will fight to the end,\u201d Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said last week.",

      "LONDON -- A lawyer argued Thursday that global mining giant BHP Group should be held liable for Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster 10 years ago when a dam collapse poured tons of toxic mining waste into a major waterway that killed 19 people and devastated villages.",
      "High Court Justice Finola O\u2019Farrell said she would rule later in the class action case in which claimants are seeking 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages from Australia-based BHP. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP\u2019s two main legal entities was based in London at the time.",

      "A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.",
      "Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.",
      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",
      "\u201cMalcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it\u2019s important not to \u201cget ahead\u201d of the question of responding to the ceasefire proposal. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting \u201cdetailed information\u201d about it from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that first before it can take a position.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the 30-day ceasefire would allow the sides \u201cto fully prepare a step-by-step plan for ending the war, including security guarantees for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Technical questions over how to effectively monitor a truce along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where small but deadly drones are a common sight, are \u201cvery important,\u201d Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Wednesday.",

The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that\u2019s has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.",
      "The American military help is vital for Ukraine\u2019s shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia\u2019s bigger military force at bay.

      "His comments came amid intensifying Russian effort to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region that has yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told The Associated Press.

      "The European Union has announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense trans-Atlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth around 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will also be hit, as they were during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. Yet the tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which is also on the list.",
      "Spirits producers have in essence become collateral damage in the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move \u201cis deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,\u201d said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc \u201cwill always remain open to negotiation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,\u201d she said. The commission manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 EU member countries.",
      "\u201cWe firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,\u201d von der Leyen said.",
      "Trump said that his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: \u201cJobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,\u201d she said.",
      "The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures \u201cwill only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,\u201d the chamber said Wednesday.",
      "Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.",
      "This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls \u201crebalancing measures,\u201d which the EU had from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.",
      "EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d traveled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.",
      "He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip \u201cthat the EU is not the problem.\"",
      "\u201cI argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.",
      "The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports.",
      "The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.",

      "A lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission says the agency needs to seek a trial delay in a case against Amazon due to staffing and budgetary challenges",
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\u201cOur resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\u201d Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\u201d",
      "When the judge asked if the agency\u2019s challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \u201cFork in the road\u201d email sent by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \u201cmove the trial back more than a couple of months,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \u201cracing at considerable cost\u201d to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \u201can abandoned USAID facility,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \u201cthings are going to be different in two months\u201d with the issues the agency is experiencing.",

      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to keep the date\" for the trial, Hueston said.",
      "The lawsuit, which was brought under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, alleged Amazon had enrolled consumers in the Prime program without consent and made it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets. Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",
      "This week, Amazon's Prime Video service began streaming \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the long-running TV show that boosted Trump's profile before he ran for president.

      "Before the election, Bezos defended the newspaper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate as \u201cright\u201d and \u201cprincipled.\u201d He rejected speculation that he ordered the non-endorsement to protect his business interests.",

      "He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \u201creciprocal\u201d rates starting on April 2.",
      "The EU announced its own countermeasures on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was \u201capplying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,\u201d or about $28 billion. Those measures, which cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods, are due to take effect on April 1.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer responded by saying that the EU was punishing America instead of fixing what he viewed as excess capacity in steel and aluminum production.",
      "\u201cThe EU\u2019s punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States \u2013 and indeed international security \u2013 and is yet another indicator that the EU\u2019s trade and economic policies are out of step with reality,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Meeting on Wednesday with Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump said \u201cof course\u201d he wants to respond to EU's retaliations and \u201cof course\u201d Ireland is taking advantage of the United States.",
      "\u201cThe EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canada sees itself as locked in a trade war under the pretext that its center for fentanyl smuggling and that its natural resources and factories subtract from the U.S. economy instead of supporting it.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a day to day fight. This is now the second round of unjustified tariffs leveled against Canada,\u201d said M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's foreign affairs minister. \u201cThe latest excuse is national security despite the fact that Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum adds to America\u2019s security. All the while there is a threat of further and broader tariffs on April 2 still looming. The excuse for those tariffs shifts every day.\u201d",
      "Canada is the largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States and plans to impose retaliatory tariffs of Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) starting Thursday in response to the U.S. taxes on the metals.",
      "Canada's new tariffs would be on steel and aluminum products, as well as U.S. goods including computers, sports equipment and water heaters worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion). That's in addition to the 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump import taxes that he\u2019s partially delayed by a month.",
      "Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable a day earlier that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\u201cThe higher it goes, the more likely it is they\u2019re going to build,\u201d Trump told the group. \u201cThe biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That\u2019s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\u201d",
      "Trump on Tuesday had threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but he chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Democratic lawmakers dismissed Trump's claims that his tariffs are about national security and drug smuggling, saying they're actually about generating revenues to help cover the cost of his planned income tax cuts for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump knows his policies could wreck the economy, but he\u2019s doing it anyway,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cWhy are they doing all these crazy things that Americans don\u2019t like? One reason, and one reason alone: tax breaks for billionaires, the north star of the Republican party\u2019s goals.",
      "In many ways, the president is addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Outside forecasts by the Yale University Budget Lab, Tax Policy Center and others suggest that U.S. families would have the costs of the taxes passed onto them in the form of higher prices.",
      "With Wednesday's tariffs on steel and aluminum, Trump is seeking to remedy his original 2018 import taxes that were eroded by exemptions.",
      "After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn\u2019t find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the United States, they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials.",
      "Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase to their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it\u2019s the time to expand that assembly line?\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "The top steel exporters to the U.S. are Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and Japan, with exports from Taiwan and Vietnam growing at a fast pace, according to the International Trade Administration. Imports from China, the world's largest steel producer, account for only a small fraction of what the U.S. buys.",
      "The lion's share of U.S. aluminum imports comes from Canada."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders.",

      "Now, safety experts and family members who lost loved ones in the Jan. 29 crash are asking why no one acted in the face of what appeared to be a looming disaster.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said airplane pilots were alerted to take evasive action to avoid hitting helicopters at least once a month from 2011 through 2024, citing data compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration, and that there were 85 near misses when aircraft were within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other during recent years.",

Meanwhile, repairs are envisioned to the Trop, including replacing its roof shredded by Hurricane Milton, that would have it ready for the 2026 season.",
      "Under their current contract with the city of St. Petersburg, the Rays would play three more seasons at their existing ballpark after it is repaired. Beyond that, the team\u2019s future in the Tampa Bay area is uncertain.

      "The proposed 30,000-seat stadium is a signature piece of a broader $6.5 billion revitalization project known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which refers to a predominantly Black neighborhood that was forced out by construction of the Trop and an interstate highway spur.",

      "TOKYO -- It's only two games to start the Major League Baseball season \u2014 the World Series-champion Dodgers against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome.",
      "For the record, the MLB regular season consists of almost 2,500 games.",
      "But it's much more for Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan. And for Shohei Ohtani and the four other Japanese players competing at home for the Dodgers and Cubs.",
      "Then there's MLB, which opens its regular season for the second straight year in the Asian market. A year ago it was Seoul, South Korea, where the Dodgers and San Diego Padres split two games. It was also where the betting scandal broke around Ohtani's interpreter.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to tell if this is the golden age for Japanese players in the United States,\u201d Ohtani said Friday, speaking through an interpreter, as both teams trained at the Tokyo Dome.",
      "\u201cI know there's been a lot of Japanese players that came before me,\" Ohtani added. \"But having five (Japanese players) is a big deal. It's truly a big deal.\u201d",
      "Asked what he was most looking forward to, Ohtani replied: \u201cEating good food, getting over the jetlag, and just being able to enjoy playing the game.\u201d",
      "It's a homecoming for Roberts, who was born on Japan's southern island of Okinawa to a Japanese mother and an American father. He's expecting relatives to attend from Okinawa, where last year he was honored by officials there.",
      "\u201cFor me it's personal because I get to represent my mom's side of the family,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI have a lot of relatives and family that can watch this baseball game \u2014 watch a Dodgers game at night instead of having to watch us in the morning.\u201d",
      "The time difference between Japan and the American east coast is 13 hours, and Japan is 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles.",
      "Japan is Dodgers country, swept away by Ohtani, the World Series title, and pitchers Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki. They are expected to be the Dodgers starters against the Cubs",
      "\u201cI think our mission was accomplished painting the counry of Japan in Dodgers blue,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Yamamoto and Ohtani talked about the joy of being home, as did Cubs pitcher Shota Imanaga and Seiya Suzuki, the likely DH. Imanaga is expected to start against Yamamoto in the first game.",
      "\u201cI hope my teammates are really enjoying Japan right now,\u201d Ohtani said. \"But also I hope the fans get to see my teammates enjoying Japan.\u201d",
      "Ohtani was reminded that he has not thrown a bullpen session in several weeks as he hopes to return to pitching after missing out last season following elbow surgery.",
      "\u201cI want to prioritize the hitting aspect as we're getting into the season, to give a little breather mentally and physically to the pitching side of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is according to plan and I'm pleased with how things have been going.\u201d",
      "For Sasaki, it's different. The 23-year-old signed with the Dodgers two months ago and needs to prove himself, though many feel he's a can't-miss prospect.",
      "\u201cI literally was in Japan until a couple of months ago,\u201d he said through an interpreter. \u201cFor me it\u2019s more about being able to pitch in a different uniform on a differnt team and make sure I do perform at my best.\u201d",
      "Sasaki met Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday in his office and gave him an autographed Dodgers cap. He was accompanied by Dodgers owner Mark Walter.",
      "\"I\u2019m truly happy that the Dodgers are opening the season in Japan,\u201d Japanese media reported Ishiba as saying.",
      "Cubs manager Craig Counsell talked about a party thrown Thursday by Imanaga and Suzuki to welcome the other Cubs to Japan. For most it's the first visit.",
      "What impressed Counsell was a large tuna that was carved up in a ceremony at the party. Sashimi and sushi for all.",
      "\u201cWe had tuna cut open,\" Counsell said. \"Some of the players participated in that, which was scary for a second with players with knives in their hands. But other than that it was great.\u201d",
      "Counsell said the trip to Japan was about \u201ckizuna,\u201d which is the Japanese word for bonding. He's obviously been schooled by his Japanese players.",
      "\u201cThat started for our team last night with the great party and being able to be together,\u201d Counsell said.",

      "The Jets' new regime of general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn said on Feb. 13 that they informed Rodgers they were moving on without him.

His 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing last year both rank third for a single season in franchise history. But he lacked some mobility early in his return and then dealt with a few additional leg injuries, including a significant hamstring ailment that hobbled him.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton racing a Ferrari for the first time. Reigning world champion Max Verstappen arriving without a lot of mileage in his Red Bull. Lando Norris helping McLaren set a benchmark with his pace in testing.",
      "Formula 1 is expecting a hyper-competitive milestone 75th anniversary season in 2025, and it starts this weekend with the Australian Grand Prix. There\u2019s no shortage of unknowns in terms of the pecking order, and the weather.",
      "Most of the headlines ahead of Sunday\u2019s Australian GP have revolved around Hamilton\u2019s move to Ferrari from Mercedes.",
      "The normally relaxed pre-event news conference at Albert Park was overflowing with journalists and photographers on Thursday to hear from a rejuvenated Hamilton about how much he\u2019s enjoying the prancing horse-ride.",
      "The 40-year-old British driver is going into his 19th season in F1 but has had a different outlook since his first day in January at the Scuderia\u2019s Maranello HQ, where he's teammates with Charles Leclerc.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really approach this role with pressure,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI think over the years, the pressure I put on myself has always been 10 times higher than any other pressure that could be put upon me. I haven\u2019t joined this team and been made to feel any pressure.",
      "\u201cI have an expectation for myself \u2014 I know what I can bring. I know what I can deliver. And I know what it\u2019s going to take.\u201d",
      "Norris has been trying to downplay his long-run pace that impressed the paddock during pre-season testing in Bahrain last month and made McLaren an early-season favorite.",
      "\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of expectation,\u201d Norris said. \u201cIt was just my one race run I did that kind of just made everyone believe this quite heavily. It was a good race run, but it was also in the most perfect conditions.\"",
      "He tried to temper expectations by saying McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri 's run the following day \u201cwas a lot slower.\u201d \u201cNot because he drove worse,\" Norris explained, \u201cbut simply because the conditions on the final day were considerably slower.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no denying, though, that McLaren is confident going into the opening race of the season, even if they\u2019re not quite sure of their ultimate pace.",
      "\u201cNo one really knows what to expect,\u201d said Piastri, who is aiming to become the first Aussie to win the Australian F1 Grand Prix.",
      "\u201cTesting went pretty well, but you don\u2019t know where everybody stands. I think we\u2019re pretty happy with how our test went, but Melbourne is a completely different track to Bahrain. Weather is going to be different to Bahrain and different every hour, by the look of it.\u201d",
      "Ferrari took the contest to long-time rival McLaren in the second practice as Leclerc closed out the session on top, just over one-tenth of a second ahead of Piastri and Norris",
      "Leclerc and Norris traded fastest times throughout the late afternoon run, with their pace witnessed by 125,548 people at the leafy inner-city Albert Park circuit, a record Friday crowd for the Australian Grand Prix.",
      "Hamilton had a much stronger second session for Ferrari, with the seven-time world champion finishing fifth, just over fourth-tenths behind teammate Leclerc.",
      "Red Bull\u2019s second team, Racing Bulls, shaded the main squad, with Yuki Tsunoda and Isack Hadjar showing surprising speed to end the session in fourth and sixth.",
      "World champion Max Verstappen could do no better than seventh, almost a half-second behind in the second session. Haas rookie Oliver Bearman didn't enter the second practice after his crash in the morning session.",
      "The final practice will precede Saturday qualifying, which starts at 4 p.m. local time (0500 GMT).",
      "Piastri, born and bred in Melbourne, is correct. The southern Australian city is set to deliver this weekend on the famous \u201cfour seasons in one day\u201d expression that often describes Melbourne's ever-changeable weather.",
      "The Albert Park circuit should be comfortable for F1\u2019s opening practice sessions on Friday, with a partly cloudy day expected and a top of 27 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit). Temperatures are expected to rise to 37C (98F) on Saturday for qualifying and then drop again again for the race on Sunday, when there's also rain on the forecast.",
      "A wet race would certainly mix things up, with teams needing to guess on setup following two days of dry running.",
      "Verstappen, though, whose Red Bull team did the least mileage in pre-season testing, says he\u2019s prepared for any conditions.",
      "\u201cI would like it to be dry because it\u2019s just nicer, (and) also for the fans,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s wet. It\u2019s fine as well.\"",
      "Piastri won\u2019t be the only Aussie on the Melbourne grid. Jack Doohan, the son of five-time motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan, is starting his first full season with Alpine \u2013 which appears to have taken a significant step forward over its 2024 pace.",
      "Although speculation through pre-season has been whether Doohan will keep that seat, with his French team bringing in former Williams driver Franco Colapinto as a reserve.",
      "\u201cI have a contract for at least this year, if not more,\u201d said Doohan, who is one of six rookies this season, the most on the F1 grid since 2001. \u201cAnd the uncertainties? You don\u2019t bother worrying about them. I think I have to perform each and every time I\u2019m in the car.\u201d",
      "Ferrari secured a 1-2 finish in Melbourne last year led by Sainz, just two weeks after an appendectomy that sidelined him in Saudi Arabia. But the 30-year-old Sainz will likely be fighting for points and not podiums this time around now that he\u2019s at Williams.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to do my best to score (points) as soon as possible,\u201d Sainz said.",
      "Ferrari is the most successful team in Australia with 14 GP wins, dating back to Adelaide in 1987. Hamilton is one of five drivers on the current F1 grid to have won in Melbourne, with his victories in 2008 and 2015.",
      "Sunday\u2019s season opener will be the 39th World Championship Australian Grand Prix, and the 28th in Melbourne. It starts at 3 p.m. local time (0400 GMT).",

      "Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson after four years of repeatedly rebuilding rosters at his alma mater",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson on Thursday after four years of repeatedly rebuilding rosters at his alma mater without coming close to an NCAA Tournament appearance.",
      "It was a fleeting accomplishment for a program that has fallen behind in the rugged and expanded Big Ten.",
      "Johnson had two seasons remaining on his contract, which calls for a $2.92 million buyout. His annual salary was $1.95 million, the lowest in the 18-team league.",
      "The Gophers finished 15-17 after losing to Northwestern on Wednesday in the first round of the conference tournament. Athletic director Mark Coyle announced his decision early Thursday after a late-night meeting with Johnson upon the team's return from Indianapolis. The university posted the news on its website at 1:07 a.m. local time and on social media at 1:19 a.m.",
      "\u201cI thanked him for his dedication and for guiding the program, one he cares deeply about, for the last four years. Ben is a terrific person, and we wish him well,\u201d Coyle said in a statement distributed by the school. \u201cThese decisions are difficult and are made after careful consideration and evaluation. The expectation for our program is to compete for championships, and unfortunately, we have not done that in the last four years.\u201d",
      "Coyle, who serves on the NCAA Tournament selection committee, has long desired a return to relevancy in March for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams. He worked previously at Kentucky and Syracuse, two campuses with long histories of hardwood success.",
      "\u201cThis is an extremely desirable job in one of the best conferences and cities in the nation, and we fully expect to compete at the highest level on and off the court,\" Coyle said. \"We provide a world-class experience for our student-athletes, have one of the best practice facilities in the nation and play games in a historic venue. We offer everything that is needed to be successful, and we will immediately begin a nationwide search for our next men\u2019s basketball coach.\u201d",
      "Minnesota went 56-71 under Johnson, including 22-57 in league play. The only team worse during that span was Washington, which just completed its first season as one of the Big Ten\u2019s four West Coast additions.",
      "The 44-year-old Johnson, who replaced Richard Pitino after previously serving five seasons as an assistant on his staff, was hired as a first-time head coach following three years as an assistant at Xavier. Johnson saw the top seven scorers from the 2020-21 team depart, coinciding with the NCAA\u2019s new transfer rules that allowed players to switch schools without having to sit out a season. Only two of 15 players from Pitino\u2019s last squad stayed, and the Gophers went 13-17.",
      "They bottomed out at 9-22 overall and 2-17 in the Big Ten in 2022-23, before making strides in 2023-24 with a spot in the NIT and a 19-15 finish. Their 9-11 conference record, though merely tied for ninth place, was significant considering Minnesota has hit the 10-win mark in Big Ten play just once in the last 20 years.",
      "But the advent of name, image and likeness earnings for college athletes threw yet another roadblock at Johnson\u2019s attempt to establish an identity and maintain some continuity, as programs with richer collectives lured key players away.",
      "Dawson Garcia, a second team All-Big Ten pick, stayed loyal for less and produced a stellar fifth season. But Pharrel Payne, another Minnesota native who would\u2019ve given the Gophers a formidable frontcourt for 2024-25, transferred to Texas A&M. Only four of the top 12 players from the 2023-24 team returned.",
      "\u201cThe money piece? It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s the only thing. I\u2019m going to be honest about it,\u201d Johnson said this season. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been proud of is we have been pretty smart and wise with how we\u2019ve done this. Just in terms of return on your investment, I think we have been pretty good.\u201d",
      "There were bright spots after an 0-6 start in conference play, with back-to-back road wins on the difficult West Coast trip to USC and UCLA and home upsets of ranked foes in Michigan and Oregon.",
      "But the Gophers consistently struggled to score, particularly when opponents had an effective game plan for denying Garcia the ball or the paint, and ranked last in the conference in points per game.",
      "Attendance at 97-year-old Williams Arena has waned, with the NBA\u2019s Timberwolves a much hotter ticket for hoops in the city and plenty of other competition for entertainment dollars in a place that\u2019s far more of a pro market than a college town. Minnesota had long been the only Division I program in a state that regularly produces Division I talent, but now there\u2019s also a newcomer to Division I just down the road at St. Thomas.",

      "\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the passing of Arkansas legend Oliver Miller,\u201d Arkansas said in a social media post. \u201cA key member of the 1990 Final Four team, an SWC Hall of Famer, a first-round NBA draft pick and a true embodiment of the Razorback spirit. We love you Big O. Our thoughts are with his family.\u201d",
      "Miller was drafted by Phoenix in 1992 with the No. 22 overall pick. He went on to average 7.4 points and 5.9 rebounds for the Suns, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves. He also played in Europe, the Continental Basketball Association, the United States Basketball League and with the Harlem Globetrotters.",
      "The Raptors held a moment of silence for Miller before their home game Wednesday night against the Philadelphia 76ers. Miller was selected by Toronto as the last pick of the 1995 expansion draft.",
      "\u201cHe holds a special place in our history as a member of our inaugural team in 1995, and we are so grateful for all his contributions,\" the Raptors said on social media. \u201cWe send our deepest condolences to the Miller family.\u201d",

      "Junior Bridgeman, a basketball standout who went on to an even more successful career in business, has died at the age of 71",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Junior Bridgeman, a basketball standout who led Louisville to a Final Four, starred for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and then launched an even more successful career as a businessman with stakes in restaurants, publishing and the Bucks franchise, died Tuesday. He was 71.",
      "Bridgeman was a popular fixture in Louisville after his playing days, and Mayor Craig Greenberg announced his death, saying the city had \u201clost a kind, generous and groundbreaking legend.\u201d",
      "\"He was an All-American at U of L ... and a self-made billionaire,\" Greenberg said in a statement. \u201cYet I will most remember Junior Bridgeman for his quiet, impactful assistance to others in need\u201d as well as his love for his family and his \u201cnever-ending support for our community.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, praised his friend as a highly successful businessman and generous philanthropist who loved his alma mater and \u201cthe city he called home.\u201d",
      "According to media reports, Bridgeman suffered a medical emergency at a Louisville hotel during a fundraising event Tuesday.",
      "Tributes poured in for a man who excelled on the hardwood and in corporate boardrooms.",
      "\u201cJunior was the ultimate entrepreneur who built on his impactful 12-year NBA playing career by becoming a highly respected and successful business leader,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cHe served as a mentor to generations of NBA players and athletes across sports who were eager to learn from him about what it takes to thrive in the business world.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman, a native of East Chicago, Indiana, played for Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum at Louisville. In three seasons, he scored 1,348 points, grabbed 657 rebounds and in his senior season led the Cardinals to the 1975 Final Four, where they lost to eventual national champion UCLA in a 75-74 thriller.",
      "Bridgeman was involved in one of the biggest trades in NBA history at the start of his professional career. After the Los Angeles Lakers selected Bridgeman with the eighth pick in the 1975 draft, they sent him to Milwaukee as part of the trade that brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the West Coast.",
      "Bridgeman\u2019s 711 games played for Milwaukee ranks third in franchise history, behind only Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. His No. 2 jersey was retired by the Bucks in 1988.",
      "\u201cHis hard work and perseverance led him to become one of the nation\u2019s top business leaders and, last September, Junior\u2019s professional life came full circle when he returned to the Bucks family as an owner,\u201d the Bucks said in a statement. \u201cHis memory will always be an inspiration to the Bucks organization.\u201d",
      "The Bucks announced Bridgeman had bought a stake in the team last year at a news conference that included co-owner Jimmy Haslam, coach Doc Rivers, general manager Jon Horst and many players. Bridgeman said afterward he had a 10% stake.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to get back involved with the team in a different way and take advantage of it was something that was kind of a dream,\u201d Bridgeman said at the time.",
      "Prior to Milwaukee's game Tuesday night, Rivers said Bridgeman was a strong role model.",
      "\u201cThink about that kid growing up, wanting to be an NBA player, probably his dream, and he turned that dream into becoming an NBA owner,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe is the exact model the league should use every day when they are talking to our young players.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman played for the Bucks from 1975-84 and then spent two years with the Los Angeles Clippers before coming back to Milwaukee for his final NBA season in 1986-87. He scored 11,517 points (averaging 13.6 per game) in his career. He ranks seventh in Bucks history in field goals (4,142), ninth in points (9,892) and 10th in minutes (18,054).",
      "After his playing days, Bridgeman turned that same drive into a successful business career.",
      "\u201cWhile his play on the court was exceptional, it was as a leader in the business community that Junior truly excelled,\u201d University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel said in a statement.",
      "Bridgeman was a longtime franchisee for Wendy\u2019s and Chili\u2019s restaurants, at one time operating more than 450 locations in 20 states, the university said. He became a bottler for Coca-Cola and bought Ebony and Jet magazines, the school said.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege of playing against him, and I'll never forget how he had one of the sweetest jump shots in the NBA,\u201d retired Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson wrote on X. \u201cWhat people don't realize is Junior didn't make a fortune as a player, but he turned what he earned into something extraordinary, becoming a billionaire African American businessman in this country.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman was part of the foursome that owns Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. He also served on the boards of Churchill Downs racetrack, the University of Louisville and Fifth Third Bank, among others. He and his wife, Doris, hosted a Kentucky Derby party that served as a fundraiser.",
      "\u201cHe is the blueprint to so many current and former athletes across sports that success doesn't end when you're done playing,\u201d Johnson wrote.",
      "Besides his wife, he is survived by children Eden, Justin and Ryan.",

    "story": [
      "Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry is off to a strong start in his return to the NHL",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Tristan Jarry's career was at a crossroads in mid-January. The Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender was struggling and even worse, the franchise's faith in him appeared to be shot.",
      "Things grew so bleak for Jarry at the end of a stretch in which he dropped six straight starts that general manager Kyle Dubas \u2014 the same man who'd signed Jarry to a five-year deal shortly after taking over in the summer of 2023 \u2014 made the unusual decision to send Jarry to the minors.",
      "Not just to get some reps in, but seemingly for good.",
      "Players with two All-Star appearances and millions in the bank typically don't make their way back after a fall like that. At least not with the same team.",
      "Yet there Jarry was on Tuesday night standing inside PPG Paints Arena, turning aside 36 shots in a 3-2 overtime victory over Vegas that offered hope that while Pittsburgh's season is all but lost, Jarry's tenure with the only NHL club he's ever known might not be.",
      "Yes, those six-plus weeks in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton riding the bus to Bridgeport and Lehigh Valley were \u201ctough\u201d as he put it. They may also have been necessary.",
      "\u201cIt was something I had to work through,\u201d Jarry said. \u201cSomething I need to look at myself in the mirror and just say \u2018I need to have a better game.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Penguins called Jarry back up quietly earlier this month when 23-year-old Joel Blomqvist \u2014 potentially the club's goalie of the future \u2014 had struggles of his own during a somewhat extended NHL look.",
      "Jarry returned to the lineup on Sunday in a road victory over likely playoff-bound Minnesota. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan called Jarry \u201cspectacular\u201d while outdueling future Hall of Famer and former Penguin Marc-Andre Fleury.",
      "Sullivan saw enough to give Jarry the nod again against Pacific Division-leading Vegas, a potentially fraught assignment for a player who hasn't looked comfortable playing at home this season.",
      "Yet the jitters \u2014 particularly the early-game ones that have popped up frequently during a season in which he has allowed a first-shot goal six times \u2014 never materialized. Jarry turned aside the first puck the Golden Knights threw his way and quickly settled into the game.",
      "Vegas, which is charging toward the postseason, dominated for long stretches. Jarry responded by showcasing the athleticism that's always been there and the confidence, which admittedly hasn't.",
      "He was at his best in the third period. During one sequence Jarry turned aside a breakaway and a wraparound attempt within seconds of each other to protect a one-goal lead. When the whistle blew, the crowd that reveled in booing him in mid-winter was cheering his name instead.",
      "Though Vegas tied it late on a slap shot by Noah Hanifin, Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime to secure two points in a season in which they've been hard to come by. Jarry's uneven play is one of the major reasons the Penguins will likely miss the playoffs for a third straight year.",
      "Yet if he can find something over the next month, he could perhaps make his contract that features an average cap hit of $5 million palatable for another team to take on. Or maybe a goaltender who has been part of the problem during Pittsburgh's swoon could end up being part of the solution.",
      "\u201cHe's got a long body of work in Pittsburgh that suggests strongly that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender,\u201d Sullivan said of Jarry. \"We\u2019ve said that on many occasions ... He\u2019s made the All-Star team twice, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidence. There\u2019s substance there.\u201d",
      "Jarry needs to pair that substance with consistency and maybe a dash of toughness too. He's been around long enough \u2014 Jarry made his NHL debut nearly eight years ago \u2014 to know two solid games doesn't mean he's \u201cback.\u201d Every meaningful stat, from goals against average (3.15) to save percentage (.893), ranks as the worst of his career.",
      "There's more work to be done. Probably a lot more. Yet he finds himself in a better place than he was in mid-January. He believes being sent down freed him in a way. He had nothing left to lose, so Jarry headed to the AHL with a \u201cfree mind\" that has helped pave the way for a comeback that seemed remote not long ago.",
      "\u201cI think just over my time that I\u2019ve been playing in the NHL, I\u2019ve played a lot of good hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to continue that.\u201d",
      "Given Pittsburgh's spot in the standings and the need to get a feel once and for all whether he can reclaim the team's No. 1 goaltending spot, Jarry probably won't lack for opportunities down the stretch. What he does with them will say plenty about his future.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it didn\u2019t go the way any of us hoped (early in the season),\u201d Sullivan said. \"I think he\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s capable of, quite honestly.\u201d",

      "Former Wisconsin star Baylee Marabella had to play hockey alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area",
      "MILWAUKEE -- When Baylee Marabella got interested in ice hockey while growing up in Wisconsin, she had to play alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area.",
      "That isn\u2019t as much of a problem in hockey hotbeds such as Wisconsin anymore with a steady increase in the number of girls playing the sport. That trend helped launch the coaching career of Marabella, who was known as Baylee Wellhausen when she played on three Frozen Four teams with Wisconsin from 2014-18.",
      "Marabella now coaches Milwaukee School of Engineering, which just finished its inaugural season in Division III competition. It\u2019s one of more than two dozen D-III schools to start women\u2019s hockey teams over the last decade, capitalizing on the relative lack of cost compared to doing so in Division I.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Marabella said of the rapid growth.",
      "MSOE was one of 78 schools to play women\u2019s ice hockey this year at the Division III level, which doesn't offer athletic scholarships. That represents a 50% increase from 2015, when there were 52 schools playing the sport at this level.",
      "Marabella believes those numbers can keep going up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more girls who want to play college (hockey), so as we keep moving forward, the demand is going to be higher,\u201d Marabella said.",
      "Women\u2019s hockey in North America is on the rise and not only at the Division III level. The Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League is two months from completing its second season amid signs that attendance is up. The six-team league is drawing an average of 7,300 fans this season \u2013 up from 5,500 last year \u2013 and might expand by as many as two franchise next season.",
      "USA Hockey had 73,083 registrations among girls in 2023-24, a 47.4% increase over its 2013-14 total (49,587). Boys registrations increased by 4.8% over the same time, from 302,303 to 316,737.",
      "\u201cOverall, the skill level has gotten so much better over the years that it becomes one of those sports that was almost a no-brainer to be adding at the Division III level,\u201d said Joe Cranston, who coaches defending champion Wisconsin-River Falls, which hosts the D-III championship March 28-30. The 12-team tournament begins Saturday on campus sites.",
      "There are 44 women's hockey programs in Division I and Division II, a 12.8% rise from 2015 (39). The two divisions compete in a single national tournament, which ends this year with the Women's Frozen Four March 21-23 in Minneapolis.",
      "The modest growth at the higher level can be blamed on the bigger costs with adding a D-I program. Ice availability is a factor for any team at any level, and setting budgets is difficult for any athletic director dealing with the NCAA House settlement and name, image and likeness compensation questions.",
      "Minnesota reported operating expenses of a little over $3.6 million for women\u2019s hockey in 2023-24. Michigan released a feasibility study saying expenses would run about $4.5 million annually if it started a women\u2019s hockey program.",
      "By contrast, Wisconsin-River Falls reported $197,087 in women\u2019s hockey expenses in its 2024 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act survey.",
      "Michelle McAteer has a unique perspective, as a new commissioner of a Division I conference (the Western Collegiate Hockey Association) who finished a 14-season run coaching Division III program Augsburg last year.",
      "\u201cHockey\u2019s an expensive sport to operate, and to operate a rink is an expensive investment,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cAt the Division III level, not everyone has their own rinks on campus. You can get by playing in community rinks and renting. The facility demands at the Division I level are quite different. The investment and infrastructure are a lot more. Everything is more. They have more significant travel. They have a more significant equipment budget, the staffing differences.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s probably enough talent nowadays to accommodate more Division I programs. The difference is apparent on the ice.",
      "\u201cTen to 12 years ago, there were a lot of teams at the Division I level that might have had one good line, a line-and-a-half, maybe two,\u201d said coach Mark Johnson, whose Badgers have been the top-ranked team in women's hockey most of the season. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s got two or three lines, maybe four lines, that can compete and play at a real high level.\u201d",
      "Because the schools in larger divisions haven\u2019t added women\u2019s hockey programs at a rate that correlates with the growth in the sport at the youth level, it\u2019s created more opportunities for Division III schools.",
      "\u201cI have kids on my team who were All-Americans 15 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cKids who were Division I players 10 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now.\u201d",
      "Plattsburgh State won five titles in a six-year stretch from 2014-19, but there\u2019s been a different champion for each of the last five tournaments.",
      "Norwich won in 2018, Plattsburgh State in 2019, Middlebury in 2022, Gustavus Adolphus in 2023 and Wisconsin-River Falls last year. There were no Division III championships in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.",
      "\u201cMost years there\u2019s maybe three or four teams that could win it all,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cI think this year there\u2019s probably twice that, probably seven or eight teams that could win the whole thing.\u201d",
      "SUNY Oswego athletic director Wendy McManus, the head of the NCAA Division III women\u2019s hockey committee, says smaller schools will continue adding the sport as long as youth participation stays strong.",
      "\u201cI do think eventually it will level off,\u201d McManus said. \u201cI say that because you don\u2019t see California schools or true West Coast schools playing hockey that much. We say \u2018West\u2019 is basically Minnesota, Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "That growth has provided welcome opportunities that might not have been available a decade earlier.",
      "For instance, MSOE\u2019s roster includes forward Hannah Baumann of Wausau, Wisconsin, who said she grew up idolizing Marabella and was a big Badgers fan. Baumann used to have to drive an hour to practice because of the relative lack of girls hockey teams.",
      "There now are more girls teams than ever, and some gather in the stands for MSOE\u2019s home games. That has particular meaning for forward Helen Bechthold, who grew up in the Milwaukee area playing for one of those youth programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see they have all-girls teams playing now, because when I was playing, they didn\u2019t have all-girls teams,\u201d said Bechthold, who grew up playing with boys. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see. A lot of them were like, \u2018You played where we play\u2019 and stuff like that. That definitely makes me happy. I\u2019m happy they have that opportunity.\u201d",

      "NASA's newest space telescope has blasted off to map the entire sky like never before",
      "NASA\u2019s newest space telescope rocketed into orbit Tuesday to map the entire sky like never before \u2014 a sweeping look at hundreds of millions of galaxies and their shared cosmic glow since the beginning of time.",
      "SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth\u2019s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.",
      "The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.",
      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",
      "The telescope\u2019s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.",
      "It's like \"looking at the universe through a set of rainbow-colored glasses,\u201d said deputy project manager Beth Fabinsky of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "To keep the infrared detectors super cold \u2014 minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius) \u2014 Spherex has a unique look. It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.",
      "Besides the telescope, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun\u2019s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.",
      "The evening launch was delayed two weeks because of rocket and other issues.",

      "One student asked a search engine, \u201cWhy does my boyfriend hit me?\u201d Another threatened suicide in an email to an unrequited love. A gay teen opened up in an online diary about struggles with homophobic parents, writing they just wanted to be themselves.",
      "In each case and thousands of others, surveillance software powered by artificial intelligence immediately alerted Vancouver Public Schools staff in Washington state.",
      "Vancouver and many other districts around the country have turned to technology to monitor school-issued devices 24/7 for any signs of danger as they grapple with a student mental health crisis and the threat of shootings.",
      "The goal is to keep children safe, but these tools raise serious questions about privacy and security \u2014 as proven when Seattle Times and Associated Press reporters inadvertently received access to almost 3,500 sensitive, unredacted student documents through a records request about the district\u2019s surveillance technology.",
      "___",
      "The Education Reporting Collaborative, a coalition of eight newsrooms, is investigating the unintended consequences of AI-powered surveillance at schools. Members of the Collaborative are AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Hechinger Report, Idaho Education News, The Post and Courier in South Carolina, and The Seattle Times.",
      "___",
      "The released documents show students use these laptops for more than just schoolwork; they are coping with angst in their personal lives.",
      "Students wrote about depression, heartbreak, suicide, addiction, bullying and eating disorders. There are poems, college essays and excerpts from role-play sessions with AI chatbots.",
      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry",
      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

      "All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024.",
      "Most of the other big stocks in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year.",
      "Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks.",
      "The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon.",
      "The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came.",
      "Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12.",
      "Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses.",
      "For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example.",
      "A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak.",
      "The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse.",
      "No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain.",
      "The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns."

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- There sat Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s top health official, at a Steak \u2019n Shake with Fox News host Sean Hannity, raving about the fries.",
      "\u201cSteak \u2019n Shake has been great, we\u2019re very grateful for them,\u201d Kennedy said, in between nibbles of fries that the Midwestern franchise recently announced would be cooked in beef tallow instead of common cooking oils that Kennedy says are bad for Americans' diet.",
      "It's the kind of endorsement that doctors have implored him to make about the childhood vaccines used to prevent deadly diseases, like measles as outbreaks worsened in Texas and New Mexico during his first month in office.",
      "The secretary of Health and Human Services has, instead, raised doubts about vaccines, most recently saying in his interview with Hannity that the shots cause \u201cdeaths every year,\" although he later added that vaccinations should be encouraged.",
      "In his first month in office, Kennedy, who vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d has delivered an inconsistent message that has the nation's top infectious diseases specialists worried that his tepid recommendations of vaccines will undermine access to long-proven remedies.",
      "During his first address to thousands of workers at the federal public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the childhood vaccine schedule. Days later, the CDC cancelled a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Panel, a group of doctors and scientists who make recommendations on vaccines. That meeting has not been rescheduled.",
      "In another case, a cancelled public meeting of vaccine advisers who make recommendations on the flu vaccine every year for the FDA also has not been given a new date. This week, the National Institutes for Health, also under Kennedy's purview, began cancelling funding for some research on vaccines.",
      "The CDC also is preparing to research autism and vaccines, planning to \"leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Agency officials did not comment further for this article.",
      "Numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the two, a fact the agency states on its website.",
      "\u201cWhat he is trying to do is scare about the safety of vaccines,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser and infectious disease doctor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Kennedy's first month in office. \u201cIt shouldn't surprise anybody. His agenda has always been to get vaccines off the market, or to make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit worries that the cancellation of the FDA\u2019s flu vaccine meeting, held every March for at least 30 years, is just the beginning. The committee's June meeting to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine's formulation has also not been scheduled, he said.",
      "Democrats and Republicans pushed back when Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA nominee, wouldn\u2019t commit to rescheduling the committee's flu meeting .",
      "\u201cWhat is lost is the transparency,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee who is also a physician.",
      "During his senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly rejected any notion that he would undermine vaccines. \u201cI support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\u201d he said. He promised Cassidy, who was unsettled about Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy work, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "But Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views of vaccines have emerged during interviews and public statements since his confirmation.",
      "He's sent \u201cmixed messages\u201d on vaccine safety, even though the U.S. has \u201cthe most elaborate vaccine adverse event surveillance system in the world,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Serious problems, including death, are very rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, he said.",
      "\u201cA simple way to describe this to the average person is the serious adverse events generally occur at a rate of 1 to a few cases per million doses of vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a needle in a haystack.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com earlier this month, Kennedy said the measles outbreak in West Texas that left a six-year old child dead was a \u201ccall to action\u201d but stopped short of recommending that people receive the vaccine that prevents 97% of cases. Despite the U.S. registering its first measles death in a decade, Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed this year's outbreaks, noting that when he was a child \u201ceverybody got measles.\"",
      "This year's cases \u2014 reported at 250 \u2014 are on track to far outpace last year's reports of 286 measles infections.",
      "Pediatricians are fielding more questions from confused parents in their exam rooms, said Dr. Susan Kressly. Worried about reports of cancelled vaccine meetings, they\u2019re wondering about their access to next year\u2019s flu vaccines. Others are asking if they should get doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine earlier. Kressly said there\u2019s a clear message the government can send to help stop the rising case count.",
      "\u201cThe only way to stop an outbreak is increased coordinated positive messaging around vaccinating,\u201d Kressly said.",
      "The CDC has assisted with vaccination efforts in West Texas. But Kennedy himself has publicly advocated for an alternative treatment for measles: Vitamin A. Under his watch, the CDC\u2019s guidance was updated to say that Vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles and prescribed in doses under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",
      "Vitamin A supplementation has been recommended for decades to reduce pneumonia and death in malnourished children in developing countries, but the benefits in well-nourished children in countries like the U.S. are less clear.",
      "\u201cWe need to use Vitamin A for those kids who are unlucky enough to get measles,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Utah. \u201cBut it can\u2019t prevent measles and it can only provide some help in reducing the severity.\u201d",
      "When administered correctly, using Vitamin A in kids with severe measles will \u201cdo no harm,\u201d Pavia said. But if improperly done, high doses of Vitamin A can be toxic and deadly.",
      "Abrupt staffing changes have also dominated Kennedy's first weeks in office, with CDC pick Dave Weldon withdrawing from the nomination mere minutes before his hearing, Kennedy's top HHS spokesman quitting two weeks into the job and the Food and Drug Administration's newly minted chief counsel departing 48 hours into the position.",
      "Trump and Kennedy's supporters, however, have dismissed concerns about the rocky start.",
      "His newfound platform as health secretary and talk of healthier foods is already affecting change in the American diet, advisers close to Kennedy and Trump have claimed on social media.",
      "They credit Kennedy with prompting Republican legislators to introduce bills in Utah and Texas that would ban soda in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example. And then there's Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s new fries.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. just ate Steak \u2019n Shake on live TV, the fast food joint that\u2019s bravely frying everything in beef tallow,\u201d conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk said this week in a tweet. \u201cThis is the way.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, after a meeting with a handful of executives from the nation's largest food manufactures, Kennedy released a slickly-produced video that promised more change would be on the way, saying companies were taking his \u201cMAHA\" movement seriously.",
      "\u201cThey understand they have a new sheriff in town,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "He did not share any details about what was discussed at the meeting.",

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders."

      "Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $5 a dozen",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $6 a dozen. But the move has been delayed in part because of concerns it could jeopardize chicken exports worth billions of dollars a year.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced plans to spend $100 million to study bird flu vaccines to fight the disease in concert with meat chicken, egg and turkey groups. That's part of a larger $1 billion effort to invest in more protections to keep the virus off farms that President Donald Trump believes will help lower egg prices.",
      "Chicken meat producers remain the most resistant to vaccines because of concerns they could harm meat exports, which totaled nearly $4.7 billion last year. Egg and turkey producers sell most of their products in the U.S. and have been hit hardest by the virus.",
      "Without a new policy including vaccines, the government will continue to slaughter every flock with a bird flu infection to limit the spread of the disease. Those deaths have totaled over 166 million birds in the U.S. since 2022.",
      "Most birds killed are egg-laying chickens, and the death of so many hens is the main reason egg prices keep rising. The average price per dozen has hit $5.90, and in some part of the country, it is far higher.",
      "Poultry veterinarian Simon Shane, who runs www.Egg-News.com, said the government is hesitant to use vaccines and change its policy of killing birds largely because of the meat chicken industry's opposition.",
      "\u201cBasically this is a political issue, and this only came to a head because eggs are at $8 to $9 a dozen, and it\u2019s embarrassing the government \u2014 embarrassing the present administration,\u201d Shane said.",
      "Before using vaccinations, the government must decide how to devise an effective system and monitor for outbreaks within vaccinated flocks that might not show any symptoms, said John Clifford, the USDA's former longtime chief veterinary officer, who now works with a poultry industry export group. Once that is figured out, the industry can negotiate with countries to minimize trade problems.",
      "\u201cWhat the industry wants is the ability to develop the strategic plan to share that with the trading partners and then find out what kind of impact that that will have on trade,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "There are fears that vaccinating could allow the virus to linger undetected in flocks and mutate in ways that could make it more of a threat to humans and allow sick birds to get into the food supply. Like with other diseases, properly cooking chicken to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) will kill bird flu, but the industry and chicken buyers don't want it there at all.",
      "For meat chicken, known as broilers, the virus isn't as significant because those birds are slaughtered at 6 to 8 weeks old and thus have less chance of being infected compared with egg-laying hens, which live to 2 years or older. Also most broilers are raised in the Southeast, which hasn't had as many outbreaks as the Midwest and West.",
      "Another delay to vaccinating concerns distribution. Egg farmers want to administer it through chicken feed or water, saying it's not practical to give shots to millions of birds in a single barn.",
      "It can also be difficult to tell the difference between a vaccinated bird and one that has been sick with the virus. That would make other countries nervous about importing meat.",
      "\u201cPeople have talked about how expensive it would be to monitor vaccinated populations. And it would be. But where do we want to spend our money?\u201d said Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our money hand over fist right now in depopulation and to buy eggs for breakfast.\u201d",
      "China and Mexico have been vaccinating their poultry for years, but they take different approaches.",
      "In Mexico chicken are vaccinated, but Clifford said the country doesn't slaughter flocks when infections are found. That basically ensures the virus is present in poultry.",
      "China still slaughters vaccinated flocks when infections are found, which has proven more effective at limiting the spread of the virus and reigning in outbreaks.",
      "Clifford said the U.S. would need to continue culling flocks with outbreaks even after vaccinating, and it might make sense to give shots only to egg layers and turkeys, not broilers.",
      "Don't expect big relief anytime soon.",
      "The USDA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article sent last week, clearly isn't moving to vaccinate immediately. And, regardless, it will take time to raise new hens.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait to replace those with new hatched chicks, and it takes 20 weeks before they even start laying,\u201d Shane said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get the eggs from.\u201d",
      "Prices may ease somewhat later this year after peak demand, which happens around Easter, if massive egg farms in Iowa, Ohio, California and elsewhere can avoid more outbreaks.",
      "The USDA has predicted that average egg prices will be 41% higher than the 2024 average of $3.17 per dozen. That would mean $4.47 per dozen, slightly below the current average."

      "The total number of dabbling and diving ducks is down about 30% from 2017, said Brasher. Loss of grasslands habitat and a prolonged drought affecting the wetlands of the Great Plains\u2019 prairie pothole region have taken a toll. Among all waterfowl, numbers are down 20% since 2014, the report found.",
      "The latest report is a collaboration between several groups including Cornell University, Ducks Unlimited, American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society and the American Ornithological Society.",
      "The work draws on survey data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and citizen projects such as Cornell's eBird. There are some 2,000 bird species in North America. A third of the species examined are rated as high or moderate concern for conservation due to declining numbers, habitat loss or other threats.",

      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

      "Nissan Motor Corp. recently showcased its driverless technology on city streets in Yokohama",
      "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- The van makes its way slowly but surely through the city streets, braking gently when a car swerves into its lane. But its steering wheel is turning on its own, and there's no one in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",
      "Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car \u2014 simply because it knows cars better.",
      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",
      "Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nation\u2019s shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers.",
      "Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology.",
      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissan's autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. recently showed its very own \u201ccity\u201d or living area for its workers and partnering startups, near Mount Fuji, being built especially to test various technology, including autonomous driving.",
      "Progress has been cautious.",
      "University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because it\u2019s human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes.",
      "\u201cIn human driving, the driver takes responsibility. It\u2019s so clear. But nobody is driving so you don\u2019t know who will take responsibility,\u201d Igarashi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service \u2014 restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Nissan says its technology is safe. After all, a human can\u2019t be looking at the front, the back and all around at the same time. But the driverless car can, with all its sensors.",
      "When a system failure happened during the recent demonstration, the car just came to a stop and all was well.",
      "Phil Koopman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started.",
      "The main problem is what\u2019s known as \u201cedge cases,\u201d those rare but dangerous situations that the machine has not yet been taught to respond to. Using autonomous fleets of a significant size for some time is needed for such edge cases to be learned, he said.",
      "\u201cWe will see each city require special engineering efforts and the creation of a special remote support center. This will be a city-by-city deployment for many years,\u201d said Koopman.",

The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France.",
      "The latest auto sales figure from China show that Tesla sales there have been nearly halved from February a year ago, although the decline is largely due increased competition from domestic EV companies.",

      "Dragon is transporting the Crew-10 team made up of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, the mission's commander; NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, the mission pilot; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi; and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, with Roscosmo, Russia's space agency.",
      "Crew-10 will relieve four astronauts who are part of the current station crew, including Williams and Wilmore. The two astronauts planned to spend about a week on the ISS, but that brief stop turned into a nine-month mission when NASA determined that it was unsafe to bring them home on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they rode into orbit.",
      "The duo arrived at the ISS in early June, but in September, NASA opted to bring the Starliner back home empty due to concerns about technical issues with the craft. This mission marked Boeing's first crewed flight of the Starliner. An empty Starliner landed safely back on Earth on Sept. 6.",
      "The two American astronauts became part of the ISS Crew-9 team and have been actively engaged in research and maintenance of the station ever since. The extended time in space also allowed Williams to break the record for the most spacewalking time by a woman, with 62 hours and 6 minutes in the vacuum of space.",
      "NASA has long insisted that Williams and Wilmore were never stuck or stranded.",
      "In September, three months after the pair arrived at the ISS, a Roscosmos Soyuz spacecraft arrived at the station with two cosmonauts and an American astronaut. Several weeks later, American astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov arrived at the station onboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon Freedom spacecraft. Both vehicles have remained docked to the ISS and available for emergencies ever since.",
      "The SpaceX Crew Dragon Freedom capsule that brought Hague and Gorbunov to the ISS is currently docked at the station will be the one that brings Williams, Wilmore and the two other Crew-9 astronauts back home. Endurance will remain docked at the station along with the Soyuz.",
      "There is a period of overlap when the new team and the current crew of seven work collaboratively to ensure a smooth handover. NASA has said Williams and Wilmore could be home as soon as Wednesday.",
      "NASA said that Crew-10 will conduct more than 200 scientific experiments and technology demonstrations during their mission to help humans eventually go deeper into space.",

It's unclear if Musk was personally involved in sending the letter, and he has not addressed it on his social media platform, X.",

The minority leader's announcement amounted to a major break from House Democrats who voted nearly unanimously against the GOP funding bill earlier this week.",

      "\"I cannot urge enough how bad of an idea it is to empower and enable Donald Trump and Elon Musk in this moment. It is dangerous and it is reckless,\" she said.",

But the House would have to come back into session to pass the 30-day stopgap bill they are in support of. Ocasio-Cortez dismissed the idea that calling House members back would be a problem.",
      "\"House Democrats are in town. I mean, are we afraid of working? Is that the problem here? That the idea that, God forbid, members of Congress have to fly back and do their jobs? I mean, genuinely -- come on,\" AOC said on CNN.",

      "\"Every single House Democrat, including every single House Democrat who won a Trump district, except for one out of over 200 voted against this deeply partisan, extreme Republican spending bill \u2026 in terms of Democratic leadership in the House. We've seen that result in the House, I think it's time that we see similar results in the Senate,\" she added.",

      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, faced a confirmation hearing Friday before the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Oz, a doctor and former television host whose nomination to lead CMS has put him in the political spotlight for the first time since his unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat three years ago, faced tough questions from Democrats on the 27-member committee, which will vote whether to move his nomination to a floor vote in front of the entire Senate.",
      "Oz talked about his accomplishments as a physician and TV host during his opening statement, noting the 10 Emmys his show won, and contended Trump \"wants to love and cherish Medicare and Medicaid.\"",
      "\"We have a generational opportunity to fix our health care system and help people stay healthy for longer,\" he said Friday.",
      "Oz said his main goals as the head of CMS deal with more transparency and eliminating waste, echoing Trump's goals.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the committee, however, slammed Oz during his introduction, calling him out over his past comments and actions. Wyden, D-Ore., noted Oz has had a history of promoting Medicare Advantage companies and baseless wellness remedies and claimed if confirmed the nominee would \"coddle the for profit insurance companies.\"",
      "\"Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays,\" he said.",

      "\"Well, then, you're going to need to reject the Republican budget,\" Hassan responded.",

      "A study Oz cited at the time was later retracted, and an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found the data behind the product was \"deeply flawed.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in particular, has been increasingly vocal ahead of the hearing about Oz's financial ties to health care companies that he will now oversee in his role at CMS and his past comments about privatizing Medicare, one of the programs he'll manage.",
      "She also criticized what she calls his \"hostile record\" on abortion rights, referring to Oz's comments on the campaign trail that a woman's decision to get an abortion should be made by her, her doctor and \"local political leaders.\"",

      "The amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, only allowing exceptions to pay for the procedure when the life of the mother is at risk or the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Medicaid, for example, does not cover abortion services beyond those exceptions \u2014 though some states use their own funds to do so.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, argued that Biden took action to expand abortion access in ways that were \"explicitly in violation of the Hyde Amendment.\"",
      "\"If you're confirmed, will you commit to upholding the Hyde Amendment and ensuring that our federal health care programs are not providing abortions on the taxpayers' dime?\" he asked Oz.",
      "The nominee said he would.",
      "\"The implication that elected officials should be involved in a woman's personal health treatment decision is terrifying and antithetical to patient health,\" Warren wrote to Oz on Thursday.",
      "Oz also came under fire over his tax returns after Democrats said that he underpaid on Social Security and Medicare taxes by using a limited liability loophole.",
      "\"Dr. Oz's position is counter to the position of the Department of Treasury and results in him not paying into Social Security and Medicare, the very healthcare program he hopes to manage,\" Democratic Senate Finance Committee staff wrote in the memo, circulated to the committee.",
      "\"He avoided hundreds of thousands of dollars in Social Security and Medicare taxes in the years reviewed,\" the staff wrote. They reviewed Oz's taxes from 2021 to 2023.",
      "The committee staff reviewed Oz's tax returns and met with the nominee, his accountant and his lawyers earlier in March. Oz and his team maintained that he was not liable for the taxes the Democrats said he owed, according to the memo.",
      "Oz in the past has expressed support for Medicare Advantage, a Medicare-approved plan run by private insurance companies. The plan must follow rules set by Medicare, such as limiting out-of-pocket expenses and covering all services covered by traditional Medicare.",
      "\"Medicare Advantage has definitely become a much more important part of the Medicare program. It's now the most popular coverage option within the program,\" Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at the right-leaning think tank Paragon Health Institute, told ABC News.",

      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, a political legend whose quick wit bridged partisan gaps in the years before today\u2019s political acrimony, has died. He was 93.",
      "Simpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, a group of museums where he was a board member for 56 years.",
      "\u201cHe was an uncommonly generous man,\u201d Pete Simpson, his older brother, said in the statement. \u201cAnd I mean generous in an absolutely unconditional way. Giving of his time, giving of his energy \u2014 and he did it in politics and he did it in the family, forever.\u201d",
      "Along with former Vice President Dick Cheney, Simpson was a towering Republican figure from Wyoming, the least-populated state. Unlike Cheney, Simpson was famous for his humor.",
      "\u201cWe have two political parties in this country, the Stupid Party and the Evil Party. I belong to the Stupid Party,\u201d was among Simpson\u2019s many well-known quips.",
      "A political moderate by current standards, Simpson\u2019s three terms as senator from 1979 to 1997 covered the Republican Party\u2019s rejuvenation under President Ronald Reagan. Simpson played a key role rallying GOP senators around the party\u2019s legislative agenda as a top Senate leader during that time.",
      "Simpson was better known for holding his own views, though, with sometimes caustic certainty. A deficit hawk with sharp descriptions of people who relied on government assistance, Simpson supported abortion rights \u2014 an example of moderation that contributed to his fade in the GOP.",
      "His Democratic friends included Robert Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Norman Mineta, transportation secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "Simpson and Mineta met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson\u2019s hometown of Cody, Wyoming, during World War II.",
      "After leaving politics, both promoted awareness of the incarceration of some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in camps during the war. Mineta, who died in 2022, recalled that Simpson once was asked what was the biggest difference between them as a Republican and a Democrat.",
      "\u201cAlan thought about it and he said, \u2018Well, I wear size 15 shoes and he wears a size 8 and a half,\u2019\u201d Mineta replied, according to the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.",
      "Simpson was \u201cgifted in crossing party lines and building bipartisan consensus,\" Colin Simpson, one of his three children and a former Wyoming House speaker, said in the statement.",
      "\u201cDad and Pete have anchored the extended Simpson family for decades with the same love, humor, compassion and dedication their parents did before them,\" he said. \u201cDad was a mighty force and with Mom\u2019s steady hand by his side we are so blessed and proud to have been along for the ride of a lifetime.\u201d",
      "In 2010, President Barack Obama tasked Simpson with co-leading a debt-reduction commission that developed a plan to save $4 trillion through tax hikes and spending cuts. The plan lacked support for serious consideration by Congress.",
      "At 6-foot-7, Simpson was literally a towering figure \u2014 tallest on record in the Senate until Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who is 6-foot-9, took office in 2017.",
      "Big as Simpson\u2019s shoes were, he had huge ones to fill politically.",
      "His father, Milward Simpson, was a governor, U.S. senator and state legislator. His mother, Lorna Kooi Simpson, was president of the Red Cross in Cody and on the local planning commission.",
      "\u201cI saw Dad loved politics and the law, and I wanted to do that,\u201d Simpson once said.",
      "Simpson was born in Denver in 1931. After a childhood of reckless gun-shooting and vandalism in Cody that put him in danger and in trouble with the law, he graduated from Cody High School in 1949 and the University of Wyoming in 1954.",
      "Also that year he married Ann Schroll, of Greybull, Wyoming, and joined the U.S. Army, where he served in the Fifth Infantry Division and the Second Armored \u201cHell on Wheels\u201d Division in Germany.",
      "Alan and Ann Simpson celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary with a community ice cream social attended by relatives and hundreds of others in a Cody park last summer.",
      "After leaving the Army, Simpson got a law degree from the University of Wyoming in 1958 and joined his father\u2019s law practice, where he worked for the next 19 years. He was elected to the Wyoming House in 1964 and served there until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976.",
      "A football and basketball athlete at the University of Wyoming, Simpson fondly described politics as a \u201ccontact sport.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been called everything,\u201d he said in 2003. \u201cWhat the hell. If you don\u2019t like the combat, get out.\u201d",
      "Simpson\u2019s candor made him popular with voters. He also was known as a well-read, hardworking and sometimes hard-nosed politician involved in immigration, veterans\u2019 affairs and environmental issues.",
      "He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.",
      "Simpson opposed sentences of life without parole for juveniles and said he supported review of criminal sentences after a period of time.",

      "\u201cPart of me said I could do this for another three or four years but not six,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThe old fire in the belly is out. The edge is off.\u201d",
      "Others of his family in politics and government included his older brother, Pete, a University of Wyoming historian who served in the Wyoming House and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor in 1986. Alan Simpson\u2019s son Colin was speaker of the Wyoming House, and his nephew Milward Simpson directed the state parks department.",
      "After leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he often urged college students to be politically involved.",
      "In 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",
      "Simpson is survived by his wife, Ann; his brother Pete Simpson; sons Colin Simpson and William Simpson; and daughter Susan Simpson Gallagher."

    "summary": "A federal judge is ordering the Trump administration to reinstate thousands of previously terminated probationary employees across 18 different agencies.",
    "story": [
      "The order covers every major department other than the Pentagon.",
      "A federal judge temporarily paused the Trump administration's \"illegal\" reductions in force and reinstated approximately 20,000 probationary government employees across 18 agencies who had been terminated.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Bredar -- an Obama appointee -- concluded that the Trump administration failed to provide the legally required advanced notice before it tried to conduct \"massive layoffs.\" The judge also prohibited the Trump administration from conducting future mass firings without giving notice.",
      "\"When the federal government terminates large numbers of its employees, including those still on probation because they were recently hired or promoted, it must follow certain rules,\" Bredar wrote.",
      "The ruling applies to 18 of the federal agencies named as defendants in the case except for the Defense Department, the National Archives and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The decision came in a case brought by 20 Democratic attorneys general who sued last week to block the firings and is separate from a California judge's decision also dealing with probationary employees that was issued earlier Thursday.",
      "Similar to the reasoning of the judge in the California case, Bredar wrote that he believes the government lied when it listed \"performance\" or other individualized reasons as justification for the layoffs.",
      "\u201cOn the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is simply not conceivable that the Government could have conducted individualized assessments of the relevant employees in the relevant timeframe.\u201d",
      "Bredar concluded that the states that sued are suffering irreparable harm by having to assist thousands of unemployed workers who were fired illegally.",
      "\u201cLacking the notice to which they were entitled, the States weren't ready for the impact of so many unemployed people,\" he wrote. \"They are still scrambling to catch up,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Bredar\u2019s order will remain in place for two weeks, and he scheduled a hearing for March 26 to consider issuing a preliminary injunction, which is a longer-term measure.",
      "Like the California case, Bredar did not rule that the Trump administration is not able to conduct mass firings; rather, the administration just needs to provide advanced notice when it conducts a reduction in force. While the order provides a reprieve for more than 20,000 government workers, the lifeline is temporary, even if the order is extended later this month.",
      "The judge's order came after a hearing Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "The Democratic attorneys general argued that the Trump administration violated federal law with the firings by failing to give a required 60-day notice for a reduction in force, opting to pursue the terminations \"suddenly and without any advance notice.\"",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice have argued that the states lack standing because they \"cannot interject themselves into the employment relationship between the United States and government workers,\" and that to grant the temporary restraining order would \"circumvent\" the administrative process for challenging the firings.",
      "In separate earlier lawsuits, two other federal judges had declined to immediately block firings of federal employees or to reinstate them to their positions.",

      "While defending policies like the government's mass layoffs or the Pentagon's transgender service member ban, a number of DOJ attorneys have found themselves at a loss for words when trying to answer the questions asked of them.",
      "\"So, people with gender dysphoria can't be honest, humble, or have integrity. You think that's demeaning to people with gender dysphoria?\" U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes asked a DOJ attorney on Wednesday during a hearing on the service member ban.",
      "\"I can't answer that question,\" he responded.",
      "Reyes later rebuked each of the DOJ lawyers after they admitted that none of them had read any of the scientific studies used to support the ban in sworn court filings.",
      "During a contentious hearing in Maryland on Wednesday about Trump's mass firings -- which eventually led the judge overseeing the case to order approximately 20,000 government employees be reinstated -- a DOJ lawyer couldn't answer when a judge pressed him to confirm how many employees had been terminated.",
      "\"More than 50 or less than 50? ... More than 100 or less than 100? ... Less than 1,000?\" Judge James Bredar asked, to which the attorney replied that he couldn't make an estimate at that time.",
      "\"You don't know? ... Does anyone in the government know?\" the judge continued to press, only for the government's attorney to again say he doesn't know.",
      "For a hearing on an emergency order to block an executive order against the law firm Perkins Coie, the Department of Justice opted to send Chad Mizelle, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, to argue on behalf of the government. Mizelle's full-throated defense of the policy -- which bans lawyers from the firm from entering any government building -- led Judge Beryl Howell to remark that the sweeping nature of some of his arguments sent \"chills down my spine.\"",
      "\"When you say that if the president, in his view, takes the position that an individual or an organization or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation's interests, he can issue an executive order like this and take steps to bar that individual, that entity, that company from doing any business with the government, terminate whatever contracts, they've got, bar them from federal buildings?\" Howell said.",
      "\"I mean, that's a pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise,\" the judge said.",
      "\"If he made a finding that there's a national security risk with a particular law firm, then yes,\" Mizelle replied.",
      "During Friday's address at the Justice Department, Trump alleged, without presenting evidence, that media organizations and the Democratic Party were colluding to challenge his administration -- and he urged the lawyers to fight back.",
      "\"They are horrible people. They are scum,\" Trump said of those who oppose him in court. \"We will have these cases where you cannot allow yourselves to be deflected. You just cannot let it happen. You have such a higher calling.\"",
      "Trump's visit to DOJ headquarters, during which he laid out his vision for the department and repeatedly suggested his appointees should jail his political enemies, was a departure from decades of post-Watergate norms where DOJ leadership has sought to maintain an appearance of independence from the White House on criminal matters.",

      "Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director who helped guide Ohio through the early days of the pandemic, is running for governor as a Democrat \u2014 methodically building financial support and a statewide campaign.

Brown recently offered a treatise of sorts in The New Republic magazine for restoring the national Democratic Party with a pro-worker message, prompting speculation he might even be aspiring to the presidency.",

      "The Senate is preparing to give final approval to a bill that could result in harsher prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate was preparing Friday to give final approval to a bill that could result in harsher prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers as both Republicans and Democrats seek to show they can act to rein in distribution of the deadly drug.",
      "The bill has already passed the House and has picked up Democratic support in the Senate, showing many in the party are eager to clamp down on fentanyl distribution following an election in which Republican Donald Trump harped on the problem. House Republicans passed a similar bill in 2023 with dozens of Democrats joining in support, but it languished in the Democratic-held Senate.",
      "Critics say the proposal repeats the mistakes of the so-called \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d which imprisoned millions of people addicted to drugs, particularly Black Americans.",
      "Now, with Republicans in control of the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune has prioritized the legislation, making it one of the early bills to send to Trump for his signature. The president has indicated he will sign it.",
      "Thune said this week the legislation \u201cgives law enforcement a critical tool to go after the criminals bringing this poison into our country and selling it on our streets.\u201d",
      "Called the HALT Fentanyl Act, the bill would permanently place all copycat versions of fentanyl \u2014 alterations of the drug that are often sold by traffickers \u2014 on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's list of most dangerous drugs, known as Schedule 1. The drugs had already been temporarily placed on the list since 2018, but that designation was set to expire at the end of the month. The move would mean an increase in criminal convictions for distributing fentanyl-related substances, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The legislation also seeks to make it easier to research the drugs.",
      "The bill passed the House last month with 98 Democrats and every Republican except Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky in support. In the Senate, a majority of Democrats have supported the push to bring it to final passage. Law enforcement groups have also supported the bill.",
      "\u201cThis is bipartisan because, frankly, fentanyl is a bipartisan problem,\" said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who has sponsored the bill.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have found agreement on trying to halt the flow of fentanyl into the United States, where it is blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year. Trump has said that halting the illicit flow of fentanyl is one of the top goals of his on-again-off-again tariff threats against Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "But some progressive Democrats said the bill was missing an opportunity to tackle root causes of addiction or to focus on stopping the drug from entering the U.S.",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a statement that support for the bill was \u201cenabling a political stunt at the expense of real solutions.\u201d",
      "The bill will \u201cdo little to actually solve the fentanyl crisis but will make it harder to research addiction and overdose reversal medication, disrupt communities and families by incarcerating rather than treating addiction, and divert resources from methods that work to disrupt the flow of fentanyl in the United States to strategies from the outdated War-on-Drugs solutions that do not work,\u201d Markey added.",
      "The average prison sentence for those convicted of trafficking fentanyl-related drugs was seven years and three months in 2023, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Almost 60% of those convicted were Black, 23% were Hispanic and 16% were white."

      "The General Services Administration, working with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, has notified landlords that federal agencies will be terminating hundreds of leases for offices and buildings in the coming months",
      "The General Services Administration, working with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, has notified landlords that federal agencies will be terminating hundreds of leases for offices and buildings in the coming months. A GSA planning document dated March 10 lists the dates when many of the cancellations are expected to go into effect. That does not mean all the locations will close by those dates, but agencies would have to either negotiate new leases or move elsewhere if they remain open. Agencies are still figuring out what to do.",

    "story": [
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has described humanitarian aid cuts by the United States and other countries as \u201ca crime\u201d",
      "COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh -- U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Friday that the humanitarian aid cuts by the United States and other countries in Europe \u201care a crime.\u201d",
      "He made the comment during a four-day visit to Bangladesh where he is assessing the plight of more than 1 million Rohingya refugees whose future remained uncertain over possible aid cuts soon.",
      "The U.N. would do everything possible to arrange adequate funding for the Rohingya refugees after recent announcement of dramatic aid cuts by the U.S. and other countries in Europe, Guterres said. As a result, the U.N.'s food agency recently said it would have no option but to cut food aid by half for the Rohingya from April if they fail to arrange adequate fund to feed them.",
      "In a meeting with Bangladesh\u2019s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus in the capital, Dhaka, Guterres expressed his concern over Western nations\u2019 decision to boost defense spending while humanitarian aid is squeezed across the world.",
      "\u201d(Aid) cuts are a crime,\u201d the U.N. chief was quoted as telling Yunus by the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha agency during Friday\u2019s meeting.",
      "Worries surfaced in recent weeks in dozens of camps for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh\u2019s southern coastal district of Cox\u2019s Bazar and elsewhere over fears of aid cuts following Washington\u2019s decision to close c operations. A large proportion of the millions of dollars needed for supporting Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh come from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Bangladesh had said that the halt of international aid money would stop other projects in the country but that funding for Rohingya refugees would continue to flow.",
      "A letter from the U.N.'s World Food Program earlier this month said cuts to food rations could take effect from next month at Cox\u2019s Bazar, home to dozens of camps housing Rohingya refugees. The WFP said the food rations could be reduced to $6, from the current $12.50 per month, unless adequate funding is secured.",
      "WFP spokesperson Kun Li said recently if the WFP is unable to secure sufficient funding \u2014 $81 million to sustain operations through the end of the year, including $15 million needed for April \u2014 it will have to reduce rations starting next month.",
      "Guterres arrived in Bangladesh on Thursday for his second visit to the country which is seen as crucial after the announcement of possible aid cuts by the WFP and others in the aftermath of the closure of the six-decade-old USAID.",
      "An interim government in Bangladesh hopes the visit will boost international efforts to mobilize aid for the Rohingya refugees and attract new global attention to their crisis.",
      "Yunus, who came to power in August after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted from office in a mass uprising, used his meeting with Guterres to seek U.N. support for the dignified return of the Rohingya to their homeland in the western Rakhine state in Myanmar. He also asked Guterres to mobilize adequate food and humanitarian assistance for the refugees.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to raise attention of the plight of the Rohingya people. The world should know how they are suffering. There is a feeling of frustration,\u201d Yunus was quoted as saying.",
      "Guterres and Yunus left Dhaka to visit camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar district where the leaders met the refugees and learned about their plights.",
      "In a media briefing later Friday, Guterres said that he would make his best effort to manage funds for the refugees to avoid any dire situation that could even cause deaths of the refugees. \u201cWe cannot accept that international community forgets about the Rohingya,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. has been the top donor to Bangladesh for Rohingya refugees, providing the U.N. with emergency food and nutrition assistance. The U.S. usually provides almost half of the aid money spent on the humanitarian response to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which provided about $300 million in 2024.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, including more than 700,000 who arrived in 2017, have lived in Bangladesh for decades. About 70,000 others crossed the border from Myanmar in 2024. During fighting with the military junta, opposition force known as the Arakan Army effectively took over the Rakhine state where Rohingya were displaced and took shelter in Bangladesh.",
      "Bangladesh says repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar is the ultimate solution. The Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been accused in an international court of genocide against Rohingya. Complexities over verification and other diplomatic and political issues have made the future of the refugees bleak.",
      "\u2014\u2014",

    "story": [
      "When the Episcopal Church announced cuts to its national staff last month, it was the latest in a long-running cycle among historic U.S. Protestant denominations \u2014 declines in members leading to declines in funding and thus in staff",
      "When the Episcopal Church recently announced cuts to its national staff, it was the latest in a long-running cycle among historic U.S. Protestant denominations \u2014 declines in members leading to declines in funding and thus in staff.",
      "And it wasn't alone.",
      "The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) also announced recent cuts to staff at its headquarters and in its global missions program. The United Methodist Church, after undergoing a major schism, has settled into a historically low budget, having cut its numbers of bishops and other positions.",
      "While the circumstances vary from one denomination to another, there are some common threads. Several Protestant denominations are losing members, particularly the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other historic mainline groups that have not only been aging and shrinking but have suffered schisms as they moved in more progressive directions.",
      "At the same time, the number of nondenominational churches has grown over the past decade, as have the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated.",
      "As a result, denominations have had to do less with less \u2014 not only cutting budgets to balance the bottom line, but making strategic changes and trying out new ideas.",
      "Despite their different structures, \u201cevery one of these national bodies really have to deal with changing social contexts and ethos,\u201d said Scott Thumma, co-director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the skepticism around national organizations and institutions.\u201d",
      "In their heyday, denominational offices oversaw mission organizations that sent large numbers of church workers to far corners of the world. They put out officially sanctioned hymnals, devotional guides, magazines and Sunday School materials. They organized big national conventions that set \u2014 and fiercely debated \u2014 policy and doctrine. They set standards for how ministers were trained, credentialed and disciplined. They ran historical societies and pension funds for ministers.",
      "The Southern Baptist Convention 's Cooperative Program, marking its 100th anniversary this year, is a testament to the traditional idea that it's more efficient to pool everyone's money and trust leaders to allocate it wisely. The convention still runs a large missions program. But its churches aren't sending as much as they used to. The SBC has also declined in membership. and it faces unique challenges such as litigation following a report on sexual misconduct. Its Executive Committee, which trimmed its staff in 2023, is putting its Nashville office up for sale.",
      "Nowadays, not only has trust in centralized leadership faded, but there often are fewer church members to support programs and activities. Many denominational churches are acting more like nondenominational ones \u2014 downloading music or Sunday School lessons from independent rather than official sources.",
      "Last month, the Episcopal Church announced the layoff of 14 workers, with another 16 retiring this year under an incentive program. Another 13 vacant positions are being eliminated. Other staffers are being trained to take on new roles, and the denomination projects it will have a net total of about 110 full-time workers by next year.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to meet the emerging financial reality but also to determine how we can continue to serve the church as it\u2019s becoming something different than it was,\u201d Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe said in an interview.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s creating networks on the ground,\" he said. \"It\u2019s paying attention to what is new and working, and lifting that up.\u201d",
      "Some of the shift in strategy will involve looking at ways to support local dioceses and parishes, which are \u201cbetter equipped to know what their needs are,\" Rowe said.",
      "The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) cut 12 positions from its central offices late last year. It also enacted a major change in its approach to global missions earlier this year, eliminating the position of mission co-worker, or those who worked directly in other countries in schools, churches or other ministries. The church will retain workers who will maintain regular contacts with Presbyterian and other churches overseas, as well as interfaith contacts, while also working with diaspora communities in the United States. The world mission staff reduced from 79 to 44, according to a church announcement last month.",
      "The changes are difficult, acknowledged the Rev. Jihyun Oh, executive director of the PC (U.S.A.)'s Interim Unified Agency, a recently consolidated office overseeing a range of denominational work.",
      "The denomination is roughly a third of its size when it took its current form in the 1980s, following a reunification of northern and southern branches. And while many members had increased their giving to missions over the past two decades, the net effect of fewer members was a decline in funds. It was important, Oh said, to reorganize now, before a financial crisis required a more drastic cut. Meanwhile, some of the countries where mission workers once were assigned now have well-established Presbyterian churches, she said.",
      "\u201cThe church\u2019s witness and ministry is not coming to an end,\u201d she said. \u201cThere can be resurrection and renewal in a different sort of way.\" That renewal might be measured not so much by numbers but \"in terms of impact, in terms of partnerships, in terms of other ways that we will actually be called to live out faith in this time.\u201d",
      "She hopes church members understand that \u201cGod\u2019s not done with us.\"",
      "In the United Methodist Church, giving to denomination-wide ministries fell by about 13% to $91 million in 2024, according to its General Council on Finance and Administration. That didn't cause an immediate shock because the denomination has been preparing for such declines in recent years.",
      "It underwent a years-long schism in which a quarter of its churches left by the end of 2023. Many joined a more conservative denomination before the UMC's General Convention in 2024 removed its longstanding bans on ordaining and marrying LGBTQ people, while continuing to allow church conferences in other countries to set their own rules.",
      "United Methodist denominational agencies currently have 503 full-time employees, down 36% since 2016, according to the council.",
      "Thumma said that even though \u201corganized religion\u201d gets a bad name these days, that's not the full story.",
      "\u201cYou have people who are still interested in spirituality, some sort of gathering around something higher than themselves, but not in these particular forms,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of religious and denominational leaders who realize that, but the question is what forms or structures are going to resonate with those folks.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is listing all the federal real estate leases it is ending, but new records obtained by The Associated Press show when those cancellations are expected to take effect",
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk\u2019s budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "Musk's Department of Government Efficiency maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation \u2014 which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West \u2014 to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations do not mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\u201cSome agencies are saying: \u2018I\u2019m not leaving. We can\u2019t leave,\u2019\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE\u2019s savings estimates \u2014 a fraction of Musk\u2019s $1 trillion cost-cutting goal \u2014 have not been verified and do not take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group has released no information about what they will mean for agencies.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\u201d said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\u201d",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \u201ccause a lot of anxiety\u201d and delay refunds.",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes are not yet reflected on DOGE\u2019s list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it did not have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he\u2019d convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE\u2019s list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government\u2019s real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who had been expecting government agencies to remain tenants, for several more years in some cases under their existing leases, were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what\u2019s known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS did not respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \u201csmall remote hearing sites,\u201d did not serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity \u2014 saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\u201d",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \u201clong overdue,\u201d saying agencies have for too long held on to unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \u201cgenerate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\u201d",
      "That process had already started before Musk\u2019s team arrived, with the federal government\u2019s real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Trump took office was to deliver \u201ceffective and efficient\u201d services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that did not meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\u201dThere is a logical and orderly way to do this,\u201d Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week\u2019s hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different, and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\u201cIt really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\u201d said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s like a blitzkrieg.\u201d",

      "College students, rocket scientists and math enthusiasts around the world are celebrating Pi Day",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Math enthusiasts around the world, from college students to rocket scientists, celebrate Pi Day, which is March 14 or 3/14 \u2014 the first three digits of an infinite number with many practical uses.",
      "Many people will mark the day with a slice of pie \u2014 sweet, savory or even pizza.",
      "Simply put, pi is a mathematical constant that expresses the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter. It figures into numerous formulas used in physics, astronomy, engineering and other fields, dating back thousands of years to ancient Egypt, Babylon and China.",
      "Pi Day itself dates to 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw began celebrations at the Exploratorium science museum in San Francisco. The holiday didn\u2019t really gain national recognition until two decades later. In 2009, Congress designated every March 14 to be the big day \u2014 in the hopes of spurring more interest in math and science. Fittingly enough, the day is also Albert Einstein\u2019s birthday.",
      "Here\u2019s a little more about the holiday\u2019s origin and how it\u2019s celebrated today.",
      "Pi can calculate the circumference of a circle by measuring the diameter \u2014 the distance straight across the circle\u2019s middle \u2014 and multiplying that by the 3.14-plus number.",
      "It is considered a constant number and it is also infinite, meaning it is mathematically irrational. Long before computers, historic scientists such as Isaac Newton spent many hours calculating decimal places by hand. Today, using sophisticated computers, researchers have come up with trillions of digits for pi, but there is no end.",
      "It wasn\u2019t given its name until 1706, when Welsh mathematician William Jones began using the Greek symbol for the number.",
      "Why that letter? It\u2019s the first Greek letter in the words \u201cperiphery\u201d and \u201cperimeter,\u201d and pi is the ratio of a circle\u2019s periphery \u2014 or circumference \u2014 to its diameter.",
      "The number is key to accurately pointing an antenna toward a satellite. It helps figure out everything from the size of a massive cylinder needed in refinery equipment to the size of paper rolls used in printers.",
      "Pi is also useful in determining the necessary scale of a tank that serves heating and air conditioning systems in buildings of various sizes.",
      "NASA uses pi on a daily basis. It\u2019s key to calculating orbits, the positions of planets and other celestial bodies, elements of rocket propulsion, spacecraft communication and even the correct deployment of parachutes when a vehicle splashes down on Earth or lands on Mars.",
      "Using just nine digits of pi, scientists can calculate the Earth\u2019s circumference so accurately it errs by only about a quarter of an inch (0.6 centimeters) for every 25,000 miles (about 40,000 kilometers).",
      "Every year the San Francisco museum that coined the holiday organizes events, including a parade around a circular plaque, called the Pi Shrine, 3.14 times \u2014 and then, of course, festivities with lots of pie.",
      "Across the country, many events now take place on college campuses. At Florida Atlantic University in Jupiter, Florida, students in the Jupiter Mathematics Club are hosting a Pi Day Extravaganza with a raffle to hit math professors with a pie, along with a contest for who can memorize the most digits of pi.",
      "Restaurants across the country, including some pizza chains, also offer $3.14 specials on Pi Day.",
      "NASA holds its annual Pi Day Challenge online, offering plenty of games and puzzles, some directly from the space agency\u2019s own playbook, such as calculating the orbit of an asteroid or the distance a moon rover would need to travel each day to survey a certain lunar area.",
      "Possibly the world\u2019s best-known scientist, Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Germany. The infinite number of pi was used in many of his breakthrough theories and now Pi Day gives the world another reason to celebrate his achievements.",
      "In a bit of math symmetry, famed physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. Still, pi is not a perfect number. He once had this to say:",
      "\u201cOne of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn\u2019t exist. Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.\u201d",

      "Immigrants who are cooperating with officials while they apply to stay in the U.S. are now fearful of detention during routine appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement",
      "When a couple from Colombia who was planning their wedding showed up for a check-in with U.S. immigration authorities, one was given his next appointment date. The other was detained and deported.",
      "Jhojan doesn\u2019t know why Felipe was detained at the Feb. 5 appointment with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. But Jhojan was so worried after Felipe's deportation that he didn\u2019t show up for his next check-in a month later. Jhojan insisted The Associated Press withhold the couple\u2019s last names, fearing retribution.",
      "He is among many people who now fear that once-routine immigration check-ins will be used as an opportunity to detain them. The appointments have become a source of anxiety as President Donald Trump presses ahead with a campaign of mass deportations and the number of people in ICE custody has reached its highest level since November 2019.",
      "The check-ins are how ICE keeps track of some people who are released by the government to pursue asylum or other immigration cases as they make their way through a backlogged court system. The government has not said how many people ICE has detained at such appointments or whether that\u2019s now standard practice, but immigration advocates and attorneys are concerned people might stop showing up, putting themselves further at risk of deportation.",
      "\u201cIf you show up, they\u2019ll deport you. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll deport you, too,\u201d Jhojan, 23, told the AP this week.",
      "ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not respond to repeated requests for comment about immigrants being detained at check-ins.",
      "With the federal government releasing little information, it\u2019s hard to sort out facts from rumors as fears run rampant in many immigrant communities. However, Trump has made it a priority to deport anyone who is in the U.S. illegally, a sharp shift from his predecessor, Joe Biden, who focused only on immigrants who were deemed public safety or national security threats and people stopped at the border.",
      "ICE has arrested 32,809 people since Trump took office, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said Wednesday during a call with reporters. About 47,600 people are in ICE detention, according to the ICE official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with guidance set by the administration.",
      "It\u2019s the first time in four years that ICE has arrested more people than Customs and Border Protection, indicating that more immigrants are being detained inside the U.S. than along its borders.",
      "ICE calls people in for appointments for several reasons, including issuing a court date. If an immigrant breaks the law during that time or a judge declines their appeal to stay in the U.S., ICE can detain and deport them.",
      "In Louisiana, ICE detained an immigrant last month who was asked to show up under the guise of being eligible for another program with less supervision, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which declined to offer further details.",
      "ICE also has locked up some people it just recently deemed as likely to qualify for asylum and unlikely to flee authorities.",
      "John Torres, a former ICE acting director, said it\u2019s hard to comment in detail without more information about each case. But, he added, \u201cthe major reason those things take place is because something has changed in their status or something\u2019s been discovered about their background.\u201d",
      "An immigrant from Ecuador who is in his 20s is among the asylum-seekers who have been detained, according to attorney Rosa Barreca.",
      "It happened at the man's first check-in, on Feb. 3. The man had turned himself in to border agents after entering the U.S. illegally three weeks earlier. ICE officials at that time interviewed him and released him from custody, concluding he had a reasonable fear of persecution if he returned to his home country, according to Barreca.",
      "Releasing him suggested that ICE wasn\u2019t concerned he would flee. The fact that he didn't made it easier for ICE to jail him.",
      "\u201cThe family called me surprised and in a panic,\u201d said Barreca, who runs a private practice in Philadelphia, where the man's family lives. \u201cWhen I asked the reason, he just said it is based on the executive orders and didn\u2019t specify anything further.\u201d",
      "He had no criminal convictions and no contact with police during his few weeks in the U.S., Barreca said, ruling out every red flag she can imagine.",
      "Lawyers cannot advise clients to simply skip the meetings, which would lead to deportation orders. Instead, advocates and lawyers urge immigrants to prepare for appointments and the possibility of detention. They\u2019re cautioning immigrants to note sudden changes in how their check-ins are conducted \u2014 such as appointments that were always virtual instead being done in person.",
      "They are also encouraging immigrants to make emergency child care arrangements and to provide details of their cases with friends and family. That includes sharing a unique identification number that ICE uses to track people.",
      "Immigrant rights groups say people should bring someone, preferably an attorney, to ICE appointments.",
      "Advocates are also returning to a tactic from the first Trump administration by telling people to have a group of supporters walk them to their check-ins and wait outside.",
      "\u201cWhen people feel unsafe going to report, it\u2019s setting everything up for failure,\u201d said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cIt undermines the trust that people need to have.\u201d",

      "The National Weather Service predicted extreme weather across a vast swath of the U.S. with a population exceeding 100 million people. Powerful winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were forecast from the Canadian line to the Rio Grande border with Mexico.",
      "Forecasters say the severe storm threat will continue into the weekend, with a moderate chance of tornadoes and damaging winds pushing farther south Saturday to areas including New Orleans and Birmingham, Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the East Coast on Sunday.",
      "Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March, when emerging spring warmth and lingering winter cold create big temperature differences for storms to thrive.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s a time of the year where a storm like this can deliver these coast-to-coast impacts, we are in it,\u201d said Benjamin Reppert, a meteorologist at Penn State University.",

      "Forecasters said tornadoes, damaging winds and hail up to baseball-size were likely, with the greatest risk in eastern Missouri, much of Illinois and portions of Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas. The weather service's Storm Prediction Center said 17 million people faced an enhanced to moderate severe storm threat from Des Moines, Iowa, to Jackson, Mississippi.",
      "The tornado threat pushes farther south on Saturday into the Gulf Coast states, including New Orleans and other parts of eastern Louisiana and much of Mississippi and Alabama.",
      "Forecasters warned that heavy snow whipped by powerful winds are likely to make travel treacherous in parts of the Rockies and Northern Plains. Blizzard conditions were possible in the Dakotas and Minnesota.",
      "Winter storm warnings issued Thursday lingered into Friday morning in mountainous regions of Arizona and Utah, where more than a foot (30 centimeters) of snowfall was possible. Forecasters warned of poor visibility and icy road conditions, urging motorists to travel with extra food and water in case they became stranded.",
      "The winter blast continued after snowfall of up to 3 feet (90 centimeters) blanketed the Sierra Nevada earlier in the week.",
      "Warm, dry weather and sustained winds of up to 45 mph (72 kph) brought what the weather service called \u201cnear historic\u201d conditions for sparking wildfires Friday to the Southern Plains and parts of the Southwest. Wind gusts exceeding 80 mph (128 kph) were possible.",
      "Forecasters shared a bit of advice during a special briefing: For those stuck on the roads, keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and watch for fallen trees, power lines and other debris. They said the strong winds would be kicking up plenty of dust and that brownout conditions were possible.",
      "\u201cThis is likely to be the worst dust storm so far this year,\u201d said Randall Hergert, a lead forecaster with the weather service in Albuquerque.",
      "Forecasters also warned about an extreme risk of fires in parts of northern Texas, much of Oklahoma and southeast Kansas. A broader area where the fire threat was designated as critical stretched from eastern New Mexico into Texas and north to a portion of southern Iowa.",
      "The weather service said a potential for dry thunderstorms in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas carry the added risk of fires being started by lightning with minimal rainfall to stop them from spreading."

      "A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday that it had measured during recent overflights \u201csignificantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\u201d and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\u201d the observatory said in a statement. \u201cSuch stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\u201d",
      "It is an 11,070-foot (3,374-meter) tall, ice- and snow-covered volcano roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents.",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "However, \u201cIt is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\u201d John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world\u2019s busiest cargo hubs.",

      "High-security prisons across California have tightly restricted movement, calls and visits while officials probe a surge in violence this year.",
      "The restrictions started Saturday and affect the top-security sections of nearly a dozen lockups including the California Correctional Institution, California State Prison-Los Angeles County and California State Prison-Sacramento.",
      "Under the protocols, meals must be delivered directly to housing units and showers and any other movements must be done in a \u201ccontrolled manner,\u201d the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement.",
      "Calls by telephone and ViaPath tablet are also restricted, as are visitations.",
      "Prisoners still have access to medical care, legal proceedings and other \u201ccritical appointments,\u201d corrections officials said.",
      "\u201cIt is important to note this modified program is distinct from a lockdown and applies exclusively to Level IV housing units,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Asked for more information about the restrictions, CDCR spokesperson Terri Hardy said only that officials are conducting a \u201ccomprehensive investigation into underlying causes of violent incidents at Level IV facilities throughout the state. The investigation continues.\u201d",
      "Corrections officials are investigating seven deaths since the beginning of the year as homicides. Three of those happened the day before the restrictions were announced by the Corrections department.",
      "Joshua L. Peppers, 39, was attacked by another prisoner at the Los Angeles County institution March 7 and died at a medical facility, corrections officials said in a statement. He was serving a sentence for second-degree robbery.",
      "That same morning Jake T. Kennedy, 32, was found stabbed multiple times in his cell at the Sacramento prison, according to corrections officials. He died at a triage and treatment area, and an improvised weapon was found. He was serving time for carrying a concealed bladed weapon and for a subsequent prison assault.",
      "And hours later German M. Merino, 37, died after he was attacked by two inmates in Kern Valley State Prison, authorities said. He was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.",
      "Prison violence is a longstanding problem as people serving life sentences have little to lose.",
      "In January, for example, Mario Campbell, 36, was attacked on the main exercise yard at the Sacramento prison by two inmates serving live with the possibility of parole, according to corrections officials. He died at a medical facility about an hour and a half later, and officers found three improvised weapons.",
      "The restrictions will stay in place until the investigation is completed. It\u2019s unclear how long that could take.",
      "Last year there were 32 homicides in state lockups, according to the California Correctional Health Care Services."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Egg prices again reached a record high in February, as the bird flu continues to run rampant and Easter and Passover approach.",
      "The latest monthly Consumer Price Index showed a dozen Grade A eggs cost an average of $5.90 in U.S. cities in February, up 10.4% from a year ago. That eclipsed January's record-high price of $4.95.",
      "Avian flu has forced farmers to slaughter more than 166 million birds, mostly were egg-laying chickens. Just since the start of the year, more than 30 million egg layers have been killed.",
      "If prices remain high, it will be third year in a row consumers have faced sticker shock ahead of Easter on April 20 and Passover, which starts on the evening of April 12, both occasions in which eggs play prominent roles.",
      "The price had consistently been below $2 a dozen for decades before the disease struck. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year\u2019s average of $3.17 per dozen.",
      "But there may be light at the end of the tunnel. The USDA reported last week that egg shortages are easing and wholesale prices are dropping, which might provide relief on the retail side before this year\u2019s late Easter, which is three weeks later than last year. It said there had been no major bird flu outbreak for two weeks.",
      "\u201cShoppers have begun to see shell egg offerings in the dairycase becoming more reliable although retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,\u201d the USDA wrote in the March 7 report.",
      "David Anderson, a professor and extension economist for livestock and food marketing at Texas A&M University, said wholesale figures dropping is a good sign that prices could go down as shoppers react to the high prices by buying fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cWhat that should tell us is things are easing a little bit in terms of prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo going forward, the next CPI report may very well indicate falling egg prices.\u201d",
      "However, he doesn't expect lasting changes until bird stock can be replenished and production can be replaced.",
      "\u201cRecord high prices is a market signal to producers to produce more, but it takes time to be able to produce more, and we just haven\u2019t had enough time for that to happen yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s going to take some more months to get there.\u201d",
      "Advocacy groups and others have also called for a probe into whether egg producers have used the avian flu to price gouge. But egg producers say the avian flu is solely behind the elevated prices.",
      "Meanwhile, restaurants have added surcharges and made other changes to offset the cost of eggs.",
      "The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to combat bird flu, $500 million investment to help farmers bolster biosecurity measures, $400 million in additional aid for farmers whose flocks have been impacted by avian flu, $100 million to research and potentially develop vaccines and therapeutics for U.S. chicken flocks. But it will likely take a while for that plan to make an impact."

      "\u201cWe are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America\u2019s Golden Age,'' EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in an essay in the Wall Street Journal.",
      "His actions will eliminate trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and \u201chidden taxes,\u201d Zeldin said, lowering the cost of living for American families and reducing prices for such essentials such as buying a car, heating your home and operating a business.",
      "\u201cOur actions will also reignite American manufacturing, spreading economic benefits to communities,\" Zeldin wrote.",
      "In all, Zeldin said he is rolling back 31 environmental rules, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change.",
      "Zeldin said he and President Donald Trump support rewriting the agency\u2019s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The Obama-era determination under the Clean Air Act is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.",
      "Environmentalists and climate scientists call the endangerment finding a bedrock of U.S. law and say any attempt to undo it will have little chance of success.",
      "\u201cIn the face of overwhelming science, it\u2019s impossible to think that the EPA could develop a contradictory finding that would stand up in court,\" said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.",
      "In a related action, Zeldin said EPA will rewrite a rule restricting air pollution from fossil-fueled fired power plants and a separate measure restricting emissions from cars and trucks. Zeldin and Trump incorrectly label the car rule as an electric vehicle \"mandate.''",
      "The Biden administration had said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting the reliable, long-term supply of electricity that America needs."

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-born disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000 people, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "The release follows a recent visit to the region by Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's top hostage envoy, and comes amid a continued U.S. government push to bring home American citizens jailed in foreign countries.",
      "Six of the newly freed prisoners were accompanied on a flight from Kuwait to New York by Jonathan Franks, a private consultant who works on cases involving American hostages and detainees and who had been in the country to help secure their release.",
      "\u201cMy clients and their families are grateful to the Kuwaiti government for this kind humanitarian gesture,\u201d Franks said in a statement.",
      "He said that his clients maintain their innocence and that additional Americans he represents also are expected to be released by Kuwait later.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The names of the released prisoners were not immediately made public.",
      "Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation that borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is near Iran, is considered a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid tribute to that relationship as recently as last month, when he said the U.S. \u201cremains steadfast in its support for Kuwait\u2019s sovereignty and the well-being of its people.\u201d",

      "The Americans released Wednesday had not been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained. The status is applied to a subsection of Americans jailed abroad and historically ensures the case is handled by the administration's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs \u2014 the office that handles negotiations for a release.",
      "But advocates of those held in foreign countries are hopeful the Trump administration takes a more flexible approach and secures the release of those not deemed wrongfully detained.",
      "\u201cThe sad reality is that these Americans were left in prison for years due to a misguided policy that had, before President Trump took office, effectively abandoned Americans abroad who hadn't been designated wrongfully detained,\u201d Franks said in a statement.",

      "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has pledged to start paying out tens of billions in aid to victims of Hurricane Helene later this month",
      "ATLANTA -- Tens of billions in aid for victims of Hurricane Helene should start flowing later this month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pledged Wednesday, but delays are already making it hard this year for some farmers to plant crops.",
      "Congress set a deadline of March 21 to hand out the money when it passed a $100 billion disaster relief package on Dec. 21. The late September storm cut a swath from Florida's Big Bend across eastern Georgia and upstate South Carolina before causing historic flooding in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.",
      "The National Centers for Environmental Information says Helene is the seventh-most expensive disaster in the United States since 1980, causing an estimated $78 billion in damage and 219 deaths.",
      "At a news conference in Atlanta on Wednesday, Rollins pledged the aid would begin to be disbursed before the deadline.",
      "\u201cThat money will begin to move in the next few weeks,\" she said.",
      "That's not a moment too soon for Chris Hopkins, who farms near Lyons in south Georgia. Helene wiped out half the cotton Hopkins was growing on 1,400 acres (560 hectares). He said Tuesday that he began planting 300 acres (121 hectares) of corn this month, and plans to start planting cotton in late April.",
      "Hopkins said the big losses forced him to dip into emergency reserve funds to pay off $200,000 in 2024 loans for seed, fertilizer and other materials. Some neighboring farmers hit hard by the storm still have unpaid debts from last year, he said, leaving them unable to borrow more to start planting 2025 crops.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s desperately needed,\u201d Hopkins said of federal aid. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that producers are almost in a holding or pause pattern because they can\u2019t afford to pay their rent or their loans.\u201d",
      "Hopkins said farmers had hoped the money would come sooner, in January or February, so they could pay off creditors before planting season. He said some have sold equipment or even land to generate enough cash to get new crops started.",
      "\u201cThe general consensus in the farming and ag community is that it would have been much better earlier,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cAg producers are thankful for it by all means. But taking the full 90 days to get it is tough.\u201d",
      "In South Carolina, Republican legislative leaders decided to wait to approve Helene damage relief money in the state\u2019s regular budget instead of an emergency bill in part because they expected federal officials to get relief money out quickly.",
      "Most but not all of the disaster relief bill is earmarked for Helene. It includes $21 billion to help farmers, $8 billion to rebuild damaged roads and highways, $12 billion in grants to help communities and individuals recover and $2.2 billion in low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners.",
      "Officials have estimated that Helene caused property and economic damage to the agriculture sector totaling $5.5 billion in Georgia and $4.9 billion in North Carolina.",
      "Beyond the cotton crop, the storm toppled pecan trees and flattened chicken houses in Georgia. Farming in western North Carolina is dominated by specialty crops including Christmas trees and nursery plants, with fewer growers covered by crop insurance.",
      "South Carolina officials estimated $620 million in agriculture damage in 2024, not just from Helene, but also from other weather disasters.",
      "State governments have been moving to expand their aid packages. Georgia has earmarked $285 million for low-interest loans for farmers and removing downed timber from private land in an amended budget that Gov. Brian Kemp signed last week, part of $862 million in Helene-related spending.",
      "North Carolina lawmakers are negotiating the details of a supplemental Helene relief bill that may total more than $500 million, in part to provide more funds for crop losses. It would be North Carolina\u2019s fourth Helene aid package to be enacted. The state has requested close to $1.9 billion from the disaster relief law approved by Congress in December. Most of that money would go to address crop and timber losses, debris removal, stream restoration and erosion.",
      "The South Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a budget that includes $220 million in Helene relief for farmers and others as a match to money from the federal government. They also set aside $50 million to give to the state Department of Transportation to pay back what they spent repairing roads and clearing trees.",

      "The Associated Press has obtained a document showing that the Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing",
      "The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The action is part of a slew of cuts and funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely at the direction of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, that have rattled the affordable-housing industry.",
      "Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it's a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation's housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans.",
      "The program has already awarded the money to projects that would upgrade at least 25,000 affordable units across the country, and details of how it will be wound down remain unclear.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But an internal document reviewed by the AP said that the program is being \u201cterminated\u201d at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD workers, who have knowledge of the program and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, confirmed the directive to shutter it.",
      "On it's face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing.",
      "But the money plays a much larger role in preserving affordable units.",
      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",

      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between living and not being able to live,\" he said.",
      "HUD's lack of communication about the program's future sent organizations in search of contingency plans, though roughly two dozen projects will still get funding, one HUD employee told the AP. The rest are in limbo.",
      "\u201cIf these funds aren\u2019t reinstated, we will certainly seek other funding to fill that gap. The reality is that will take time and will inevitably make the project more expensive,\u201d Travis Phillips of the Housing Development Center said of funding for Smith Tower.",
      "It's the position several hundred other affordable-housing projects now find themselves in across 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.",

      "A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded guilty to in 2022, before he tried unsuccessfully to take back his plea.",
      "Former Sen. Brian Kelsey announced that he received a \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d in a social media post Tuesday evening. He had been ordered to report to FCI Ashland's minimum security satellite camp in Kentucky on Feb. 24. A federal database said Kelsey was no longer in Bureau of Prisons custody as of Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMay God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\u201d Kelsey said in the post.",
      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \u201cGod used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\u201d referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \u201cunsure heart and a confused mind.\u201d He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn\u2019t understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey\u2019s challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \u201cunconditional admission of guilt\u201d under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he announced the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \u201ccooperate fully and truthfully.\u201d He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey\u2019s state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey\u2019s 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey\u2019s campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn\u2019t seek reelection in 2022.",
      "Kelsey served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees changes to civil and criminal laws, judicial proceedings and more. His law license was suspended in 2022 after his guilty plea.",

      "President Donald Trump campaigned as a champion of free speech, but First Amendment advocates say they\u2019ve never seen freedom of speech under attack the way it has been in his second term",
      "DENVER -- When President Donald Trump gave his joint address to Congress last week, he boasted that in his first few weeks back in the White House he had \u201cbrought free speech back to America.\u201d",
      "But First Amendment advocates say they've never seen freedom of speech under attack the way it has been in Trump's second term.",
      "Trump's Republican administration has threatened Democratic members of Congress with investigation for criticizing conservatives, pulled federal grants that include language it opposes, sanctioned law firms that represent Trump's political opponents and arrested the organizer of student protests that Trump criticized as \u201canti-Semitic, anti-American.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour right to say something depends on what the administration thinks of it, which is no free speech at all,\u201d said Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group.",
      "Trump on Monday took credit for the arrest by immigration agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests there. Khalil's lawyers say the government is targeting him for his activism and to \u201cdiscriminate against particular viewpoints.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration will revoke the visas or green cards of supporters of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization, \"so they can be deported.\u201d The government has not yet filed documents specifying why Khalil was detained, and a federal judge earlier this week ordered immigration officials not to remove Khalil from the country while his case is sorted out.",
      "Trump supporters, including members of Congress, have argued that because Khalil is not a U.S. citizen, the government can target him for his speech, which they contend amounts to sympathy for terrorism.",
      "\u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Even some Trump allies were uncomfortable with that approach: \u201cThere's almost no one I don't want to deport,\u201d wrote conservative commentator Ann Coulter on X, \u201cbut, unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the first amendment?\u201d",
      "On the other end of the political spectrum, activists who organized to protest the war in Gaza were aghast at the administration's move.",
      "\u201cWe learn about our First Amendment rights since we\u2019re children,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of Stanford University's Students for Justice in Palestine. \u201cBut that is very much a myth. It\u2019s not the reality we live in right now. And it\u2019s scary.\u201d",
      "Prior to the arrest of Khalil over the weekend, the administration pressured Columbia University to crack down on anti-Israel activism among students and faculty, and Trump has threatened to go after any college that supports protests he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "He also issued an order forbidding federal funding of what his administration labels diversity, equity and inclusion, which led to a freeze on federal grants as the administration reviews them for forbidden words such as \u201cgender.\u201d",
      "Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, which sued the Trump administration over its DEI ban and won an injunction against it from a federal judge, said the administration is pulling funding from projects that have prohibited words, yanking grants from research into such areas as crop diversity or differences in infant mortality in urban and rural areas.",
      "\u201cNobody really wants Big Brother telling you what you can research,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cThese are questions our country needs to know the answers to.\u201d",
      "Republicans for several years have been the party complaining about infringements on the First Amendment, from complaints about \u201cwoke\u201d colleges canceling conservative speakers to bashing social media companies they accuse of censoring conservative viewpoints, including cutting Trump off after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol. GOP-controlled Florida and Texas even drew up laws to limit how social media firms regulate content, though the U.S. Supreme Court kept them on hold last year because of possible First Amendment violations.",
      "Last year, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the First Amendment during his campaign, and he signed an executive order just hours after being sworn into office prohibiting anyone in the federal government from interfering with Americans' free speech rights. But he also made pledges that signaled he might oppose some of the First Amendment's fundamental protections, such as deporting foreign students who protested Israel or outlawing flag-burning, which the Supreme Court has ruled is protected free speech.",
      "Creeley, of the individual rights foundation, said he tried to be optimistic before Trump took office that the new president would fix some First Amendment issues. Instead, he said, it's gotten worse.",
      "\u201cI cannot recall anything like this,\" Creeley said. \"I've been defending First Amendment rights since 2006, and this is the most serious of threats I can recall.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also has gone after the news media.",
      "The president has sued several outlets for coverage he dislikes, and his appointees at the Federal Communications Commission have helped pressure those media companies. Meanwhile, Trump's FCC is opening investigations of other media companies with which Trump has feuded, and the administration has barred The Associated Press from the White House press pool because it won't use Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. The AP is suing to restore its access on First Amendment grounds.",
      "The administration also has targeted law firms for their affiliations with Democrats or the previous administration. It stripped security clearances for lawyers at a firm that helped special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump during President Joe Biden's administration and Perkins Coie, a longtime Democratic firm that Trump blames for the investigation into his campaign's relationship with Russia during his first term. On Tuesday, Perkins Coie sued the administration to reverse the action, saying it violated the First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees.",
      "Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, said the attacks on the law firms have scared some high-profile attorneys out of taking cases that challenge the administration, which, he contended, is the point.",
      "\u201cThere's a long tradition of lawyers taking on controversial clients, sometimes against our government,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cThe Trump administration has made it clear it will retaliate against lawyers.\u201d",
      "Jaffer said attacks on free speech and association are intended to chill dissent by convincing people in the opposition that they could become targets.",
      "\u201cAll of us are able to participate in government by engaging in protest,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cWhen the government shuts down that kind of speech, it's shutting down democracy.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has even targeted members of Congress.",
      "Trump appointed Ed Martin, a defense attorney who represented some of those charged in the Jan. 6 attack, as acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia. Martin wrote to Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and one of the nation's top Democrats, telling him that a comment he made in 2020 warning conservative Supreme Court judges they would \u201cpay the price\u201d for overturning the right to abortion could be seen as a threat. Schumer has since apologized for the statement.",
      "Martin also wrote to Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, warning him that comments he made about Trump adviser Elon Musk could be seen as a threat. Garcia had said Democrats should \u201cbring actual weapons to this bar fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cMembers of Congress must have the right to forcefully oppose the Trump Administration,\" Garcia replied on Musk\u2019s X platform. \"I will not be silenced.\u201d",

      "It was Trump's first Oval Office meeting with a foreign leader since his recent sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which morphed into a shouting match as they jousted over ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

      "Martin, who offered only gentle pushback to some of Trump's comments, is set to return to the White House in the evening to present Trump with a bowl of shamrocks at an early St. Patrick's Day celebration. The duo also attended an annual luncheon at the Capitol.",

I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn\u2019t have let it happen.\u201d He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country's tax policies.",
      "\u201cWe had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn\u2019t have a clue or let\u2019s say they weren\u2019t businesspeople, but they didn\u2019t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,\" Trump said.",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- A 37-year-old man died after falling from a chairlift that was having a mechanical problem at a Montana ski area, according to local authorities and a spokesperson for Red Lodge Mountain.",
      "The man was riding alone in a three-person chair that carries skiers up the mountain when he fell from an unspecified height, according to Red Lodge Mountain spokesperson Troy Hawks. The accident happened Monday just before noon at the ski area southeast of Billings in the Beartooth Mountains.",
      "Jeffrey Zinne of Billings was taken to a Billings hospital where he was pronounced dead early Wednesday from injuries suffered in the fall, according to Carbon County Sheriff Josh McQuillan and Rich Hoffman with the Yellowstone County Coroner's Office.",
      "The lift, known as the Triple Chair, was stopped after the accident. More than 100 people who were on it at the time were evacuated by ski patrollers who used ropes to lower them to the ground.",
      "Hawks said the lift had a mechanical problem at the time Zinne fell, but declined to comment further and said the circumstances were being investigated. Weather conditions and the victim's actions also were being looked at, he said.",
      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 mph (80.4 kph) were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, he said.",
      "Staff at the ski area inspect its chairlifts daily, Hawks said. A professional inspection is conducted annually as required by Red Lodge Mountain's insurance carrier and the U.S. Forest Service, which leases land to the ski area, he said.",
      "Zinne, who had been snowboarding on Monday prior to his accident, was married with a 2-year-old son and owned the Montana Air Cartage freight hauling company, according to a post on a GoFundMe fundraising site set up on his family\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cHe was more than just a boss for many people here. He was a friend, a mentor,\u201d said Jessice Sande, a manager at Montana Air Cartage who recalled Zinne's infectious laugh.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at Colorado's Vail resort after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe."

      "The brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing \"unhealthily fat\" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which a model appeared \"unhealthily thin\", was banned.",
      "The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness.",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin.",
      "But it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag.",
      "Catherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it \"hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity\".",
      "The 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme.",
      "Mrs Thom says she was \"bombarded with images of obese girls in tights\" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant.",
      "\"I see Snag tights plastering these morbidly obese people all over social media,\" she says.",
      "\"How is that allowed when the photo of the Next model isn't? There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful.\"",
      "'Fat phobia'",
      "But Snag founder Ms Read says: \"Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health.\"",
      "She thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\".",
      "Of her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\".",
      "\"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says.",
      "\"You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented.\"",
      "Sophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media.",
      "\"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people.\"",
      "Sophie is used to online comments telling her she is \"unhealthy\", but says, \"fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels.",
      "\"People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'. Perhaps some people are looking at me and saying 'she has a similar body type to me'.",
      "\"When I get a message from someone saying 'we are the same size and you've inspired me to wear what I want', it takes away from every hate comment I get.",
      "\"If I've helped one person accept their body then the hate comments don't really bother me.\"",
      "Fashion journalist Victoria Moss believes the \"depressing\" debate shows society is not used to seeing bigger bodies in advertising campaigns.",
      "\"You'd be pretty hard pushed to find genuine plus-size models on retailers' websites because even a mid-size is a 10/12 and plus is 14/16 which is actually around the average size for a woman in the UK,\" she says.",
      "\"The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter.\"",
      "Jess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight.",
      "She says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight. Adverts simply promoting body confidence and using a model who is relevant to the product's size range would not be investigated.",
      "\"It's to do with the wider societal context. We know in the UK currently society tends to view thinness as aspirational and that's not the case for being overweight.\""

    "story": [
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, in a blow to the government ahead of its Spring Statement later this month.",
      "The economy contracted by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its key priority, but the weakness of the economy is expected to affect Chancellor Rachel Reeves's decisions as she seeks to meet her self-imposed rules on tax and spending.",
      "Reeves said the government needed to go \"further and faster\" on the economy, but the Conservatives accused it of being a \"growth killer\".",
      "Economists had predicted the economy would grow by 0.1% in January, after 0.4% growth in December. Monthly readings can be volatile, and the ONS said the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.2% over the three months to January.",
      "But the overall picture for the UK was one of weak growth, said Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics.",
      "Construction and oil and gas extraction had a weak month, she said.",
      "But this was partially offset by retail, particularly food shops, \"as people ate and drank at home more\", she said.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for some time.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "In addition, firms are facing new uncertainty surrounding the tariffs being imposed by US President Donald Trump, while the government is also under pressure to increase defence spending.",
      "Responding to the latest growth figures, Reeves said: \"The world has changed and across the globe we are feeling the consequences.\"",
      "She said the government was \"launching the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War\", but this comes as public spending plans are under pressure as the chancellor seeks to meet self-imposed budget rules.",
      "Last month, the Bank of England halved its growth forecast for the UK this year. At the Spring Statement later this month, the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility is also likely to downgrade its growth prediction.",
      "This has led to expectations that government spending will have to be reined in so that Reeves can meet her tax and spending rules.",
      "The government is expected to set out significant cuts to the welfare budget next week, as part of these cost savings.",
      "What is GDP?",
      "What is GDP?",
      "Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Labour government was \"a growth killer\" after raising taxes and \"crushing business with their extreme employment legislation\".",
      "Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, said Reeves's plan for growth leaves the economy \"on life support\", with tax changes \"set to hammer small businesses\".",
      "Tax changes 'will be tough'",
      "John Dipre, the owner of Ashstead Park garden centre near Epsom in Surrey, said that changes to National Insurance contributions, less help with rates, and an increased minimum wage will \"hit us hard\".",
      "\"It's going to be very tough,\" he said. \"If you really want to support growth, you need to be supporting small businesses, that's what England's all about.\"",

      "Bank cuts interest rates and slashes growth forecast",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Yael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said predictions of \"sluggish growth\" mean Reeves will probably \"tighten purse strings\" in the Spring Statement.",
      "The recent cut to UK aid to fund an increase in defence spending \"is a preview that some departments will see their spending plans squeezed\", she added.",
      "Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said a slight rise or fall in GDP for one month was not significant, but the important point was the economy overall is \"quite weak and therefore quite vulnerable\".",
      "Car manufacturers in particular have \"notable weaknesses\" with trade uncertainty from Trump tariffs, and \"chopping and changing in the targets of the adoption of electric vehicles\".",
      "She said the UK growth figures \"certainly won't help\" in the lead-up to the Spring Statement."

      "The price of gold has hit the $3,000 per ounce mark for the first time as demand for the precious metal surges amid economic uncertainty over the impact of a global trade war.",
      "Gold touched a record $3,004.86 per ounce on Friday, with prices having risen by 14% since the start of 2025.",
      "Gold is seen as a safer asset for investors and is often sought after in times of economic instability.",
      "The escalating trade war between the US and many of its largest trading partners has unsettled financial markets and raised concerns about the impact on economies and consumers across the world.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes charged on businesses importing goods from overseas, has fuelled fears of price inflation, which has driven investors to gold.",
      "When tariffs are imposed on goods, businesses face extra costs, which could be passed on through the price tags of the products sold to consumers - increasing the cost of living.",
      "On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of the trade war.",
      "The announcement was in response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of the bloc's first retaliation to Trump's blanket tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US from any country.",
      "The US president has also raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "\"In a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing tariff changes, appetite for gold remains strong,\" said Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered.",
      "Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested there were two main drivers behind the gold price at present.",
      "\"Between Trump's tariffs and social media comments and the ongoing tensions in both the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine, uncertainty is high and seems to be rising,\" she said.",
      "\"Markets hate uncertainty. This dynamic has helped to drive the gold price to new highs.\"",
      "The second big driver was central banks buying up gold, Ms Hasler said, but the exact reasons for this were difficult to determine. \"It's probably safe to assume that at least part of the reason is a desire to diversify reserves away from US dollars.",
      "\"Both of the above drivers remain intact and I can't see them diminishing in the near future.\"",
      "Peaks and troughs of the gold price have occurred at some of the key moments in economic history. At the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007, investors bought gold as a haven asset, which led to a rise in its price.",
      "Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, cited World Gold Council figures, which showed central banks had added some 1,045 tonnes of gold to their reserves last year - the third year in a row more than 1,000 tonnes had been bought.",
      "He said we were in an \"era in which gold is really starting to shine\".",
      "Since the metal dipped below $1,200 an ounce in late 2018, Mr Mould said prices had \"marched inexorably higher\", driven by several factors including the Covid pandemic and higher government deficits pushing investors to \"warm to gold once more\".",
      "\"Quite which of these issues is now the main driver of gold's renaissance is hard to divine, especially as Donald Trump's tariffs are prompting a debate about how inflationary (or stagflationary) they may prove to be, and how effective they may be at funding the new US President's hoped-for tax cuts,\" he said."

      "Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has called the current benefits system unsustainable, indefensible and unfair, and said the government could not \"shrug its shoulders and look away\".",
      "But how the cuts are made and how far they go has created unease.",
      "MPs on the left of the party have called for wealth taxes rather than welfare cuts, but that is a non-starter with the chancellor.",

      "And there are some who have been privately advocating more flexibility on her fiscal rules to stave off painful cuts.",
      "Reeves's self-imposed rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy, require day-to-day government costs to be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing; and to get debt falling as a share of national income over a five year period.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "Taxpayers and the pension schemes of Thames Water workers would both suffer if the UK's largest water company was temporarily nationalised, the water regulator and Thames' pension trustees have warned.",
      "Ofwat has not disputed that placing Thames under government control in the event the debt-laden company collapsed could end up costing taxpayers billions of pounds.",
      "Some 12,000 current and former employees could also see future pension entitlements reduced, according to documents seen by the BBC.",
      "The future of Thames Water is in the balance as the Court of Appeal considers whether a \u00a33bn emergency loan to the troubled utility giant can go ahead.",
      "Thames and the majority of its lenders have backed a plan that would see the company, which has a \u00a320bn debt pile, borrow a further \u00a33bn to keep it afloat long enough to complete a restructure.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. It is expected to run out of cash completely by mid-April.",
      "The \u00a33bn rescue loan was approved following a crucial High Court battle last month, but a smaller group of lenders worried they stood to lose the most and Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard, who argued that piling on more debt was not in the public interest, launched an appeal.",

      "In a letter to the court, the water regulator insisted that Thames would be barred from recovering any additional interest payments from customer bills.",
      "It said that it had seen \"no evidence to support\" a figure put forward by Maynard that administration would cost the government as little as \u00a366m.",
      "The regulator did not comment on Thames's estimate that it would cost taxpayers up to \u00a34bn.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said government intervention in Thames Water would \"cost billions and take years\".",
      "Separately, the trustees for some 12,000 Thames Water pension scheme members have expressed concern that they \"could be significantly and detrimentally impacted\" should the company enter administration.",
      "If Thames were to collapse, those members would likely be transferred to the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund, which provides lower future benefits than those promised by the original scheme.",
      "Thames is hoping that the additional \u00a33bn in borrowing will provide it with enough time to start addressing the many problems it has.",
      "The company has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The company's first priority, if the loan is approved, would be to reduce its huge debt pile, by requiring lenders to accept a discount in what they are owed.",
      "Second would be to appeal a decision by Ofwat that it can only raise bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years. Thames has argued it needs to increase by 53% over the period.",
      "Its third move, which is connected to both of the above, would be to attract new investors to pump money into a business that has attracted public anger and regulatory fines.",
      "While the government, the regulator and the pension trustees are keen to avoid a collapse, there are many who think that Thames Water needs to be put out of its misery - rather than lurching from one financial and operational crisis to another.",

      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",

      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",

      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",

      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",

    "summary": "Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.",
      "The tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union.",
      "Economists have warned the US tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "Some cars are among the products given a temporary reprieve by Trump from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "When this ends, cars are expected to go up in price - by about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "Many well-known car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors and Honda trade parts and vehicles across the three countries.",
      "The cost of the higher taxes due on imported components is likely to be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said TD Economics' Andrew Foran.",
      "He argued that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.",
      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "The picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s.",
      "Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises.",
      "The bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "The \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",
      "Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive.",

      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

      "AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",
      "So what can we do to minimise our footprints?",
      "Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.",
      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",
      "It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.",
      "\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.",

      "\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"",

    "summary": "The controversial cafe chain is expanding outside London but locals often have mixed feelings.",
    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",

Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",

      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "Recent bursary changes in some shortage subjects has increased the supply of teachers in some areas. Starting salaries also recently increased to \u00a330,000, while teachers received an average pay rise of 5.5% last year, fully funded by the government.",

      "The NFER's school workforce lead, Jack Worth, says more students are now being taught by unqualified or non-specialist teachers, with the impact felt more acutely by students living in disadvantaged areas.",
      "\"The spending review in June is a real now or never moment. Not taking that opportunity will really risk not delivering [on the 6,500 promise] and not having anything to show the electorate at the end of the parliament.\"",

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",

In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",

      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",

      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",

      "\"I understand there could be changes to conditions, but that's what reviews are for - you shouldn't just have your money stopped at 16 when you are not old enough for the process.\"",

      "\u2022 It is not means-tested and aims to fund the extra living costs associated with having a disability",
      "\u2022 Assessments focus on how capable someone is of living independently and use a series of questions about daily activities",
      "\u2022 Points are awarded based on the individual's abilities and what help they need",
      "\u2022 Those points are added up to determine whether the threshold for a claim is met",
      "\u2022 A third party - like a parent or carer - can apply to represent someone without the capacity to do so themselves",
      "A recent Resolution Foundation report found the number of young people in receipt of disability benefits falls significantly between the ages of 15 and 17.",

      "Euan's claim was refused, but the decision was eventually overturned and he was granted PIP's highest rates when Ms Donley took the DWP to a tribunal.",

      "The dispute stems from July 2022, when the BBC announced plans to merge its domestic and international news channels, resulting in a recruitment process for five chief presenters.",
      "The women claimed that ahead of the announcement, the BBC's channels senior editor privately assured four other presenters - two men and two younger women - their jobs were safe.",
      "\"We were put through a pre-determined job application process in February 2023,\" the presenters said in court documents during a preliminary hearing last year.",
      "As a result, they said they were not recruited as chief presenters and were instead offered roles as correspondents, which in effect meant a demotion and a pay cut.",
      "The presenters called the recruitment process \"a sham\" exercise, \"where our jobs were closed even though the redundancies were not genuine as the work still exists\".",

      "Analysis",
      "By Katie Razzall, BBC News culture and media editor",
      "So who's won?",
      "The BBC has not admitted liability. In other words, it has not accepted it did anything wrong.",
      "The presenters remain in their current roles. Apart from McVeigh, who was appointed a chief presenter on the BBC News channel in February 2024, the others will not return to the full presenter roles they had and then lost in the restructuring recruitment process, which sparked two years of attrition.",
      "Through that lens, it looks like a stalemate.",
      "The losers, though, are licence fee payers who have seen hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on BBC presenters who were off work on full pay for at least a year, on top of whatever the costs of this settlement add up to. That may never be made public.",
      "The pressure is on to justify the financial waste.",
      "Why did it take so long to reach an agreement?",
      "Both sides were entrenched. For two years, they were in conflict, with the presenters off screen for half of that time.",
      "Contracts are binding. Employees remain on full pay while internal disputes are resolved. But this one took a long time, and they continued to fight when they returned to work. Only, on the brink of the tribunal, was there a resolution.",
      "The BBC will have had licence fee payers in mind when weighing up whether to proceed to a full tribunal or settle. It apparently decided it wasn't worth going through three damaging weeks, with all the headlines and media attention that would have generated.",
      "A settlement is always likely to bring down costs. The impact of a tribunal can be substantial, and there is also the potential for appeals and further hearings that increase the financial impact.",
      "But the optics of the last two years, ending in a settlement, aren't good. And there is frustration inside the BBC about the impact of it all, at a time when budgets are shrinking."

      "Dwarfism debate",
      "The debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\".",

      "Halle Bailey, a black actress, was cast in another recent Disney live-action movie, The Little Mermaid. Both actresses faced abuse online after their casting was announced.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Elsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has publicly taken a pro-Palestine stance, whilst Gadot is Israeli and served in the country's army for two years.",

      "Stranger Things actress Sadie Sink is set to appear in Spider Man 4, according to US  reports.",
      "Hollywood publication Deadline said she had been cast in the sequel opposite returning star Tom Holland.",
      "There is no word yet on which character she might play, but fans have speculated she could be introduced as X-Men mutant Jean Grey.",
      "The reports have not yet been confirmed by Marvel Studios or Sony Pictures, who are due to release the film in July 2026.",
      "In Hollywood, it's normal for casting news to be reported in trade publications before the studio confirms it.",
      "This can be for a variety of reasons - it may be that an actor is in final talks but has not yet signed on the dotted line, or casting news is sometimes leaked by the studio to see how fans will respond, or by an actor's agent to generate excitement.",
      "However, in a few cases, the actor and studio decide not to proceed - so until we hear official news, it's still possible Sink may not be cast.",
      "Spoiler warning: This section features plot details of the most recent Spider-Man film.",
      "The most recent Spider-Man film, 2021's No Way Home, was a huge box office success, grossing $1.9bn worldwide.",
      "The movie ended with Parker accidentally breaking open the multiverse and allowing two previous Spider-Men, played by Tobey MaGuire and Andrew Garfield, to return, with all three existing at the same time.",
      "As a result, Holland's Spider-Man decided to complete Doctor Strange's spell that erases his identity from the world, meaning his girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) would forget he had ever existed.",
      "Given the way the plot is likely to develop, Deadline said there would porbably be several new actors such as Sink added to the ensemble cast as a new collection of characters are brought in.",
      "Holland is currently filming The Odyssey, the latest film from Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, but is expected to move on to Spider-Man when shooting concludes.",
      "Sink's reported casting comes after she finished shooting the final season of Stranger Things, the horror series that has been one of Netflix's biggest hits since its launch in 2016.",
      "The show helped launch or boost the careers of several young stars, including Sink, Millie Bobby Brown, Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard.",

      "And this comes as retail theft and violence and abuse towards shop workers is rising, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).",
      "Based on the latest weighted BRC-Opinium survey with 2,000 participants, the BRC estimates almost a quarter (24%) of the UK population witnessed shoplifting in the 12 months to February 2025.",
      "In Meet the Shoplifters, Dooley asks shoplifters about their motivations. Some see it as an act of defiance against big corporations, while others say they find it \"really degrading\" but do it to get things like nappies and milk for their children.",
      "One shoplifter Dooley spoke to, for example, was a mother stealing milk and bread to feed her child. \"She was riddled with guilt,\" Dooley says of the mother. \"It was out of sheer desperation.\"",
      "Tom Holder from the BRC says shoplifting in the UK is becoming worse and worse, adding: \"We're now just reaching new heights. People think that they can get away with it, without consequence.\"",

      "Dooley spoke to retail worker Dips, who works in a cosmetics store in Manchester, and says \"as each year has gone on, it's got worse for us\".",
      "\"It's not a victimless crime. Somebody always pays the price for it down the line. And for us, it's the staff in here,\" she adds.",
      "Dooley also explains how shoplifting is being documented on social media. \"We've seen shop assistants be, you know, verbally abused, physically abused,\" she says.",
      "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, adds that while an incident can be \"over in a matter of seconds\", it can have \"life-long consequences\" on those who experience it, making them think twice about visiting their local high streets.",
      "When speaking to shoplifters, Dooley says some of them \"don't even see it as a crime, necessarily\".",
      "And she adds that on social media, some people use hashtags to offer other shoplifters advice.",
      "But shoplifting cost UK retailers \u00a32bn in one year, according to a recent estimate.",

    "summary": "The figures come as debate continues about how much money artists and songwriters receive in royalties.",
    "story": [
      "Spotify paid the music industry $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) in 2024, which the streaming service said was the highest annual payment from any single retailer in history.",
      "But the figures come as a heated debate continues about how much money artists and songwriters receive in royalties.",
      "Earlier this year, several Grammy-nominated songwriters boycotted an awards event hosted by Spotify in a row about their streaming earnings.",
      "As the new figures were published, a spokesperson for Spotify said the responsibility for distributing the money it pays lay with record labels and publishers.",
      "The company said it pays royalties to rights holders, adding that it does not have \"visibility\" on where the money ultimately goes because earnings are based on artists' individual contracts with their labels.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"Spotify does not pay artists or songwriters directly. We pay rights-holders, these are typically record labels, music publishers, collection societies.",
      "\"These rights-holders then pay artists and songwriters based on their individual agreements.\"",
      "The amount of money earned by artists will vary, but the BPI noted the average royalty rate for UK artists signed to major labels was around 26%, according to a 2021 study from the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "As a result, the performer ultimately earns about 16% of a stream's overall value.",
      "However, Spotify is not the only streaming service to generate revenue for artists, and many pop stars make more money from other income streams such as live tours.",
      "Spotify said more than two-thirds of all music revenue goes \"straight to the recording and publishing rights-holders\", and added that, like other streamers, Spotify does not pay on a per-stream basis.",
      "The annual figures were published in Spotify's Loud and Clear report - part of the company's aim to provide transparency on how it pays the music industry.",
      "The amount Spotify paid this year was an increase on the more than $9bn (\u00a37bn) it handed over in 2023.",
      "The report highlighted that the number of artists generating annual royalties between $1,000 (\u00a3770) and $10m had tripled since 2017.",
      "Taylor Swift was named Spotify's top artist globally with more than 26 billion streams, in the year she released her double-length album The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.",
      "Swift herself was part of the debate about streaming royalties in 2014, when she removed her music from Spotify as part of a boycott, eventually re-joining the platform in 2017.",
      "More recent artist boycotts have generally been prompted by other factors, such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell removing their music over the streamer's employment of podcast host Joe Rogan. Both artists returned to the platform last year.",
      "But dissatisfaction over streaming royalties continues.",
      "A large-scale survey of musicians in Europe carried out last year found that about 70% were unhappy with the amount they were paid in streaming revenue.",

    "story": [
      "Miniature models of Belfast's lost theatres created by set designer Stuart Marshall are bringing the city's vibrant theatre history back into the the limelight.",
      "They are part of an exhibition at Ulster University for the Children's Festival.",
      "Mr Marshall told BBC News NI that the models, which are made from cardboard, have a cross generational appeal.",
      "\"Children appreciate the miniature dolls house type model making, adults appreciate the skill that goes into making them, and older people who may remember when some of these places still stood.\"",
      "Lockdown project",
      "\"It all started as a lockdown project,\" Mr Marshall told BBC News NI.",
      "\"I started working on a model of the Grand Opera House as part of the heritage exhibition and through doing that got interested in looking at all the other theatres that aren't about anymore.\"",
      "The models are \"mostly made of different types of cardboard, like mounting card or coloured paper and then they're glued together\".",
      "\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"",
      "He said he mostly works from old photographs, but it can be hard to get enough accurate detail because \"with a black and white photograph that you can't move around, it's basically static\".",
      "When photographs of the old theatres are not available or poor quality, Mr Marshall refers to old newspaper articles which sometimes have written descriptions of what materials the theatre was built from and how it appeared.",
      "The Alhambra - 'quite a rowdy place'",
      "Opening in the early 1870s, the Alhambra was Belfast's first music hall and was a \"real spit on the floor type joint\", according to Mr Marshall.",
      "\"In the early days, the Alhambra was more of a variety house, and I've heard that it wasn't the most enticing establishment, quite a rowdy place.",
      "\"The Alhambra didn't cater for the more refined clientele,\" he added.",
      "A typical bill from the early days of the Alhambra shows performances which \"would nowadays be contentious\" included events such as a minstrel show and a Japanese troupe.",
      "\"I've seen other things listed, which were more overtly racist, but that was kind of the way at the time,\" he added.",
      "To adapt to the evolution of mass entertainment, the Alhambra converted to a full time cinema house in 1936.",
      "Between the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires.",
      "The Theatre Royal - 'higher class establishment'",
      "The Theatre Royal was Belfast's original high-end theatre, opening in the late 1700s with a capacity of just over 1,000.",
      "The building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.",
      "\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"",
      "The Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\".",
      "\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.",
      "The Empire - 'stayed true to theatre'",
      "Not to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894.",
      "According to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.",
      "\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\"",
      "While it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said.",
      "The Hippodrome - 'Cinema in mind'",
      "The Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\".",
      "Mr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale.",
      "Coming quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows.",
      "The Ritz - 'The Stones, The Beatles...'",
      "\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938.",
      "The Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment.",
      "\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"",
      "\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added.",
      "It was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity.",
      "The Ritz was damaged by bombs hidden in the seats and the theatres interior and roof was destroyed in 1977.",

    "summary": "The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",
      "\"It breaks my heart he was alone so long.\"",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",

    "story": [
      "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.",
      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

      "The government said work would begin immediately to return many of NHS England's current functions to the Department of Health and Social Care, with the aim of completing the process in two years.",

      "It was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, with the aim of freeing the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the changes would \"liberate\" frontline workers from excessive and \"competing directions\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said the result would be \"better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients because the hundreds of millions of pounds we can save will be redeployed to the front line delivering better care\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",

      "Liberal Democrat  leader Sir Ed Davey backed the plans, but argued they were not the main issue for the NHS.",
      "To fix it, the government needed to focus on \"getting more GPs, more NHS dentists, more community pharmacists, making sure that social care actually works\", he said.",
      "The Health Foundation think tank warned the reorganisation would distract senior leaders.",
      "And Sharon Graham, head of the Unite union, said: \"Taking an axe to these jobs is an ill-thought-out strategy that could end up meaning frontline healthcare staff struggle to do their jobs effectively if they aren't paid on time, don't have basic medical supplies or are forced to do additional administrative work rather than treat patients.\"",

      "The announcement came as part of a wider speech on reforming the state, which Sir Keir described as \"overstretched\" and \"unfocused\".",
      "\"Over a number of years politicians have chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos, arm's length bodies, regulators, reviews,\" the prime minister said.",
      "\"A sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers using taxpayer money to stop the government delivering on taxpayer priorities.\"",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "They include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, ranging from large organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",

      "The government has also suggested it wants to cut the size of the Civil Service, which has a headcount of more than 500,000.",
      "Civil servants are politically impartial officials employed by the government, covering areas including policy development and services like benefits and prisons.",
      "In his speech, Sir Keir linked the need to reshape government to global instability which has pushed up bills at home, saying the state needs to be operating at \"maximum strength\".",
      "He promised to cut the costs of regulation for businesses by 25% to boost economic growth.",
      "His plan also includes greater use of artificial intelligence, underpinned by the mantra that civil servants should not be spending time on tasks where digital or AI can do it better and quicker.",
      "Earlier this year, Sir Keir faced a backlash saying \"too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "In his speech he was keen to stress his criticism was not aimed at individuals but the system as a whole.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:39:07 GMT",
    "summary": "There are three main reasons body is going - money, bureaucracy and control, says Nick Triggle",
    "story": [
      "The body responsible for the day-to-day running of the health service in England is being scrapped.",
      "The government plans to abolish NHS England and bring it into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "Why? The government argues it will save money, cut red-tape and give ministers more control. But the move is not without risk.",
      "With more than 14,000 staff, NHS England is around four times the size of the DHSC itself.",
      "But that is only because in recent years NHS England has absorbed Health Education England, which oversees staff training, and NHS Digital, which is responsible for data collection and technology.",
      "NHS England also plays a role in organising some key frontline services, including GPs and specialist hospital care, while overseeing the day-to-day running of the health service alongside distributing the money made available by ministers.",
      "Much of this will now fall under the control of the health department. But not all. Expect some to be devolved down to regional health boards.",
      "Nonetheless, it is expected to lead to half of the jobs at the two organisations going \u2013 around 9,000 roles.",
      "That is expected to save at least \u00a3500m a year. While the sum sounds a lot, it is around 0.25% of the health budget. The respected King's Fund think-tank has called it a \"drop in the ocean\" that will not go very far on the frontline.",
      "Bureaucratic monster",
      "But this is also about reducing bureaucracy \u2013 something that can't really be measured in numbers.",
      "In his address to the House of Commons, Streeting cited one organisation that was having to fill in 250 forms in one month to satisfy both the health department and NHS England.",
      "Reacting to the announcement on Thursday, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC NHS England has become a \"bureaucratic monster\" that stifles innovation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "And talk to those doing the work in hospitals and other frontline services, one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews.",
      "But make no mistake this is also about control. It was a point made clear by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer when he set out the plan, which could take two years to fully implement.",
      "He said it was only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "Significant risk",
      "Quangos - \"quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations\" - are set up by government to oversee regulations and operate independently from politicians.",
      "NHS England was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley.",
      "The idea was to free the health service from political meddling \u2013 with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis.",
      "In the years afterwards NHS England has exercised that independence. This was  most notable under the leadership of Sir Simon Stevens, who challenged and pressed the Theresa May government into increasing funding.",
      "In the late 2010s, after Lansley had left government, Conservative health ministers privately expressed frustration that the single-biggest part of their brief was outside of their control.",
      "As soon as Streeting took charge at the DHSC last summer, it was clear he felt the same and NHS England was on borrowed time.",
      "On Monday it was announced half of the roles at NHS England would go \u2013 and that came after the current chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and a number of her top managers announced they would be stepping down.",
      "But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk. Hospital bosses are already warning this will cause disruption.",
      "And the public are understandably asking what difference this will make to the care they receive. The government says it will help it improve services and reduce waiting times \u2013 and, given that is one of its top priorities, there will be no hiding place now."

    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",

      "Children should completely avoid \"slushy\" ice drinks containing glycerol, which can make them very ill, until they are at least eight years old, say researchers calling for official health advice to change.",
      "The researchers studied the cases of 21 two-to-seven-year-olds in the UK and Ireland who needed emergency treatment soon after drinking a slushy product.",
      "The brightly coloured drinks are designed to appeal to children - but most contain the naturally occurring sweetener glycerol, instead of sugar, to stop them freezing solid and give the slushy effect.",
      "Current Food Standards Agency (FSA) advice says under-fives should avoid the drinks and under-11s should have no more than one.",

      "Parents not aware",
      "Lead study author Professor Ellen Crushell, from Dublin, warned that the 21 cases looked at in the study could be the \"tip of the iceberg\", although she stressed that thousands of children drink slushies worldwide every day without suffering ill-effects.",
      "There could be a \"milder cohort\" who may not need hospital treatment but still suffer symptoms such as \"nausea and vomiting\", she added.",
      "The paediatricians behind the study - all working in the UK and Ireland - say it's difficult for parents to work out how much glycerol is contained in slushy ice drinks.",
      "Recommendations based on a child's weight are hard for parents to interpret, they say, and how quickly a slushy is drunk and whether it's taken with a meal or after exercise can also be factors in the side-effects experienced.",
      "\"Estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy,\" the researchers say, who recommend changing the advice based on a child's age instead.",
      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",
      "In countries with no sugar tax, they contain much more glucose and often no glycerol at all, the authors say.",
      "Rebecca Sudworth, director of policy at the Food Standards Agency, said it was considering the finding of the review \"carefully\".",
      "\"We continue to strongly encourage parents to follow [our] advice which is that slushie drinks should not be given to children under four years old. Retailers are also advised to make parents fully aware of this guidance.\"",

    "title": "Doctors didn't warn women of 'risky sex' drug urges",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:36:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Patients given drugs for movement disorders like restless leg syndrome say their behaviour changed entirely.",
    "story": [
      "Patients prescribed drugs for movement disorders - including restless leg syndrome (RLS) - say doctors did not warn them about serious side effects that led them to seek out risky sexual behaviour.",
      "Twenty women have told the BBC that the drugs - given to them for RLS, which causes an irresistible urge to move - ruined their lives.",
      "A report by drugs firm GSK - seen by the BBC - shows it learned in 2003 of a link between the medicines, known as dopamine agonist drugs, and what it described as \"deviant\" sexual behaviour. It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",
      "While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a general warning about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of \"altered\" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.",
      "Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than \u00a3150,000.",
      "Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.",
      "The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.",
      "\"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant,\" she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.",
      "Claire says she began leaving her house in the early hours of the morning to cruise for sex. Wearing a see-through top and jacket, she would flash her chest at any man she could find. She did this regularly, she says, and in increasingly dangerous locations, despite having a partner.",
      "\"There remains an element in your head that knows what you're doing is wrong, but it affects you to the point that you don't know you're doing it.\"",
      "Claire says it took years to connect these urges with her medication - and they disappeared almost immediately when she stopped taking it. She feels complete \"shame\" and is \"mortified\" at the danger she placed herself in.",
      "Listen to 5 Minutes On: The prescription drugs that gave me a gambling addiction",
      "Listen to 5 Minutes On: The prescription drugs that gave me a gambling addiction",
      "Impulsive behaviours, including gambling and increased sex drive, have long been listed as side effects in medicine leaflets for dopamine agonist drugs - and are thought to affect between 6% to 17% of RLS patients taking them, according to health guidance body NICE. A \"common\" side effect of any medicine can be considered to only affect as few as 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.",
      "The drugs work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the \"happy hormone\" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded.",
      "But agonist drugs can over-stimulate these feelings and under-stimulate the appreciation of consequences - leading to impulsive behaviour, according to academics.",
      "The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as \"deviant behaviour\"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.",
      "The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his \"libido problem subsequently resolved\" after his dose was reduced.",
      "In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out \"uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour\". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges \"intensified\" after the treatment.",
      "Prevalence rates of what GSK calls \"deviant\" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge.",
      "\"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication,\" she says.",
      "Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be \"devastating\".",
      "RLS is believed to affect about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men.",
      "The 20 sufferers we spoke to say not only had doctors failed to tell them of the potentially serious side effects of the drugs, but also failed to review the impact of the medication on their bodies subsequently.",
      "Sarah was in her 50s when she was prescribed another dopamine agonist drug made by a different manufacturer.",
      "\"Previously I'd have had no interest if Brad Pitt walked in the room naked,\" she says. \"But it turned me into this raging woman who kept taking sexual addiction further.\"",
      "Sarah began selling used underwear and videos of sex acts online - and organising telephone sex with strangers. She also began shopping compulsively - ending up with \u00a330,000 of debt.",
      "To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills. She ended up being admitted to rehab - but that meant her driving licence was taken away and she lost her job.",
      "\"I turned to things that weren't healthy - I knew that the behaviour wasn't me, but I couldn't control it,\" she tells the BBC.",

      "A third woman, Sue, says she was prescribed two different dopamine agonist drugs without being warned of compulsive behaviour side effects on either occasion. She even mentioned recent gambling behaviour when the second drug was prescribed, she says. She went on to rack up debts of \u00a380,000.",
      "\"The effect on my family was horrific - it was life-changing money to lose,\" she says. \"But at the time I didn't know it was no fault of my own.\"",
      "A class action was brought against GSK in 2011 by four sufferers of Parkinson's disease - the BBC has learned. They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships.",
      "They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability.",
      "Cases of serious side effects have also been reported in other countries, particularly in relation to the use of drugs for Parkinson's disease.",
      "In France, a court awarded damages to a father of two who complained that Ropinirole had given him compulsive homosexual urges, while another man without a criminal record began torturing cats.",
      "In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends the drugs should only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care.",
      "Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation.",
      "Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist, says the drugs still play an important role but he believes that drug companies, health authorities and doctors need to better warn patients of these side effects.",
      "\"Not everybody knows the kinds of really quite dramatic changes that can occur,\" he says.",

      "\"As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information,\" it said.",
      "In response to its 2003 research that had found a link with \"deviant\" sexual behaviour, GSK told us this was shared with health authorities and had informed updates in prescribing information - which now lists \"altered or increased sexual interest\" and \"behaviour of significant concern\" as side effects.",
      "The current patient information leaflet for Ropinirole makes specific reference to changes in sexual interest on five occasions - almost exclusively warning about the frequency or strength of such feelings as potentially \"abnormally high\", \"excessive\" or \"increase[d]\".",
      "The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said that while a specific reference to \"deviant\" sexual behaviour is not included in warnings, such impulses vary and a general warning about activities which may be harmful is included.",
      "It also said that it is important for healthcare professionals to explain the possible risk to patients and not all experience these types of side effects.",

    "story": [
      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

      "Sir Keir Starmer has called the current benefits system unsustainable, indefensible and unfair, and said the government could not \"shrug its shoulders and look away\".",
      "But how the cuts are made and how far they go has created unease.",
      "MPs on the left of the party have called for wealth taxes rather than welfare cuts, but that is a non-starter with the chancellor.",

      "And there are some who have been privately advocating more flexibility on her fiscal rules to stave off painful cuts.",
      "Reeves's self-imposed rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy, require day-to-day government costs to be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing; and to get debt falling as a share of national income over a five year period.",
      "The call to relax those rules has been fuelled by the decision of next German Chancellor Friedrich Merz \u2013 a centre-right politician \u2013 to exempt defence and infrastructure spending from the straitjacket of the country's \"debt brake\", which restricts borrowing.",

      "The chancellor is under great scrutiny ahead of her Spring Statement, against a backdrop of a stagnant economy.",
      "But those close to her believe her critics' suggestions also deserve scrutiny - and are forcefully pushing back on what they regard as unrealistic solutions.",
      "If the UK followed the German example, No11 officials believe this could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs \u2013 the budget of some entire departments \u2013 and would risk higher interest rates and mortgage payments.",
      "In other words, any hopes that some Labour MPs had that changes in the UK's defence posture would unlock more borrowing have been very firmly dashed.",

      "The door to No11 is going to remain closed to many of them.",
      "Government sources point out that backbench MPs have been meeting the No10 policy team, and work and pensions ministers,  who have listened to their questions and concerns.",
      "At ministerial level, there has also been some concern about the influence  of the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the umpire which decides if the government's figures add up and if there is  any 'headroom' in meeting fiscal rules.",
      "One source suggested that it has been given a \"god-like\" status, with its economic forecasts treated like tablets of stone.",
      "But Number 10 and Number 11 are both aware that any interference with this independent body would be politically toxic, inviting comparisons with Liz Truss, who ignored the OBR ahead of her disastrous mini-budget.",

    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.",
      "That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.",
      "And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.",
      "There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:",
      "Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "Cutting the level of benefit payments",
      "Tightening the eligibility for benefits",
      "Attempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.",
      "\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "Freezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.",
      "But you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.",
      "Also, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.",
      "Under previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.",
      "And from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "Rather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.",
      "For instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.",
      "\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.",
      "Encourage work",
      "Another way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.",
      "The OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).",
      "Another potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.",
      "Some advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",

      "The tiny creatures are just millimetres in size and thrive in rubble and post-industrial environments .",

      "In a speech in Hull, Sir Keir said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "The government said work would begin immediately to return many of NHS England's current functions to the Department of Health and Social Care, with the aim of completing the process in two years.",
      "The significant move gives the government more control and accountability over one of their key pledges - to cut NHS waiting times.",
      "NHS England - which the government dubbed \"the world's largest quango\" - oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services.",
      "It was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, with the aim of freeing the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the changes would \"liberate\" frontline workers from excessive and \"competing directions\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said the result would be \"better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients because the hundreds of millions of pounds we can save will be redeployed to the front line delivering better care\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",
      "She did not have \"high hopes\" because Labour already ran the NHS in Wales and that was \"doing a lot worse than the rest of the country\", she said.",
      "Liberal Democrat  leader Sir Ed Davey backed the plans, but argued they were not the main issue for the NHS.",
      "To fix it, the government needed to focus on \"getting more GPs, more NHS dentists, more community pharmacists, making sure that social care actually works\", he said.",
      "The Health Foundation think tank warned the reorganisation would distract senior leaders.",
      "And Sharon Graham, head of the Unite union, said: \"Taking an axe to these jobs is an ill-thought-out strategy that could end up meaning frontline healthcare staff struggle to do their jobs effectively if they aren't paid on time, don't have basic medical supplies or are forced to do additional administrative work rather than treat patients.\"",

      "The announcement came as part of a wider speech on reforming the state, which Sir Keir described as \"overstretched\" and \"unfocused\".",
      "\"Over a number of years politicians have chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos, arm's length bodies, regulators, reviews,\" the prime minister said.",
      "\"A sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers using taxpayer money to stop the government delivering on taxpayer priorities.\"",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "They include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, ranging from large organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "The water regulator Ofwat could be among other government quangos in line to be scrapped.",
      "Ofwat's role - along with the Environment Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Natural Resources Wales - is among the organisations already being looked at in a review of the whole water system in England and Wales, by an Independent Water Commission established last year.",
      "Government sources would not pre-empt the outcome of the review but all options for regulating water are understood to be on the table, except nationalising water companies.",

      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people to find jobs.",
      "The government has also suggested it wants to cut the size of the Civil Service, which has a headcount of more than 500,000.",
      "Civil servants are politically impartial officials employed by the government, covering areas including policy development and services like benefits and prisons.",
      "In his speech, Sir Keir linked the need to reshape government to global instability which has pushed up bills at home, saying the state needs to be operating at \"maximum strength\".",
      "He promised to cut the costs of regulation for businesses by 25% to boost economic growth.",
      "His plan also includes greater use of artificial intelligence, underpinned by the mantra that civil servants should not be spending time on tasks where digital or AI can do it better and quicker.",
      "Earlier this year, Sir Keir faced a backlash saying \"too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "In his speech he was keen to stress his criticism was not aimed at individuals but the system as a whole.",
      "Having spent the last few weeks focused on diplomatic wrangling over Ukraine, the speech saw the prime minister return to domestic challenges - specifically a feeling that services in the country do not work well enough.",
      "It also reflected growing concern in Downing Street that there are too many organisations that ministers can not directly control.",
      "For the public, the key question will be whether these changes result in any perceptible improvement.",
      "Former head of the Civil Service Lord [Gus] O'Donnell told the BBC the government's messaging to civil servants was \"nothing short of disastrous\".",
      "Speaking on Radio 4's PM programme, he referenced Sir Keir's \"tepid bath\" comment and a government briefing to the Guardian on Wednesday saying \"they wanted to do 'project chainsaw'. Trying to be a mini Elon Musk?\".",
      "He described these remarks as \"absolutely ridiculous\" and \"really damaging\" for the prime minister and what he wanted to achieve.",
      "Mike Clancy, head of the Prospect trade union, which represents civil servants, agreed reform was needed but added: \"The government must recognise that there is a fine line between cutting back bureaucracy and undermining the essential functions of the state.\"",
      "\"Civil servants in agencies such as HSE [Health and Safety Executive] and the Environment Agency are at the frontline of delivering on the government's missions - writing them off as 'blockers' is a profound mistake.\"",

      "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC).",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",

      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",
      "\"A major lesson from the Tory years is that austerity damaged the nation's health - we must not make the same mistake again.\"",

    "summary": "The measure is part of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced to Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",
      "\"We can't have nonsensical approaches that mean people's houses can't be built because of a stray cricket ball,\" Rayner said, adding: \"We need to have a common sense approach.\"",

      "Currently employees are eligible for parental bereavement leave if they or their partner have a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "Labour MP Sarah Owen, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, has been calling for this right to be extended in cases where miscarriages take place before 24 weeks.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, Madders said: \"Bereavement is not an illness, it's not a holiday and it does need its own special category.\"",
      "He added: \"I am grateful to the work of the Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.",
      "\"The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult personal experience and the inquiry they conducted demonstrated a clear gap in support for those who experience pregnancy loss and need time to recover and grieve.\"",
      "He said Owen had shown \"great bravery\" in speaking about her own experience of having a miscarriage.",
      "In 2021, Owen told MPs that after her own miscarriage she felt physically better in a few days but had \"all the classic signs\" of grieving.",
      "\"I could not eat, I could not sleep. I really did not hold much hope that life would ever get brighter,\" she said.",
      "Owen and her committee have proposed changes to the Employment Rights Bill which would ensure parents bereaved as a result of a pregnancy loss are entitled to two weeks of leave.",
      "During a debate on the bill on Tuesday, Madders said: \"We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as raised in the amendments, and we look forward to further discussions with [Owen] and [peers] as the Bill moves on to its next stages in the Lords.\"",
      "Owen said she was \"so pleased\" to hear the minister's commitment.",
      "Introducing a legal right to miscarriage bereavement leave would be \"a leading light in a world which seems to be taking a backward step in women's rights,\" she added.",
      "Vicki Robinson, CEO of the Miscarriage Association, said: \"We are extremely pleased to see, that for the first time ever, those experiencing pre-24-week pregnancy loss will be officially recognised in bereavement leave legislation.",
      "\"While we had been seeking paid leave, and the present commitment appears to be for unpaid leave, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward and provides long-overdue validation that this type of loss can be experienced as a bereavement like any other.\"",
      "Paid leave for bereaved parents is 'crucial'",
      "'I went back after 3 days': Calls for miscarriage bereavement leave",
      "How will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?",
      "The bill aims to strengthen workers' rights in areas including unfair dismissals, flexible working and sick pay.",
      "Opening the debate, Madders said it was a \"landmark bill\" that would \"tackle low pay, poor working conditions and poor job security\".",
      "Greg Smith, the Conservative shadow business minister, said he backed the government on bereavement leave for pregnancy loss but added that in the \"vast majority\" of the bill the government had got the balance between the rights employees and employers \"wrong\".",

      "The bill currently gives workers the right to paternity leave from day one of their employment, instead of the current 26 weeks.",

      "She said that was not long enough, adding that the UK had \"the worst\" paternity leave entitlement in the whole of the EU.",
      "Madders said the government would be holding a review of the parental leave system, which would be separate from the bill.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to slash the costs of regulation with an \"active government\".",
      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",

      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",

      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "Nicola Sturgeon remains the biggest name in Scottish politics.",
      "She was a player in UK politics in a way that neither of her successors could expect to be.",
      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",

      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",
      "Then there was her attempt to realign Scottish politics by forming a power-sharing partnership with the Greens to achieve political stability for the Scottish government.",

      "What will be her legacy?",
      "She was the first minister who expanded early learning and childcare and used new welfare powers to introduce a weekly child payment unique to Scotland - policies she would regard as significant achievements.",
      "While opposition parties say they would maintain these benefits, financial watchdogs warn that the extent of health and social welfare spending in Scotland is unsustainable.",
      "All of this is part of the Sturgeon legacy to be debated as she counts down to her departure from the Scottish Parliament in just over a year.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon famously made decisions in a very tight circle and according to one adviser her decision-making group became ever smaller.",
      "By the end, this source said she was operating in \"a circle of one\".",
      "It was ultimately her decision to leave high office just as it is now hers to leave frontline politics altogether.",
      "As she has noted herself in the past, Nicola Sturgeon is a public figure loved and loathed in almost equal measure but there can be few who would doubt that politics will be a duller place without her presence."

    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are expected on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The government is also seeking to reorganise the civil service to reduce bureaucracy. It has already announced that NHS England will be scrapped, and other quangos and regulators are also expected to be axed.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system.",
      "Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months.",
      "Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:27:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says it cannot accept any new applications for its key green farming funding scheme.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",
      "The government said SFI had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed, but it would not accept any new applications. No replacement has been announced.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",
      "Mr Bradshaw said the sudden closure would force farmers to decide \"whether to turn their backs on environmental work and just farm as hard as they can to survive\".",
      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",
      "She told BBC News she is now \"angry, frustrated and apprehensive about the future\".",
      "\"You spend time making plans based on the best information you have but then that plan I made is now pointless. It's a waste of time and that must be multiplied all around the country, whether it's farmers or nature charities who are managing land and using similar schemes.",
      "\"It just feels like we are being punched at from every angle possible,\" she explained.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",
      "It said that in total, more than 50,000 farm businesses - covering half of all farmed land - were now benefiting from wider environmental land management schemes (Elms).",
      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",
      "It added that a \"new and improved\" SFI, which will have a capped budget, will be set up but its details will not be announced until later in the year.",
      "Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said: \"This government is proud to have set the biggest budget for sustainable food produce in history.",
      "\"More farmers are now in schemes and more money is being spent through them than ever before. That is true today and will remain true tomorrow.\"",
      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",
      "He said the closure was \"delivered yet again with no warning, no understanding of the industry and a complete lack of compassion or care\".",
      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",
      "\"This has left many farmers feeling frustrated and let down, with no clear opportunity to be rewarded for delivering public goods in the near future,\" he said.",

      "It's still too early to tell whether it will have a major impact, and weather conditions in coming days will be a major factor.",
      "But a lot will depend on exactly which toxic chemicals have been spilled and how much of them.",
      "Cargo ship still on fire after collision as owners say no sodium cyanide on board",
      "North Sea tanker collision - what we know so far",
      "What might be on board?",
      "Maritime operations company, Crowley, which was managing the oil tanker the MV Stena Immaculate, has confirmed that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 containers at the time of the incident.",
      "It was not clear on the status of all the containers but Crowley said one had \"ruptured\" and was leaking fuel into the sea.",
      "The contents of the cargo ship, the Solong, which crashed into the tanker have been less clear.",
      "Lloyds List, a shipping data company, said on Monday that it was carrying sodium cyanide.",
      "But on Tuesday Ernst Russ, owners of the cargo ship said: \"We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board ladened with sodium cyanide.",

      "It remains unclear if the ship was carrying other contents at the time of the crash.",
      "What are the dangers of jet fuel and sodium cyanide?",
      "Jet fuel is a toxic substance that can be lethal to marine organisms and other animals like seabirds if ingested.",
      "The level of toxicity is dependent on the crude oil that it has been refined from.",
      "Sodium cyanide, which is used in industry including for metal cleaning, is a also a toxic substance and poisonous for living organisms as it disrupts cell function and leads to oxygen starvation.",
      "Sodium cyanide is also highly soluble in water and it can react vigorously to produce the gas hydrogen cyanide - which is also toxic.",
      "The confirmation that it was only empty containers on board will allay some concerns about environmental damage and make the clean-up operation easier.",
      "The third consideration for authorities will be whether the fuel used to run both ships - the bunker fuel - has also leaked out.",
      "Marine fuel is a lot heavier than jet fuel and can remain in the environment for longer.",
      "Alex Lukyanov at the University of Reading, UK, said. \"Marine diesel can smother habitats and wildlife, affecting their ability to regulate body temperature, potentially resulting in death.\"",
      "\"The environmental toll could be severe,\" he said.",
      "Graham Stuart, the local MP for Beverley and Holderness, said on Tuesday that it appears \"there is no evidence so far of any of the heavy engine oil leaking from either ship\". But he added that this is still possible.",
      "What mitigation can be taken?",
      "The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is overseeing the operation to respond to the incident and clean up any pollution.",
      "Melanie Onn, the MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is currently doing an evaluation of the contamination risk and working with the owners of both of the vessels to plan a salvage operation.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar.

      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 01:26:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",

      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

      "What Apple pulling Advanced Data Protection means for you",
      "The row began in February when it first emerged the government was seeking the right to be able to access data protected by ADP, using powers granted to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "The Act allows it to covertly compel firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "ADP allows users with iCloud accounts and storage to secure photos, notes, voice memos and other data with end to end encryption, meaning no-one but the user - not even Apple - can access it.",

      "\"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "Later in February the row escalated, as Apple announced it was pulling ADP in the UK.",
      "Shortly after that, the BBC learnt Apple was taking legal action by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to try to overturn the government's demand.",
      "On its website, the Tribunal lists a hearing to be held before its president Lord Justice Singh on Friday afternoon.",
      "The listing makes no mention of Apple or the government, nor has the Tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved - however a source familiar with the matter has indicated that is the case, as was first reported by Computer Weekly.",
      "In the statement it issued in February, Apple said it regretted the action it felt it had been forced to take.",

      "\"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\"",

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says.",
      "\"I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash.\"",

      "The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development.",
      "On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to.",
      "ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers.",
      "Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken.",
      "The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, \"waging war on Lazarus\".",
      "ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible.",
      "All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group.",
      "If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime.",
      "So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers.",
      "But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money.",
      "\"North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,\" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said.",

      "Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out.",
      "More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange.",
      "But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that.",
      "He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack.",
      "He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency.",
      "North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain.",

      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",

      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",

      "\"We are very fundamentally a different country,\" he said, later adding the notion is \"crazy\".",

      "The charges relate to an ambush and firefight that occurred in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, which killed 22 Ukrainian soldiers and injured four others. Torden denies the allegations.",
      "It marks the first time charges have been brought and heard in a Finnish court over allegations of war crimes in Ukraine.",

      "Torden was arrested at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in July 2023 at the request of the Ukrainian government, which sought to extradite him.",
      "That request was rejected by Finland's Supreme Court over concerns he would not receive a fair trial in Ukraine - but he was still able to be tried in Helsinki as he was accused of crimes under international law.",

      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Vladimir Putin of trying to \"sabotage\" diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire.",
      "In a post on social media, he urged the US to put more pressure on the Russian president, saying only the \"strength of America\" could end the war.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said Putin was \"doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire\".",

      "Peace talks are in parallel universe, say Ukraine front-line troops",
      "Is Putin ready for a ceasefire or playing for time?",
      "He raised the Kursk border region, where Russian forces are retaking territory occupied by Ukraine six months ago. He accused Ukrainian forces of \"heinous crimes against civilians\" \u2013 something Kyiv denies - and asked whether they should walk free or surrender.",
      "He asked about whether Ukraine would use a ceasefire to mobilise, retrain and resupply its troops, without suggesting his forces might do the same.",
      "And Putin raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east. \"Who will be able to determine who violated the potential ceasefire agreement over a distance of 2,000 km and where exactly?\" he asked. \"Who will be held responsible for violating the ceasefire?\"",
      "At a meeting with journalists on Friday, Zelensky addressed these issues directly, especially the questions about verification. He said Ukraine was more than able to verify a ceasefire in the air and the sea. But he said the surveillance and intelligence capabilities of American and European aircraft and satellites would be needed to monitor the front line.",
      "Ukraine believes Putin's conditions of detail can be addressed. Much harder to deal with are Putin's objections of principle. He said any deal should \"proceed from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis\". By that, he means his objections to the expansion of the Nato military alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign independent state.",
      "There is very little chance of that being addressed in any immediate interim ceasefire. Not for nothing did G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada emphasise Ukraine's territorial integrity \"and its right to exist and its freedom, sovereignty and independence\".",
      "This is why Zelensky said \"Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down\".",
      "So what could happen now? Well the ball is in America's court. President Trump could choose to step up pressure on Russia as Ukraine is demanding. He could impose more sanctions on Russia - and countries buying its cheap oil and gas. He could also give more military and intelligence support to Ukraine. Or alternatively Trump could offer Russia more concessions to get a deal over the line, a possibility that worries some here in Kyiv. Much of the contact between the US and Russia has been held in secret compared to the very public diplomatic pressure imposed on Ukraine.",
      "That is why Zelensky is calling out Russia's delaying tactics and urging the West to put more pressure on Putin. He may also be enjoying seeing Russia in the spotlight, having been the butt of American diplomatic efforts for more than a month since Trump and Putin had their first telephone call.",
      "The bottom line is that Trump has driven a diplomatic bulldozer through many international issues since his inauguration, including the war in Ukraine.",
      "But now he has come up against the walls of the Kremlin and they may be harder to get through.",
      "Trump wants a fast end to the fighting. Putin wants a \"painstaking\" discussion about details and principles. Two incompatible imperatives held by two stubborn leaders used to getting their way. Who will blink first? The prospects of a ceasefire are by no means certain, for all the American expressions of \"cautious optimism\".",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 01:26:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

    "story": [
      "Freddy Mukuza's final moments were witnessed by a friend, who stood helpless, 50m (160 ft) away.",
      "When he heard that Freddy had been shot - by M23 rebels he was told - he and others rushed to the scene in Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "\"When we arrived, we found Freddy still breathing, and wanted to take him away, but the M23 did not allow us,\" says the friend, who we are calling Justin.",
      "\"When we insisted, they fired bullets into the ground as if to say: 'If you dare cross this perimeter, we will kill you as well.'\"",
      "So they had to keep their distance, as Freddy, 31, took his last breath. Only then did the M23 allow them to approach and take away his body.",
      "Shortly before the killing, three pick-up trucks full of rebel fighters had come to Freddy's neighbourhood - Kasika.",
      "It was around 15:00 on Saturday 22 February - almost a month after the rebel group had captured Goma in a rapid advance through the east of the country.",
      "Within an hour or so, between 17 and 22 people had been killed, mostly young men, according to our sources.",
      "We have gathered detailed accounts from residents, who cannot be identified, for their own protection.",
      "We asked the M23 for a response to the allegation that they carried out a mass killing in the neighbourhood. They did not reply.",
      "O\ufb03cials in Kasika have not released a death toll, and there is little or no prospect of an independent criminal investigation into what residents are calling a massacre.",
      "But locals insist the M23 is the only armed group which can operate freely, and shoot to kill in broad daylight in Goma.",
      "Since taking the city at the end of January, the rebels have been in complete control. During the 18 days we spent on the ground, their authority was absolute.",
      "They have been accused in the past of carrying out atrocities in other areas.",
      "The heavily armed rebels do not act alone. They are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, according to the UN and the US. Rwanda denies this, though it no longer denies having its own troops in DR Congo, saying they are there in self-defence.",
      "It is believed the M23 targeted Kasika because of a former Congolese army base in the area.",
      "The Katindo camp is now closed but some of the soldiers and their families remain in the district.",
      "\"Not all the soldiers were able to run away,\" a local resident explains. \"Some threw away their guns and stayed about the neighbourhood.\"",
      "But Freddy Mukuza was a civilian - a married father of two, struggling to get by. When hard times came, he earned a living by taking passengers on his motorbike.",
      "He was also an activist and songwriter who rapped about the many problems in his homeland - a country rich in minerals whose people are amongst the poorest in the world.",
      "DR Congo is known as a place of corruption and instability - and of conflict, stretching back 30 years. That is if the country and its suffering are remembered at all.",
      "Sexual violence is endemic. The government is weak, at best.",
      "There was plenty for Freddy to rap about.",
      "One of his songs is called Au Secours (Help in French), the lyrics full of questions that have gone unanswered:",
      "\"Who will come to the aid of these people? Who will come to the aid of these raped women? Who will come to the aid of these unemployed men?... The people are in danger, they don't have enough to eat. They [the authorities] buy jeeps.\"",
      "On the day of his death, Freddy was moving to a new rented home in Kasika. His brother-in-law was helping him put a tarpaulin over the roof.",
      "His sister-in-law was there too, getting the house ready for Freddy's family. When they heard the shooting, they were inside and rushed to shut the door, but they were seen by the M23.",
      "The rebels shot and killed Freddy's two in-laws, according to his friend Justin.",
      "Since then, Justin has barely left home, not even to earn money. His family is surviving on vegetables and fruit. Tea is now a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "He has stopped his children going to school, for fear they might be taken from their classrooms by the M23 and forcibly recruited.",
      "\"We believe it is more important that they stay alive,\" he says.",
      "His world has shrunk to his own four walls. There is the constant nagging fear that the rebels could return hunting for young men.",
      "Just the sight of one of their pick-up trucks in the street sends locals running, he says.",
      "These days it is rare to find a group of young people talking together, he tells us, and neighbours no long share gripes about the authorities as they did before the rebel takeover.",
      "\"Before, there was bad governance, but we were free,\" he says. \"There was embezzlement. There was mismanagement and we spoke out about that. We had the chance to go to court. Today, there is bad governance, but we live in terror and silence.\"",
      "Justin is speaking to us because he wants Freddy Mukuza to be remembered, and he wants the outside world to know about life and death under the M23.",

      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "Since the killings, Kasika has been shrouded in fear. Local journalists have not reported the story.",
      "But a shaky video was posted on social media the next day, 23 February, which appears to show some of the victims: 10 bodies are visible - dumped in a tangled heap, in an unfinished building. It is unclear if any of the dead were soldiers.",
      "None are in uniform and there is no sign of any weapons.",
      "In the background there are screams and shouts. One woman repeats over and over: \"There are 10 of them,\" as she moves from body to body.",
      "\"They are going to finish us all,\" she says. \"They killed all these young people.  Isn't that Junior? I think it is him. He is a house builder.\"",
      "Without the video, news of the killings might not have spread beyond the neighbourhood.",
      "But the footage had the power to shock, even by the violent standards of DR Congo.",
      "Our sources say it is authentic. One confirmed that the location shown is in Kasika.",
      "He visited the place after the bodies were moved. And he recognised one of those seen crying in the video, from around the neighbourhood.",
      "Two of our sources say the youngest to die in Kasika was a boy aged 13-14. The teenager was inside his own home, hiding behind his sisters.",
      "\"The M23 said: 'If this boy does not come with us, we will kill all of you,'\" one man told us.",

      "Also killed - another street vendor, in his twenties.",
      "When the shooting started, he was sitting in his usual spot - on the pavement outside his own front door, selling airtime for mobile phones and home-made doughnuts.",
      "He was overheard pleading with the rebels: \"I'm not a soldier.",
      "\"I just sell airtime. Look, these are my things - my airtime and my basket of doughnuts.\"",
      "Then he ran. One of his friends takes up the story. We are calling him John.",
      "\"I was in the house, and I heard gunfire,\" John tells us. \"People were saying: 'They are taking young people by force.' I saw people running, including my friend, so I ran with them.",
      "\"When we reached the main road, there was shooting, and I heard gunfire behind me and somebody fell.\"",
      "That was the doughnut seller.",
      "Despite his age, he was still in secondary school, in his final year. He was a keen student who had a late start because his family could not afford to educate him.",
      "But John says: \"Like all young people, he had a dream.\" In his case, it was to be an engineer.",
      "John says the rebels did not care who they killed.",
      "\"There was no inquiry before shooting,\" he tells us. \"They just shot at everyone who was present, and at people who ran away, in two different directions.\"",
      "When the M23 captured Goma, they announced they had no prisons. John says no further explanation was needed: \"That meant whoever is presumed to be a government soldier, or a thief, or whoever makes a mistake, will be killed - immediately.\"",
      "Weeks on, few have dared to speak out. \"No-one wants to be next,\" John says.",
      "Bereaved families have held small hasty burials - without the usual mourning at home.",
      "\"The rebels didn't want any funerals,\" says one resident, who we are calling Deborah. \"They didn't even want people to cry. We thought they were coming to bring peace, but instead they came to exterminate us. They took everyone they found on the street.\"",
      "As the men were being rounded up, she tried to step outside. The rebels ordered her back in, at gunpoint.",
      "Denis Baeni was on his way home when the rebels arrived in Kasika. He dashed into a small shop to hide with a few others, our sources say.",
      "The primary school teacher got his ID card out of a pocket. He may have thought that would save him, by proving he was a civilian.",
      "A neighbour - with knowledge of the events - tells us what happened. We are calling her Rebecca.",
      "\"They heard a voice from outside asking: 'Are there any soldiers?'\" Rebecca says. \"They said no but the M23 took them out of the shop.\"",
      "The men were told to walk a short distance to a half-built house where they were \"assembled for execution\".",
      "\"There was so much gunfire,\" she says. \"It was so close. There were 21 people killed all at once from our neighbourhood. Many were just passing by.\"",
      "Rebecca insists they were all civilians. \"Not one was a soldier,\" she says.",
      "Denis leaves behind two children, who he was raising alone.",
      "Death is not the only danger here. Locals also face the risk of being recruited to fight - willingly or otherwise.",
      "\"Nowadays men have to be home by 17:30,\" says Rebecca. \"By 18:00 it's dark, and they can take you very easily.\"",
      "As families in Kasika are forced to stifle their grief, the M23 are continuing their sweep through eastern DR Congo.",
      "After Goma, they took control of the city of Bukavu in mid-February. They have threatened to go all the way to the capital, Kinshasa, 1,600km (almost 1,000 miles) away.",
      "They claim they are revolutionaries battling a failed state, and defending the rights of minority Tutsis.",
      "Human rights groups paint a very different picture.",
      "They have accused the armed group of a catalogue of abuses since its foundation in 2012 - including systematic shelling of civilian areas, gang rape and \"summary executions\".  The allegations have been documented in a series of reports.",

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",

      "In her new memoir, \"Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,\" Mulvaney shares journal entries documenting the first year of her gender transition.",
      "\"I think of the book as like a quarter life crisis. But at the end of the day, I think it has a lot more heart than social media ever can have,\" Mulvaney said.",
      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",
      "She first came out as gay at 14, but it took another decade to embrace her identity as a trans woman.",
      "\"I settled into the identity as gay because that was all I saw around me,\" she explained.",
      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "The veteran actor explained that the dual role, where he portrays both Frank and Vito in \"The Alto Knights,\" required precise positioning and careful coordination with cameras on dollies moving around the set.",
      "\"It's a technical thing where you have to be in a certain spot,\" De Niro said.",

    "summary": "The Emmy Award-winning comedian and former \"SNL\" writer became a superstar as a stand-up; now, he's sitting down, as host of a Netflix talk show, \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.\"",
    "story": [
      "John Mulaney is a comedy superstar finding the funny in the familiar.\u00a0 At 42, he already has five highly-rated specials to his name \u2026 three primetime Emmys \u2026 and a reputation as one of the best stand-up guys in the game.",
      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before. I've collided with you some other time.' So, it's like these people came in that just, I don't know, make me like the world a lot more.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

    "summary": "Dr. Celine Gounder explains how poor dental care can potentially increasing your risk of developing other health conditions.",
    "story": [
      "In recent years, research has suggested a connection between oral bacteria and Alzheimer's disease, raising concerns for those with poor dental health.",
      "With nearly 700 species of bacteria inhabiting the human mouth, experts say maintaining good oral hygiene could benefit both heart and brain health.",
      "There is growing evidence suggesting good oral health could help prevent Alzheimer's disease. One study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease\u00a0found that people who flossed regularly had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's than those who did not.",
      "However, researchers caution there is still limited research. The observational studies do not prove that flossing directly prevents Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"When you think about it, what is poor gum health, poor dental health? It's really a bacterial infection,\" explained Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor. \"When you have chronic infection, chronic inflammation, we know that chronic inflammation increases your risk for heart disease, for cerebrovascular disease, brain disease. It's really important to control these things.\"",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults 30 years or older have some form of periodontal disease.",
      "In addition to causing inflammation, the bacteria associated with gum disease produce enzymes that can be directly toxic to nerves, Gounder said. They also weaken the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxins and other bacteria to enter the brain.",
      "Research shows that these oral bacteria can increase amyloid in the brain \u2014 a protein plaque connected with Alzheimer's disease.",
      "The mouth-to-brain pathway occurs when bacteria from dental problems enter the bloodstream.",
      "\"When you have gum disease and dental problems, the bacteria in your mouth are getting into the blood, and from the blood, they can travel anywhere, including the heart and the brain,\" Gounder said.",
      "This bacterial spread isn't a new concern. Before antibiotics became available in the 1800s, dental infections commonly led to heart valve infections and heart failure as bacteria spread through the bloodstream.",
      "While water picks and mouthwash offer some benefits, Gounder emphasized they aren't sufficient replacements for flossing.",
      "\"Water picks are better than nothing, but mouthwash is not a substitute ... There is really no replacement for something like flossing,\" she said.",
      "The National Institutes of Health identifies several signs of gum disease, including red, swollen, or bleeding gums; pain while chewing; persistent bad breath; and loose or sensitive teeth.",
      "For prevention, the NIH recommends brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, visiting the dentist twice per year, and avoiding smoking.",
      "The recommendation is to floss once daily, preferably before bed. However, people with gingivitis, receding gums, diabetes or heart disease may benefit from flossing at least twice daily.",

    "summary": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former surgeon and television host, was nominated to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
    "story": [
      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",
      "\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.",

      "As millions of Americans travel for spring break getaways, some may face an invisible danger. Carbon monoxide poisoning could be a risk at hotels or vacation rentals.",
      "You can't see or smell carbon monoxide gas, but it's the leading cause of poisoning deaths in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 400 Americans die each year \"from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning not linked to fires.\"",

      "Experts suggest making sure your hotel room or rental is equipped with at least one carbon monoxide detector.",
      "\"You're going to want one at least on every floor as well as near bedrooms and in the hallways outside bedrooms,\" Malloy said, which is also recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "If the alarm goes off in your home, hotel or vacation rental, experts say to get out of the building immediately.",
      "\"If I'm in my apartment, Airbnb, wherever I'm staying and the alarm goes off, I know that we're getting about 30 parts per million carbon monoxide,\" Malloy said.",
      "Both Airbnb and Vrbo post on their website whether or not they have carbon monoxide alarms installed in units. Even so, the safest move is to pack one of your own when you travel. Consider taking a portable detector so you can walk around your rental unit and test to make sure the air is safe to breathe.",
      "Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "Data shows firefighters responded to more than 4,000 carbon monoxide incidents at hotels, motels and resorts between 1999 and 2020. More than 1,000 people have been hurt and at least two dozen have died, according to the National Fire Incident Reporting System.",

      "A total of 1,274 cases were reported in 2019, according to the CDC, the most reported in the U.S. in decades. Health officials were alarmed at the time about large and ongoing outbreaks, driven mostly by spread in undervaccinated communities in New York.",
      "Before this year, the last U.S. measles death in the CDC's death certificate records was also in 2019. This past February, a child who was hospitalized with measles died in West Texas. This month, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico tested positive for measles after their death, although health officials said the official cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "The U.S. is not the only country seeing an increase in measles cases. A separate record outbreak in Canada has driven up cases across the Americas, prompting the World Health Organization to warn earlier this month that the region's \"elimination status\" was at risk.",

      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",

There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",

      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",

      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",

      "\"It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\" said Fugate, 42. \"And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\"",
      "In February, Fugate received confirmation that her application was received and had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\"And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\" she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\"",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\"I was months away from ending this nightmare,\" she said. \"Now I don't think that's going to happen. I'm kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\"They're dealing with the same thing,\" she said. \"It's scary. It's absolutely scary.\"",

      "Guinness, the Irish beer that has been around since before the American Revolution, is celebrating a renaissance with rapidly rising popularity in the United States.",
      "\"People are finding this beer for the first time, or, in some cases, rediscovering it,\" said Ryan Wagner, Guinness National Ambassador. \"You're not just finding it in Irish pubs. Now it's in sports bars, at the beach, in coolers being taken to tailgates.\"",
      "Part of this resurgence is attributed to social media, where the viral \"Splitting the G\" challenge has celebrities like Ed Sheeran and Niall Horan attempting to take one or two gulps and land the beer line precisely in the gap of the letter \"G\" in the logo.",
      "For newcomers concerned about Guinness' dark appearance, Wagner offered reassurance.",
      "\"The first thing we would tell someone is don't let the color scare you away. It's light in body. It's a little roasty, a little toasty, incredibly drinkable, and something that's built around occasions, bringing people together.\"",
      "The legacy of Guinness",
      "The brewing legacy dates back to 1759 in Dublin. Today, 3.5 million pints are produced daily and shipped worldwide. Devoted fans insist the beer requires a specific \"perfect pour\" technique \u2014 a two-part process that affects both taste and texture.",

    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",

      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods, citing trade imbalances and drug trafficking. But many of his claims exaggerate or misrepresent the facts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

    "summary": "The USDA said it is promoting wiser government spending, but schools say it will make it tougher to serve healthy meals.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "\"USDA can confirm it has provided notice to States, Territories and Tribes that the FY 2025 funding previously announced for the pandemic-era Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and pandemic-era Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program is no longer available and those agreements will be terminated following 60-day notification,\" a spokesperson with the\u00a0agency said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",
      "One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business. Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer.",
      "\"We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester Food Hub,\" Carlson said. \"They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.\"",

      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",

      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued.

      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% on an annual basis, slightly lower than economists had forecast but continuing to signal that price hikes remain elevated despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

      "President Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising they would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and even a global trade war.",
      "The European Union quickly announced it would retaliate with steps that will take effect April 1.",
      "\"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros ($28 billion),\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. \"We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",
      "It also reported that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the Trump move \"entirely unjustified ... and against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship,\" but he ruled out tit-for-tat duties.",
      "\"Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers,\" Albanese told reporters.",
      "Canada also plans to announce\u00a0nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum levies, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Lutnick defends Trump economic policies",

The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",
      "The ongoing rise in food prices is posing a challenge to some U.S. households, particularly among lower-income consumers who spend a greater share of their income on groceries than higher-earning Americans, according to a new Bank of America Institute analysis of consumer spending.",
      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "But while egg prices could see some relief in Wednesday's inflation report, food prices are still on the rise, economists say. On a month-over-month basis, food costs likely rose 0.3%, Vanguard said on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans themselves are bracing for higher grocery costs, according to the March 10 release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",

      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

The funding bill now heads to President Trump's desk for his signature.",
      "The vote came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against the partisan measure to keep the government funded through September. But instead he reluctantly pledged on Thursday to advance it, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel it to passage. He warned of the larger threat a shutdown would pose for the American people.",

      "After his remarks Thursday night, Schumer wouldn't say whether other Democrats would join him in voting to advance the measure, telling reporters that \"each is making his or her own decision.\" But Schumer's support for the continuing resolution gave other Democrats political cover to do the same, diminishing the threat of a shutdown.",
      "Ultimately, Schumer was joined in voting to advance the measure by Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to oppose advancing the measure and he voted against it on final passage. Shaheen and King voted in favor of final passage.",
      "On Tuesday, the House passed the measure, which increases defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. Republicans have praised additional funding in the measure for programs like nutrition assistance for women, infants and children, while Democrats have railed against cuts to medical research and housing programs \u2014 and more than $1 billion in cuts to D.C.'s local government spending. The Senate also voted to reverse the cuts following the vote to keep the government funded, but the measure still must be taken up by the House.",
      "Just one House Democrat joined the Republican majority in support of the measure. And while the House requires only a simple majority, a 60-vote threshold is required to invoke cloture and advance most measures in the Senate, meaning the support of Democrats was needed to get the measure to ultimately pass.",
      "Still, the party had been split on how to proceed. Democrats widely oppose the House-passed measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, and they warn that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts.",
      "Democrats had been pushing for a 30-day continuing resolution that had little chance of earning enough support for passage. And with the House having already left town, the option would almost certainly have resulted in a funding lapse. But some progressives suggested that the shorter option was more favorable, letting the onus for a government shutdown fall on Republicans, arguing that it would have further illuminated the chaos that has ensued in the federal bureaucracy and beyond under the Trump administration and DOGE.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez told reporters Thursday night that Schumer's move to back the continuing resolution \u2014 known as a CR \u2014 was a \"huge slap in the face,\" adding that there is a \"wide sense of betrayal\" among the party.",
      "\"What voting for the CR does is that it codifies the chaos and the reckless cuts that Elon Musk has been pursuing,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The robbing of our federal government in order to finance tax cuts for billionaires, is what is happening, and that is what Senate Democrats will be empowering if they vote for the CR.\"",
      "Schumer told reporters following his floor remarks that Democrats should keep the attention on their message \u2014 that Republicans are hurting the middle class \u2014 rather than on what the Trump administration could pursue during a shutdown. Schumer said the message is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "The president congratulated Schumer Friday morning for \"doing the right thing,\" saying in a post on Truth Social that it took \"courage.\"",
      "The minority leader first informed Senate Democrats that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure during a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CBS News. As the meeting let out, frustrations appeared high among Senate Democrats, and a number of them \u2014 including many who hail from battleground states \u2014 quickly released statements on social media announcing they would vote \"no\" on the House-passed continuing resolution.",
      "Besides Schumer, only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, had pledged to support the continuing resolution heading into the day on Friday. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada became the third Democrat to pledge to support the measure to avert a shutdown ahead of the vote.",
      "Democrats continued to rail against their options on Friday morning. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator who had been engaged in bipartisan talks to fund the government, said the choice between a shutdown and letting the GOP bill pass \"has always been a false choice.\" She accused Republicans of pulling out of bipartisan negotiations and sending \"a deeply partisan bill here to the Senate today.\"",
      "\"Democrats did not have an ounce of input into writing this bill,\" Murray said. \"In my time in Congress, never, ever has one party written partisan full-year appropriations bills for all of government and expected the other party to go along without any input.\"",
      "Murray said the Senate could still pass the short-term funding measure that she introduced earlier this week, saying House Republicans could get on a plane to come back and vote.",
      "Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders returned to the Capitol Friday to express their opposition to the continuing resolution, calling this an \"unprecedented situation and an unprecedented disaster\" for the American people.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a rambling campaign-style speech at the Justice Department on Friday to lay out his vision for the department, in which he aired his grievances over the federal investigations into him and vowed retribution against his political foes.",
      "Mr. Trump referred to a \"corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government\" who he said had \"obliterated\" trust and goodwill over generations, but promised \"those days are over\" and are \"never coming back.\" Opening his remarks, he said the Justice Department is starting a \"proud new chapter in the chronicles of American justice.\"",
      "\"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals,\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"And we're restoring fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been a regular critic of the Justice Department for years, even before special counsel Jack Smith indicted him in two criminal cases after he left office. The president praised one of the judges in those cases during his remarks. Mr. Trump said federal judge Aileen Cannon, who he appointed during his first term and who ultimately dismissed the classified documents case against him, as \"the absolute model of what a judge should be.\"",
      "In January, about a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for\u00a0Smith\u00a0on the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump were fired. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions by email after department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Earlier this month, the president moved to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the\u00a02016 presidential campaign\u00a0into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia. Mr. Trump's order also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by the firm's attorneys \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "His appearance at the department was notable given that no president has appeared there in a decade. In 2015, President Barack Obama made the last known public appearance by a sitting U.S. president at the Justice Department, when he paid tribute to departing attorney general Eric Holder. Before that, President George W. Bush in 2001 visited the department in order to formally change the name of the building to honor Robert F. Kennedy, who served as attorney general under the administration of his brother, President John F. Kennedy.",
      "The Justice Department, in order to protect its independence and integrity in law enforcement decisions, traditionally doesn't advise the White House about pending or possible criminal or civil investigations or cases, unless it's important to the president's duties, according to the Justice Manual.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke of his vision for Washington as a capital that is \"the talk of the world,\" then trailed off about men's college basketball coach Bobby Knight, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war and the 2020 election. He rounded out his lengthy remarks by putting drug cartels on notice and acknowledging family members of Americans who died from fentanyl.",
      "The president was introduced by Attorney General Pam Bondi, and FBI Director Kash Patel was also in attendance.",
      "Ahead of the president's remarks, some Democrats criticized Mr. Trump and alleged he has broken the law since he took office.",
      "\"President Trump began breaking the law on day one of his term, and immediately pardoned hundreds of violent criminals upon taking office,\" said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat. \"The Trump administration is breaking the law and undermining the Constitution every day by illegally stealing funds for the programs that help American families and businesses, firing career civil servants without cause, and dismantling agencies created by acts of Congress.\"",
      "\"Restoring law and order starts with respecting the Rule of Law itself and the sacredness of our Constitution,\" Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York said in a statement. \"This administration has failed to do so since day one.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",
      "\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.",

      "The preliminary results\u00a0show\u00a0the index fell to 57.9, compared with 64.7 a month ago, according to the Friday report. The reading marks the lowest level since November of 2022, researchers that compile the data said. Economists had expected consumer confidence to hold relatively steady, according to financial-data company FactSet.",
      "The results are \"a reflection of the Great Uncertainty around the economic policies put forward by the Trump administration,\" commented Carl Weinberg at High Frequency Economics. \"Consumer spending may become restrained by caution until the Trump economic agenda becomes clear.\"",
      "The White House's \"policy uncertainty has tanked consumer sentiment to its lowest level since inflation peaked more than two years ago, sent the stock market into correction territory and led forecasters to materially raise recession probabilities,\" commented Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council.",
      "More Americans expressing concern",
      "Consumers anticipate inflation climbing at an annual rate of 4.9% during the next year, their highest expectations since 2022. While inflation abated slightly in February, more Americans are expressing concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's ongoing trade wars, as tariffs are import taxes paid by companies such as Walmart and Target that are often passed onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "\"The klaxon of layoff headlines, a falling stock market and tariff fears were a big blow to consumer confidence in early March,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email. \"The pullback in confidence is becoming a real threat to consumer spending which, as is often repeated, accounts for two thirds of U.S. economic activity.\"",
      "Consumers are also now expecting elevated inflation to be a long-term issue, saying they expect prices will increase at an annual clip of 3.9% during the next five to 10 years, the biggest month-over-month jump since 1993, the survey found. That's far higher than the Federal Reserve's inflation goal of driving the annual rate down to 2%.",

    "summary": "As Congress mulls significant cuts to Medicaid, Native American tribes are bracing for potentially devastating financial fallout.",
    "story": [
      "As Congress mulls potentially massive cuts to federal Medicaid funding, health centers that serve Native American communities, such as the Oneida Community Health Center near Green Bay, Wisconsin, are bracing for catastrophe.",
      "That's because more than 40% of the about 15,000 patients the center serves are enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would be detrimental to those patients and the facility, said Debra Danforth, the director of the Oneida Comprehensive Health Division and a citizen of the Oneida Nation.",
      "\"It would be a tremendous hit,\" she said.",
      "The facility provides a range of services to most of the Oneida Nation's 17,000 people, including ambulatory care, internal medicine, family practice, and obstetrics. The tribe is one of two in Wisconsin that have an \"open-door policy,\" Danforth said, which means that the facility is open to members of any federally recognized tribe.",
      "But Danforth and many other tribal health officials say Medicaid cuts would cause service reductions at health facilities that serve Native Americans.",
      "Indian Country has a unique relationship to Medicaid, because the program helps tribes cover chronic funding shortfalls from the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans.",
      "Medicaid has accounted for about two-thirds of third-party revenue for tribal health providers, creating financial stability and helping facilities pay operational costs. More than a million Native Americans enrolled in Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program also rely on the insurance to pay for care outside of tribal health facilities without going into significant medical debt. Tribal leaders are calling on Congress to exempt tribes from cuts and are preparing to fight to preserve their access.",
      "\"Medicaid is one of the ways in which the federal government meets its trust and treaty obligations to provide health care to us,\" said Liz Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, a nonprofit policy advocacy organization for 33 tribes spanning from Texas to Maine. Malerba is a citizen of the Mohegan Tribe.",
      "\"So we view any disruption or cut to Medicaid as an abrogation of that responsibility,\" she said.",
      "Tribes face an arduous task in providing care to a population that experiences severe health disparities, a high incidence of chronic illness, and, at least in western states, a life expectancy of 64 years \u2014 the lowest of any demographic group in the U.S. Yet, in recent years, some tribes have expanded access to care for their communities by adding health services and providers, enabled in part by Medicaid reimbursements.",
      "During the last two fiscal years, five urban Indian organizations in Montana saw funding growth of nearly $3 million, said Lisa James, director of development for the Montana Consortium for Urban Indian Health, during a webinar in February organized by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families and the National Council of Urban Indian Health.",
      "The increased revenue was \"instrumental,\" James said, allowing clinics in the state to add services that previously had not been available unless referred out for, including behavioral health services. Clinics were also able to expand operating hours and staffing.",
      "Montana's five urban Indian clinics, in Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls, and Billings, serve 30,000 people, including some who are not Native American or enrolled in a tribe. The clinics provide a wide range of services, including primary care, dental care, disease prevention, health education, and substance use prevention.",
      "James said Medicaid cuts would require Montana's urban Indian health organizations to cut services and limit their ability to address health disparities.",
      "American Indian and Alaska Native people under age 65 are more likely to be uninsured than White people under 65, but 30% rely on Medicaid compared with 15% of their White counterparts, according to KFF data for 2017 to 2021. More than 40% of American Indian and Alaska Native children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, which provides health insurance to kids whose families are not eligible for Medicaid. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "A Georgetown Center for Children and Families report from January found the share of residents enrolled in Medicaid was higher in counties with a significant Native American presence. The proportion on Medicaid in small-town or rural counties that are mostly within tribal statistical areas, tribal subdivisions, reservations, and other Native-designated lands was 28.7%, compared with 22.7% in other small-town or rural counties. About 50% of children in those Native areas were enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "The federal government has already exempted tribes from some of President Trump's executive orders. In late February, Department of Health and Human Services acting general counsel Sean Keveney clarified that tribal health programs would not be affected by an executive order that diversity, equity, and inclusion government programs be terminated, but that the Indian Health Service is expected to discontinue diversity and inclusion hiring efforts established under an Obama-era rule.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also rescinded the layoffs of more than 900 IHS employees in February just hours after they'd received termination notices. During Kennedy's Senate confirmation hearings, he said he would appoint a Native American as an assistant HHS secretary. The National Indian Health Board, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for tribes, in December endorsed elevating the director of the Indian Health Service to assistant secretary of HHS.",
      "Jessica Schubel, a senior health care official in former President Joe Biden's White House, said exemptions won't be enough.",
      "\"Just because Native Americans are exempt doesn't mean that they won't feel the impact of cuts that are made throughout the rest of the program,\" she said.",
      "State leaders are also calling for federal Medicaid spending to be spared because cuts to the program would shift costs onto their budgets. Without sustained federal funding, which can cover more than 70% of costs, state lawmakers face decisions such as whether to change eligibility requirements to slim Medicaid rolls, which could cause some Native Americans to lose their health coverage.",
      "Tribal leaders noted that state governments do not have the same responsibility to them as the federal government, yet they face large variations in how they interact with Medicaid depending on their state programs.",
      "Mr. Trump has made seemingly conflicting statements about Medicaid cuts, saying in an interview on Fox News in February that Medicaid and Medicare wouldn't be touched. In a social media post the same week, Mr. Trump expressed strong support for a House budget resolution that would likely require Medicaid cuts.",
      "The budget proposal, which the House approved in late February, requires lawmakers to cut spending to offset tax breaks. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees spending on Medicaid and Medicare, is instructed to slash $880 billion over the next decade. The possibility of cuts to the program that, together with CHIP, provides insurance to 79 million people has drawn opposition from national and state organizations.",
      "The federal government reimburses IHS and tribal health facilities 100% of billed costs for American Indian and Alaska Native patients, shielding state budgets from the costs.",
      "Because Medicaid is already a stopgap fix for Native American health programs, tribal leaders said it won't be a matter of replacing the money but operating with less.",
      "\"When you're talking about somewhere between 30% to 60% of a facility's budget is made up by Medicaid dollars, that's a very difficult hole to try and backfill,\" said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.",
      "Congress isn't required to consult tribes during the budget process, Davis added. Only after changes are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state agencies are tribes able to engage with them on implementation.",
      "The amount the federal government spends funding the Native American health system is a much smaller portion of its budget than Medicaid. The IHS projected billing Medicaid about $1.3 billion this fiscal year, which represents less than half of 1% of overall federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"We are saving more lives,\" Malerba said of the additional services Medicaid covers in tribal health care. \"It brings us closer to a level of 21st century care that we should all have access to but don't always.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 12:19:20 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent changes to student loans have caused confusion and uncertainty around recertification process for borrowers enrolled in repayment plans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers.",
      "In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans.",
      "\"This especially hurts anyone who's lost their jobs, including federal workers,\" said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \"A few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\"",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",
      "\"It's been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Guidance for those with student loans",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \"get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\"Try saying something like, 'I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I'm entitled to under the law,'\" Ba\u00f1ez said. \"'Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.'\"",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower's financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\"You can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\" she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\"It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\" said Fugate, 42. \"And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\"",
      "In February, Fugate received confirmation that her application was received and had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\"And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\" she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\"",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\"I was months away from ending this nightmare,\" she said. \"Now I don't think that's going to happen. I'm kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\"They're dealing with the same thing,\" she said. \"It's scary. It's absolutely scary.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said he hopes dialogue can resolve the trade war between the U.S. and the European Union after President Trump Thursday threatened to impose 200% retaliatory tariffs on European wines and alcohols.",
      "The tariffs were a response to the European Union's counter-tariffs against Mr. Trump's initial steel and aluminum hikes.",
      "\"I think it's a lot of uncertainty at the moment,\" Martin said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"Overall, tariffs are damaging to trade, damaging to businesses, but also damaging to consumers, because they will lead to an increase in prices for consumers. I don't think that's good, either way. So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"",
      "Martin said that Mr. Trump was \"very conscious of the goods surplus that Ireland has, particularly through the pharmaceutical issue.\"",
      "\"But if you put services into the mix, of course Ireland is in deficit,\" he said.",
      "Martin described the U.S. and Ireland's economic relationship as a \"two-way street\" and touted his country's investment in the U.S., including over 700 Irish companies that he said were responsible for the creation of more than 200,000 jobs in the U.S. Martin also highlighted that Irish airline, Ryanair, had recently placed an order for over 400 Boeing aircraft.",
      "When added with another Irish company AerCap's purchase of 150 Boeing aircraft last year, Irish-owned companies were \"the largest purchaser of Boeing aircraft outside the United States,\" he said.",
      "\"In an absolute worst-case scenario, say, a 25% increase across the board on tariffs, a tit-for-tat from both sides \u2014 a Boeing 787, the price will go up by $40 million,\" AerCap's CEO Aengus Kelly said Wednesday on CNBC. \"No one's going to want to pay that.\"",
      "Kelly said European companies would likely buy aircraft manufactured by Airbus, which is a European company, if Mr. Trump's tariffs are applied.",
      "Asked about his meetings with the president Wednesday at the White House, Martin described them as \"positive meetings\" that celebrated the \"historic ties between the two countries.\" He called Mr. Trump a \"gracious host\" who has an \"affection for Ireland.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-cuts-hundreds-federal-offices-start-empty-summer/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:35:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Bredar came late Thursday in a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia against multiple federal agencies alleging the mass firings are illegal.",
      "\"In this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice,\" Bredar wrote. \"It claims it wasn't required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for 'performance' or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively.\"",
      "The states contend the Trump administration blindsided them by ignoring laws set out for large-scale layoffs, which already are having an impact on state governments as they try to help the suddenly jobless. At least 24,000 probationary employees have been terminated since President Trump took office, the lawsuit alleges, though efforts by the judge to get an estimate from a government attorney at a hearing Wednesday were unsuccessful.",
      "The Trump administration argues that the states have no right to try and influence the federal government's relationship with its own workers. Mr. Trump has said he's targeting fraud, waste and abuse in a bloated federal government.",
      "In his temporary restraining order, Bredar issued a 14-day stay on what he called \"illegal\" reductions in force. His order, however, did not apply to firings at the Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO is 'an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief,'...there is insufficient basis in the record for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies,\" Bredar wrote.",
      "Earlier Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco also ordered the Trump's administration to rehire thousands, if not tens of thousands, of probationary workers let go in mass firings across multiple agencies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup said that the terminations were directed by the Office of Personnel Management and its acting director, Charles Ezell, who lacked the authority to do so.",
      "The administration immediately filed an appeal of the injunction with the Ninth Circuit Court. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier Thursday cast the ruling as an attempt to encroach on executive power to hire and fire employees.",
      "\"The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Alsup's order tells the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, the Interior and the Treasury to immediately offer job reinstatement to employees terminated on or about Feb. 13 and 14. He also directed the departments to report back within seven days with a list of probationary employees and an explanation of how the agencies complied with his order as to each person.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed in January to review \"in a gender-neutral way\" readiness standards for troops.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of military standards, including physical fitness, body composition and grooming. It's a review Hegseth promised during his confirmation hearing when questioned about his statements he's made that military standards have eroded.",
      "\"That will be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon \u2014 is reviewing that in a gender-neutral way \u2014 the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy is front and center,\" Hegseth said in January.",
      "The Pentagon released a memo Wednesday night from Hegseth that directs the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness to review the existing standards set by the military departments.",
      "\"We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world's most lethal and effective fighting force,\" Hegseth said. \"Our adversaries are not growing weaker, and our tasks are not growing less challenging.\"",
      "The memo directs the review to examine the standards and how they have changed since Jan. 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Defense Department announced it would open up all combat roles to women.",
      "Hegseth has previously opposed that policy decision, saying in a podcast interview shortly before he was tapped as defense secretary, \"We should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth walked that view back somewhat during his confirmation hearing, promising that women would have access to combat roles if the standards remain high and \"have not been eroded.\"",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, told CBS News in an interview there are separate requirements for men and women, as well as for different ages, to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test that every recruit has to pass. To qualify for special forces, however, the standards are gender-neutral.",
      "\"Those standards are uniform across the genders,\" Kuzminski said, \"which is why we have only seen very small numbers of women going into special operations.\"",
      "For example, as of early January, according to data provided by the Army, there have been 156 female graduates of the notoriously grueling Ranger Course, with 381 women attending the course since it was first made available to women in 2015, for a graduation rate of approximately 41%.",
      "The Ranger Course requires all candidates to swim 15 meters in full uniform, run five miles in under 40 minutes and march 12 miles with a 35-lb. ruck, according to\u00a0the Army.",
      "\"The standards have not been lowered, and each Ranger Course graduate meets the same training standards,\" an Army official told CBS News.",
      "The Pentagon's review could lead to a change in the Army Combat Fitness test, the generic test, so that the requirements are the same for men and women.",
      "Currently, the Army Combat Fitness test is scored based on different requirements for men and women, depending on age. For instance, a man who's 17 to 21 years of age must at a minimum be able to run two miles in 22 minutes, while a woman would need to run the same distance in 23:22. The minimum requirement for hand-release push-ups \u2014 which involve lifting your hands off the ground at the bottom of the push-up \u2014 is the same for men and women of any age: 10.",
      "Facing a recruiting crisis, services in recent years have offered adjustments on drug and tattoo policies and provided enlistment bonuses to attract potential service members, while still maintaining physical and educational standards. The Army also launched pre-enlistment boot camps to help potential candidates get into shape before going into basic training.",
      "Hegseth said during his confirmation hearing that while writing his book \"War on Warriors,\" he spoke to service members who told him that \"in ways direct, indirect, overt and subtle\" standards have changed, but Hegseth didn't provide senators with concrete examples.",
      "Kuzminski also said the defense secretary's review could include revisiting grooming standards, like the Army allowing women to\u00a0wear ponytails or the Navy permitting some men to grow\u00a0facial hair, due to a medical condition exacerbated by shaving.",
      "\"They seem like little things, but they were also tied to a broader initiative during the Biden administration to ensure that there weren't any standards that were disproportionately affecting minorities,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Kuzminski added that changing those back may have some impact on recruiting or retention, but \"it's not something that's going to break the force because the objective of every person in uniform is professionalism, and they will follow through the standard, whatever the standard is.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to limit for now the scope of three lower court orders that broadly blocked enforcement of his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Trump administration asked the high court for emergency relief in three separate requests, which arise out of cases brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In all three disputes, U.S. district court judges issued orders blocking nationwide enforcement of Mr. Trump's executive order, which was issued his first day in office.",
      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris is now asking the high court to limit the sweep of those orders to cover only those individuals who are directly involved in the cases.",
      "\"These cases \u2014 which involve challenges to the president's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship \u2014 raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" she wrote in the requests. \"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purpor[t] to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"",
      "Trump's birthright citizenship order",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship on his first day in office, part of a broad, long-promised crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The order denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.",
      "The president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Four U.S. district judges \u2014 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington \u2014 issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties \u2014 which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals \u2014 while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.",
      "In its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief \u2014 which extends nationwide \u2014 and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.",
      "\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"",
      "She noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"",
      "\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.",
      "On the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Even several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country.

      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Weldon would have been the first CDC director nominee to face Senate confirmation, after a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous picks to head the Atlanta-based public health agency were able to assume their posts without the Senate's votes.",

      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to cite the 18th-century statute to order the swift detention and deportation of suspected members of the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with prison origins that his administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",
      "\"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",

    "summary": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said signs indicated a Mount Spurr eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world's busiest cargo hubs.",

    "story": [
      "A new report on the state of birds in the United States has an urgent warning: bird populations across nearly every habitat are declining, with about one-third of U.S. bird species in critical need of conservation action.",
      "A total of 229 out of 718 bird species in the U.S. are now classified as high or moderate conservation concerns, according to the 2025 State of the Birds report, which was produced by a consortium of scientific and conservation organizations led by the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov took off from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:03 p.m. EDT, putting on a spectacular show as the rocket climbed away from the Kennedy Space Center atop a long jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Ten minutes after liftoff \u2014 and a dramatic first stage landing back at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station \u2014 the Crew Dragon capsule was released from the rocket's upper stage to fly on its own.",
      "As it moved away, a camera on the Falcon 9's second stage showed what a source described as insulation from the Falcon 9's second stage. While unusual, the Crew Dragon was reported to be in good shape and ready to chase down the space station.",
      "Given an on-time liftoff, the Crew Dragon will carry out an autonomous rendezvous with the space station, catching up with the lab Saturday night and moving in for docking at the space station's forward port at 11:30 p.m.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov were launched aboard the Crew 9 Dragon in\u00a0September. Two NASA astronauts who originally planned to be on that flight were bumped from the mission to free up two seats for Wilmore and Williams. They became part of Crew 9 and worked with Hague and Gorbunov for the duration of their six-month mission.",
      "The Crew 9 fliers plan to spend two days familiarizing their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation before boarding their own Crew Dragon, the same one that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, for the trip home.",
      "The flight plan calls for undocking Tuesday, setting the stage for re-entry and splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast next weekend. By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of their mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",

      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",

The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",

      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",

Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed.

      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate on Friday passed a Republican-led stopgap measure to keep the government funded ahead of a midnight deadline.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a Republican-led stopgap measure to keep the government funded ahead of a midnight deadline Friday, following days of consternation from Senate Democrats over an uncomfortable choice \u2014 to allow the GOP bill to pass or let the government shut down.",
      "The Senate passed the bill in a 54 to 46 vote, with one Republican opposing it and two Democrats supporting it after 10 Democrats provided the votes earlier Friday to advance the measure through a key procedural hurdle. The funding bill now heads to President Trump's desk for his signature.",
      "The vote came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against the partisan measure to keep the government funded through September. But instead he reluctantly pledged on Thursday to advance it, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel it to passage. He warned of the larger threat a shutdown would pose for the American people.",
      "\"For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option,\" the New York Democrat said, calling the bill \"deeply partisan\" and urging that \"it doesn't address far too many of this country's needs.\" \"But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.\"",
      "After his remarks Thursday night, Schumer wouldn't say whether other Democrats would join him in voting to advance the measure, telling reporters that \"each is making his or her own decision.\" But Schumer's support for the continuing resolution gave other Democrats political cover to do the same, diminishing the threat of a shutdown.",
      "Ultimately, Schumer was joined in voting to advance the measure by Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to oppose advancing the measure and he voted against it on final passage. Shaheen and King voted in favor of final passage.",
      "On Tuesday, the House passed the measure, which increases defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. Republicans have praised additional funding in the measure for programs like nutrition assistance for women, infants and children, while Democrats have railed against cuts to medical research and housing programs \u2014 and more than $1 billion in cuts to D.C.'s local government spending. The Senate also voted to reverse the cuts following the vote to keep the government funded, but the measure still must be taken up by the House.",
      "Just one House Democrat joined the Republican majority in support of the measure. And while the House requires only a simple majority, a 60-vote threshold is required to invoke cloture and advance most measures in the Senate, meaning the support of Democrats was needed to get the measure to ultimately pass.",
      "Still, the party had been split on how to proceed. Democrats widely oppose the House-passed measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, and they warn that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts.",
      "Democrats had been pushing for a 30-day continuing resolution that had little chance of earning enough support for passage. And with the House having already left town, the option would almost certainly have resulted in a funding lapse. But some progressives suggested that the shorter option was more favorable, letting the onus for a government shutdown fall on Republicans, arguing that it would have further illuminated the chaos that has ensued in the federal bureaucracy and beyond under the Trump administration and DOGE.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez told reporters Thursday night that Schumer's move to back the continuing resolution \u2014 known as a CR \u2014 was a \"huge slap in the face,\" adding that there is a \"wide sense of betrayal\" among the party.",
      "\"What voting for the CR does is that it codifies the chaos and the reckless cuts that Elon Musk has been pursuing,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The robbing of our federal government in order to finance tax cuts for billionaires, is what is happening, and that is what Senate Democrats will be empowering if they vote for the CR.\"",
      "Schumer told reporters following his floor remarks that Democrats should keep the attention on their message \u2014 that Republicans are hurting the middle class \u2014 rather than on what the Trump administration could pursue during a shutdown. Schumer said the message is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "The president congratulated Schumer Friday morning for \"doing the right thing,\" saying in a post on Truth Social that it took \"courage.\"",
      "The minority leader first informed Senate Democrats that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure during a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CBS News. As the meeting let out, frustrations appeared high among Senate Democrats, and a number of them \u2014 including many who hail from battleground states \u2014 quickly released statements on social media announcing they would vote \"no\" on the House-passed continuing resolution.",
      "Besides Schumer, only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, had pledged to support the continuing resolution heading into the day on Friday. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada became the third Democrat to pledge to support the measure to avert a shutdown ahead of the vote.",
      "Democrats continued to rail against their options on Friday morning. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator who had been engaged in bipartisan talks to fund the government, said the choice between a shutdown and letting the GOP bill pass \"has always been a false choice.\" She accused Republicans of pulling out of bipartisan negotiations and sending \"a deeply partisan bill here to the Senate today.\"",
      "\"Democrats did not have an ounce of input into writing this bill,\" Murray said. \"In my time in Congress, never, ever has one party written partisan full-year appropriations bills for all of government and expected the other party to go along without any input.\"",
      "Murray said the Senate could still pass the short-term funding measure that she introduced earlier this week, saying House Republicans could get on a plane to come back and vote.",
      "Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders returned to the Capitol Friday to express their opposition to the continuing resolution, calling this an \"unprecedented situation and an unprecedented disaster\" for the American people.",
      "\"We've been very clear: we strongly oppose the reckless Republican spending bill,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",

      "Former GOP Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a political legend whose quick wit bridged partisan gaps in the years before today's political acrimony, has died. He was 93.",
      "Simpson died early Friday after struggling to recover from a broken hip in December, according to a statement from his family and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, a group of museums where he was a board member for 56 years.",
      "\"He was an uncommonly generous man,\" Pete Simpson, his older brother, said in the statement. \"And I mean generous in an absolutely unconditional way. Giving of his time, giving of his energy \u2014 and he did it in politics and he did it in the family, forever.\"",
      "Along with former Vice President Dick Cheney, Simpson was a towering Republican figure from Wyoming, the nation's least populated state.",
      "Simpson was famous for his humor and often quipped, \"We have two political parties in this country, the Stupid Party and the Evil Party. I belong to the Stupid Party.\"",
      "A political moderate, Simpson's three terms as senator from 1979 to 1997 covered the Republican Party's rejuvenation under President Ronald Reagan. Simpson played a key role rallying GOP senators around the party's legislative agenda as a top Senate leader during that time.",
      "Simpson was better known for holding his own views, though, with sometimes caustic certainty. A deficit hawk with sharp descriptions of people who relied on government assistance, Simpson supported abortion rights.",
      "His Democratic friends included Robert Reich, who was labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Norman Mineta, the transportation secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "Simpson and Mineta met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyoming, during World War II.",
      "After leaving politics, both promoted awareness of the incarceration of some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in camps during the war. Mineta, who died in 2022, recalled that Simpson once was asked what was the biggest difference between them as a Republican and a Democrat.",
      "\"Alan thought about it and he said, 'Well, I wear size 15 shoes and he wears a size 8 and a half,'\" Mineta replied, according to the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.",

      "\"Dad and Pete have anchored the extended Simpson family for decades with the same love, humor, compassion and dedication their parents did before them,\" he said. \"Dad was a mighty force and with Mom's steady hand by his side we are so blessed and proud to have been along for the ride of a lifetime.\"",
      "In 2010, President Barack Obama tasked Simpson with co-leading a debt-reduction commission that developed a plan to save $4 trillion through tax hikes and spending cuts. The plan lacked support for serious consideration by Congress.",
      "At 6-foot-7, Simpson was literally a towering figure \u2014 tallest on record in the Senate until Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who is 6-foot-9, took office in 2017.",
      "Big as Simpson's shoes were, he had huge ones to fill politically.",

      "\"I saw Dad loved politics and the law, and I wanted to do that,\" Simpson once said.",
      "Simpson was born in Denver in 1931. After a childhood of reckless gun-shooting and vandalism in Cody that put him in danger and in trouble with the law, he graduated from Cody High School in 1949 and the University of Wyoming in 1954.",

      "After leaving the Army, Simpson got a law degree from the University of Wyoming in 1958 and joined his father's law practice, where he worked for the next 19 years. He was elected to the Wyoming House in 1964 and served there until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976.",
      "A football and basketball athlete at the University of Wyoming, Simpson fondly described politics as a \"contact sport.\"",
      "\"I've been called everything,\" he said in 2003. \"What the hell. If you don't like the combat, get out.\"",
      "Simpson's candor made him popular with voters. He also was known as a well-read, hardworking and sometimes hard-nosed politician involved in immigration, veterans' affairs and environmental issues.",
      "He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.",
      "Simpson opposed sentences of life without parole for juveniles and said he supported review of criminal sentences after a period of time.",

      "Some signs of the U.S. economy's trajectory, including consumer sentiment\u00a0plunging to a two-year low, U.S. stocks\u00a0sinking\u00a0and President Trump's foreign trade policy creating a climate of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, are pointing downward. There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",
      "Broad-based tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, plus 25% levies on steel and aluminum threaten to raise costs for both businesses and consumers. Smaller companies with tighter profit margins have a harder time absorbing greater input costs compared to larger ones.",
      "Canary in the coal mine",
      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",
      "\"These companies have much thinner margins, so a rise in input costs hurts them more,\" Carey Hall said.",

Eagles said Mooney attempted to cross the border with her visa paperwork and a job offer from a company in the U.S. An ICE spokesperson confirmed Mooney's detainment in a statement to CBS News, saying she didn't have legal documentation to be in the U.S.",

      "Henningsen added it was \"very, very early in the morning, when there was no daylight \u2026 close to 4 a.m.\"",
      "According to investigators, a day earlier on Oct. 7, Christopher Prichard snuck into an acquaintance's barn a few miles away from the kennels and later trekked through the woods in the middle of the night. Angela Prichard's sister, Wendy Budde, told \"48 Hours\" Christopher Prichard knew the combination to get inside.",
      "When Angela Prichard arrived in the morning to tend to the dogs, Christopher Prichard appeared with a shotgun. Angela Prichard called 911 almost immediately and is heard yelling \"please get out\" before yelling \"Chris!\" The sound of a gunshot can be heard on the 911 call. She ultimately named her killer.",
      "Just weeks earlier on Sept. 1, Angela Prichard had been granted a restraining order against her husband after she said she was continuously harassed, stalked and threatened by him. Angela Prichard had even left the home they shared and moved in with her sister. Nine days before Angela Prichard's murder, an arrest warrant was issued for Christopher Prichard for violating the restraining order. Angela Prichard's family tells\" 48 Hours\" police should have done more to arrest Christopher Prichard. They say in a small town like Bellevue, he was easy to find.",
      "After about 16 hours on the run, Christopher Prichard was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and robbery. He was found guilty and in March 2024, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",
      "Angela Prichard's family filed a lawsuit against the City of Bellevue and three police officers for failing to perform their job. In January 2025, a federal judge dismissed the case in its entirety and the family is now appealing the decision.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:50:00 -0400",
    "summary": "This week the EPA announced the rollback of a wide swath of regulations, many of which could worsen air quality. Experts say that could have implications for health.",
    "story": [
      "When the Environmental Protection Agency was formed in 1970, its mission was to protect the environment and human health. Since then, scientists, health experts and advocates have worked to implement regulations aimed at protecting and cleaning the air we breathe and the water we drink. Many of these regulations, which were aimed at cleaning up the air, also helped reduce carbon emissions, which can contribute to climate change \u2013 so it was a win for our bodies and the planet.",
      "But all this effort, experts say, might have been for naught, as this week the EPA \u2013 the department tasked with monitoring the nation's pollutants \u2013\u00a0 announced the rollback of a wide swath of environmental regulations, many of which could worsen air quality. And experts say that could have implications for health.",
      "More than 30 rules \u2013 including ones on emission standards for industrial air pollutants, passenger vehicles and coal-fired power plants \u2013 have been slashed.",
      "The EPA also said on Wednesday it would formally reconsider a landmark 2009 finding by the agency that greenhouse gases are a danger to public health and should be regulated.",
      "\"We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video statement.",
      "The reasoning behind the deregulation, according to Zeldin, is about economics, arguing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that, \"These actions will roll back trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes.\"",
      "Scientists, advocates and experts who have spent decades compiling the research needed to propel the regulations don't agree with Zeldin's assessment. Without the regulations, experts say, the U.S. could experience levels of air pollution seen in countries such as India, China or Saudi Arabia, exacerbating health issues for Americans.",
      "\"EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin today announced plans for the greatest increase in pollution in decades,\" said Amanda Leland, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental advocacy group. \"The result will be more toxic chemicals, more cancers, more asthma attacks, and more dangers for pregnant women and their children. Rather than helping our economy, it will create chaos.\"",
      "All of Zeldin's efforts to roll back such a wide variety of regulations will be challenged in court and could take years to litigate. \"This is a cluster bomb of moves to demolish a broad swath of environmental regulations. We'll see if it explodes in EPA's face when the inevitable barrage of lawsuits hits the courts,\" says environmental law expert Michael Gerrard.",
      "Here are three ways a possible rise in air pollutants stemming from the rollback of environmental regulations could affect Americans' health.",
      "Memory loss in Alzheimer's, brain disease",
      "Air pollution effects go far beyond the lungs and can create memory loss in the brain, and contribute to other diseases, scientists at Scripps Research found in research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month.",
      "Scientists discovered that pollutants found in environmental toxins, including automobile pollution and wildfire smoke, can result in elevated nitric oxide levels in the brain. These elevated levels can create a chemical change in the brain and accelerate brain aging and Alzheimer's.",
      "\"We've revealed the molecular details of how pollutants can contribute to memory loss and neurodegenerative disease,\" senior author and professor Stuart Lipton, a clinical neurologist, said in a statement.",
      "Miscarriages, stillborns and maternal health",
      "Numerous studies have shown how air pollution can affect maternal health and lead to miscarriages, stillborns and low birth weight. Further evidence shows that racial minority groups exposed to pollutants suffer from poor maternal health groups more than others in the United States. A 2023 review of hundreds of studies on the topic showed that Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to have babies with low birth weight and preterm births, with medical consequences that would extend through adulthood due to exposure to air pollution.",
      "Another 2025 study by researchers at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health showed exposure to pollution might cause difficulty for those trying to get pregnant through IVF. Exposure to organic carbon showed negative impacts with oocyte survival, fertilization and embryo quality, the study said.",
      "\"Air pollution is certainly an exposure of concern for those who are seeking to reproduce and conceive,\" said study author Dr. Sarah LaPointe in a statement.",
      "Researchers at Harvard found in a 2024 study that pregnant women's \"exposure to fine particulate air pollution was associated with altered immune responses that can lead to adverse birth outcomes.\"",
      "\"The study found that PM2.5 exposure can influence the histone profiles of pregnant women, disrupting the normal balance of cytokine genes and leading to increased inflammation in both women and fetuses,\" a news release said. \"In pregnant women, this increase in inflammation can correspond with adverse pregnancy outcomes.\"",
      "Asthma hits children hardest",
      "Air pollutants have long been linked to asthma, with children often suffering from the most adverse conditions. A 2024 study published in JAMA, a medical journal, found children exposed to air pollution during the first three years of life were more likely to get asthma in their elementary and middle school years. The risk of developing asthma can climb significantly for minority families living in urban communities because of air pollutants, the study found.",
      "The EPA has long supported research on children's health regarding asthma, which is among the most prevalent diseases in children worldwide. The agency found in 2009 that asthma affected 7.1 million (about 10%) of children in the United States.",
      "Another 2020 study published by researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark and published in the BMJ, a U.K. peer-reviewed medical journal, found children exposed to air pollutants are much more likely to develop asthma and persistent wheezing than those with limited exposure.",
      "American Lung Association President and CEO Harold Wimmer said rollbacks will increase pollution, more people will get sick, more children will have asthma attacks, and lives will be lost.",
      "\"Through this suite of actions, EPA is certainly creating a historic legacy: one of disregard for America's health,\" Wimmer said.",

      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",

      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \"get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\"Try saying something like, 'I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I'm entitled to under the law,'\" Ba\u00f1ez said. \"'Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.'\"",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower's financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\"You can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\" she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\"It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\" said Fugate, 42. \"And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\"",
      "In February, Fugate received confirmation that her application was received and had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\"And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\" she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\"",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\"I was months away from ending this nightmare,\" she said. \"Now I don't think that's going to happen. I'm kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",

      "Guinness, the Irish beer that has been around since before the American Revolution, is celebrating a renaissance with rapidly rising popularity in the United States.",
      "\"People are finding this beer for the first time, or, in some cases, rediscovering it,\" said Ryan Wagner, Guinness National Ambassador. \"You're not just finding it in Irish pubs. Now it's in sports bars, at the beach, in coolers being taken to tailgates.\"",

      "The legacy of Guinness",
      "The brewing legacy dates back to 1759 in Dublin. Today, 3.5 million pints are produced daily and shipped worldwide. Devoted fans insist the beer requires a specific \"perfect pour\" technique \u2014 a two-part process that affects both taste and texture.",

      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point. At the finish line, Holmes was presented with a $57,200 check for his victory, the\u00a0Anchorage Daily News reported.",

He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.

The couple's bodies weren't discovered until Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the Santa Fe home and alerted police, leaving a mystery for law enforcement and medical investigators to unravel.",
      "Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.",

    "summary": "A CDC program tests wastewater from airplanes, looking for pathogens that may have hitched a ride with passengers on long-haul international flights.",
    "story": [
      "In the past year, over 135 million passengers traveled to the U.S. from other countries. To infectious disease experts, that represents 135 million chances for an outbreak to begin. To identify and stop the next potential pandemic, government disease detectives have been discreetly searching for viral pathogens in wastewater from airplanes. Experts are worried that these efforts may not be enough.",
      "The CDC's Traveler Genomic Surveillance Program tests wastewater from airplanes, looking for pathogens that may have hitched a ride with passengers on long-haul international flights. This program operates with participating airlines at four major airports: Boston, San Francisco, New York's John F. Kennedy, and the Washington, D.C., area's Dulles.",
      "CBS News received exclusive on-site access to this program, which launched in September 2021 and has since expanded, thanks to a federal government grant of $120 million.",
      "In the time it takes to unload checked baggage, technicians collect a sample of wastewater from airplane lavatories. A courier ships these samples to a lab operated by private contractors at Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston. Researchers sift through the genetic material captured in each water sample, searching for infectious pathogens.",
      "\"We need to go find that needle in a haystack,\" explained Alex Plocik, Ginkgo's Biosecurity Genomics director. \"In theory, we can look at almost anything that is a potential biosecurity threat.\"",
      "One day, metagenomic sequencing, a technique used to analyze all of the genetic material in a sample, could allow researchers to detect new, previously unknown pathogens.",
      "\"These technologies are getting better all the time\u2026 that day is coming,\" said Plocik. However, for now, they are only testing for seven viruses: COVID-19, influenza A and B, adenovirus, norovirus, RSV, and mpox.",
      "Within 48 hours, wastewater testing can alert scientists if a passenger is carrying one of these viruses.",
      "Ginkgo shares the results with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and they're posted to a public dashboard to keep scientists around the world informed. (The most recent data posted is from Feb. 17. Neither the CDC nor the White House has commented on the program since President Trump took office.)",
      "Flight paths are tracked, allowing the CDC to see where the virus came from \u2014 information that can be particularly valuable when other countries are reluctant to share public health data. Government officials can use this intelligence to shape their public health response, which could include enhanced monitoring, contact tracing, and the administration of vaccines and preventive medications.",
      "But a dozen public health and national security experts consulted by CBS News expressed concern that the U.S. is not adequately prepared for another significant outbreak. While they are encouraged by technological advancements like airplane wastewater testing, some worry that the current program is too limited to reliably detect every incoming pathogen. At present, the CDC's airplane wastewater testing program is at only four airports, despite the fact that an estimated 333 international airports across the U.S. receive passengers, according to Department of Transportation data.",
      "Last September, CBS News sat down with Dr. David Fitter, the CDC's director of global migration health, to discuss the program and its impact. When asked if the U.S. is prepared for another pandemic, he paused for more than 10 seconds before answering. \"We've learned a lot from COVID. We've learned that we need early detection. We've learned about surveillance systems. We've learned about expanding testing capacity so that we can respond faster. We continue to learn, and I think that we are prepared to go forward,\" Fitter said.",
      "The coronavirus made its way to the U.S. on Jan. 15, 2020, when a 35-year-old American businessman disembarked from a flight in Washington state after visiting Wuhan, China. Unaware that he was infected, he became the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States. Public health officials are unsure if he was truly the first case in the country, as no tests were conducted on passengers or airplane wastewater at that time.",
      "\"Disease doesn't know geographic boundaries\"",
      "The CDC's airplane wastewater testing program is designed to act as radar for infectious diseases entering the country.",
      "\"Disease doesn't know geographic boundaries,\" explained Fitter. \"Our job is to stop disease from entering the U.S., and I think that's where it's helping us: we're able to detect early, respond faster.\"",
      "The CDC is monitoring various outbreaks around the world \u2014 including Marburg in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda, and mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 but of these, currently only has the capacity to test for mpox in airplane wastewater.",
      "As a proof of concept, the CDC's airplane wastewater testing program successfully detected new COVID variants three weeks before they appeared in municipal wastewater and two weeks before a surge in cases at doctors' offices. This advance warning provides public health officials and healthcare providers with lead time to prepare.",
      "\"Early warning could mean the difference between life and millions of deaths,\" said Admiral Brett Giroir, President Trump's COVID testing czar at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and now an infectious disease adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "While at DARPA years before the COVID pandemic, Giroir looked at wastewater testing as a surveillance tool to determine whether foreign facilities might be producing bioweapons. But he came to realize that wastewater testing had many potential applications. He was a big advocate for wastewater testing programs early in the COVID pandemic.",
      "\"If we see a spike going on, we don't wait until 300,000 people are in the emergency room. We know right away to raise the flag to get the vaccines up, to get antivirals, to get testing, to get everything started,\" said Giroir.",
      "Recently declassified U.S. intelligence warned that \"a pathogen can travel from a remote village to a major city in less than thirty-six hours.\"",
      "A report\u00a0released last spring by the National Intelligence Council stated that the COVID pandemic \"strained\" global health systems, \"diminished\" their ability to detect and respond to outbreaks, and undermined public trust in government, reducing people's willingness to follow public health guidance. The report further cautioned that while COVID was a once-in-a-century pandemic, odds are that it won't be the last for this generation, noting a \"nearly 28% chance that a pandemic at least as deadly as COVID-19 would occur during the decade.\"",
      "In January, one of President Trump's first official actions was to release a new CIA report suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was most likely caused by a lab leak in China. The world may never know for certain whether the pandemic originated from an animal-to-human spillover or a lab leak. However, expanding wastewater testing beyond municipal treatment plants and airplane wastewater could help provide answers in the future.",
      "\"The lesson I would like everyone to understand is that it doesn't matter whether it's natural or a lab leak\u2026 BSL-4 laboratories are a risk,\" Giroir said. Wastewater surveillance might be conducted in areas where humans come into close contact with domesticated animals or wildlife. \"One might even think of doing wastewater surveillance from the BSL-4 laboratory because if a person's infected, they use the toilet in that laboratory, and you might be able to detect that bug out of the wastewater knowing immediately that somebody got infected,\" Giroir said.",

      "\"We must diversify our trade partners and strengthen our security in so doing,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products April 2. He has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.",
      "Carney called the idea \"crazy.\"",
      "The U.S. trade war and Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "Carney said he's worked with Trump before at G7 and G20 summits during Trump's first presidency.",
      "\"We share some experiences. I have been in the private sector. I have worked in the real estate sector. I have done large transactions,\" Carney said. \"We will both be looking out for our countries but he knows, and I know from long experience, that we can find mutual solutions that win for both.\"",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surge.",

      "\"He will do very well. He's respected internationally,\" former Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien told reporters Friday. But, he added: \"There is no magic solution. This is not a normal situation. We've never seen someone who changes his mind every five minutes as president of the United States.\"",

Eagles said Mooney attempted to cross the border with her visa paperwork and a job offer from a company in the U.S. An ICE spokesperson confirmed Mooney's detainment in a statement to CBS News, saying she didn't have legal documentation to be in the U.S.",
      "Mooney was crossing the border to apply for a temporary visa known as a TN visa, which she had previously obtained successfully, according to Canadian broadcaster Global News. The TN visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the U.S. in certain professional jobs under the terms of the North American free trade pact known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Her visa was denied, and she was held at the San Ysidro border crossing in Southern California for three nights, according to Eagles. She was then transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego and held for another three nights.",

      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said he hopes dialogue can resolve the trade war between the U.S. and the European Union after President Trump Thursday threatened to impose 200% retaliatory tariffs on European wines and alcohols.",
      "The tariffs were a response to the European Union's counter-tariffs against Mr. Trump's initial steel and aluminum hikes.",
      "\"I think it's a lot of uncertainty at the moment,\" Martin said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"Overall, tariffs are damaging to trade, damaging to businesses, but also damaging to consumers, because they will lead to an increase in prices for consumers. I don't think that's good, either way. So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"",
      "Martin said that Mr. Trump was \"very conscious of the goods surplus that Ireland has, particularly through the pharmaceutical issue.\"",
      "\"But if you put services into the mix, of course Ireland is in deficit,\" he said.",
      "Martin described the U.S. and Ireland's economic relationship as a \"two-way street\" and touted his country's investment in the U.S., including over 700 Irish companies that he said were responsible for the creation of more than 200,000 jobs in the U.S. Martin also highlighted that Irish airline, Ryanair, had recently placed an order for over 400 Boeing aircraft.",
      "When added with another Irish company AerCap's purchase of 150 Boeing aircraft last year, Irish-owned companies were \"the largest purchaser of Boeing aircraft outside the United States,\" he said.",
      "\"In an absolute worst-case scenario, say, a 25% increase across the board on tariffs, a tit-for-tat from both sides \u2014 a Boeing 787, the price will go up by $40 million,\" AerCap's CEO Aengus Kelly said Wednesday on CNBC. \"No one's going to want to pay that.\"",
      "Kelly said European companies would likely buy aircraft manufactured by Airbus, which is a European company, if Mr. Trump's tariffs are applied.",
      "Asked about his meetings with the president Wednesday at the White House, Martin described them as \"positive meetings\" that celebrated the \"historic ties between the two countries.\" He called Mr. Trump a \"gracious host\" who has an \"affection for Ireland.\"",

    "story": [
      "Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance and the public to inform on women refusing to wear the country's mandatory headscarf in public, even as hard-liners push for harsher penalties for those protesting the law, a United Nations report released Friday found.",
      "The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the \"physical violence\" that led to the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death led to nationwide protests against the country's mandatory hijab laws and the public disobedience against them that continues today, despite the threat of violent arrest and imprisonment.",
      "\"Two and a half years after the protests began in September 2022, women and girls in Iran continue to face systematic discrimination, in law and in practice, that permeates all aspects of their lives, particularly with respect to the enforcement of the mandatory hijab,\" the report said.",
      "\"The state is increasingly reliant on state-sponsored vigilantism in an apparent effort to enlist businesses and private individuals in hijab compliance, portraying it as a civic responsibility.\"",
      "Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the findings of the 20-page report.",
      "In it, U.N. investigators outline how Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance. Among the efforts include Iranian officials deploying \"aerial drone surveillance\" to monitor women in public places. At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities installed facial recognition software at its entrance gate to also find women not wearing the hijab, it said.",
      "Surveillance cameras on Iran's major roadways also are believed to be involved in searching for uncovered women. U.N. investigators said they obtained the \"Nazer\" mobile phone app offered by Iranian police, which allows \"vetted\" members of the public and the police to report on uncovered women in vehicles, including ambulances, buses, metro cars and taxis.",
      "\"Users may add the location, date, time and the license plate number of the vehicle in which the alleged mandatory hijab infraction occurred, which then 'flags' the vehicle online, alerting the police,\" the report said. \"It then triggers a text message (in real-time) to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them that they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws, and that their vehicles would be impounded for ignoring these warnings.\"",
      "Those text messages have led to dangerous situations. In July 2024, police officers shot and paralyzed a woman who activists say had received such a message and was fleeing a checkpoint near the Caspian Sea.",
      "Amini's death sparked months of protests and a security crackdown that killed more than 500 people and led to the detention of more than 22,000. After the mass demonstrations, police dialed down enforcement of hijab laws, but it ramped up again in April 2024 under what authorities called the Noor - or \"Light\" - Plan. At least 618 women have been arrested under the Noor Plan, the U.N. investigators said, citing a local human rights activist group in Iran.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran executed at least 938 people last year, a threefold increase from 2021, the U.N. said. While many were convicted of drug charges, the report said the executions \"indicate a nexus with the overall repression of dissent in this period.\"",
      "\"This is in line with the authorities' longstanding use of the death penalty and executions to instill fear and as a tool of political repression against dissenting voices, including protesters and minorities,\" the U.N. report said.",
      "As Iran continues its crackdown over the hijab, it also faces an economic crisis over U.S. sanctions due to its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While U.S. President Donald Trump has called for new negotiations, Iran has yet to respond to a letter he sent to its 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Social unrest, coupled with the economic woes, remain a concern for Iran's theocracy.",

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but that the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin said during a news conference in Moscow.",
      "\"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said, adding that he could discuss those details in another phone conversation with President Trump.",
      "Putin noted that Ukrainian troops are encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and said it would be necessary to determine before a ceasefire whether they will lay down weapons and surrender. He also noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce, though the Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out Western troops being deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers.",
      "\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" said Putin, who has always blamed the war and his full-scale invasion that sparked it on Ukraine.",
      "He said that while the U.S. had apparently persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv was interested in a truce because of the battlefield situation.",
      "\"In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.",
      "Putin spoke hours after a senior U.S. envoy arrived in Moscow to discuss the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, and less than a day after he made a first visit to his commanders in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and promising the full recapture of the region.",
      "On Wednesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Russian troops had made \"significant gains\" in Kursk over the past week. Russia has been maneuvering to surround the Ukrainian forces who launched a surprise incursion into Kursk months ago, and they have succeeded in doing so to the extent that the Ukrainians will likely soon have to decide whether to withdraw back into Ukraine, or be cut off from their supply lines, the American official told CBS News a day before Putin made essentially the same assertion.",
      "The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops in Kursk came amid Mr. Trump's push for a rapid diplomatic end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials made progress on how to stop the fighting during talks held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"It's up to Russia now,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday, as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it refuses to engage with his peace efforts, saying Wednesday that, \"in a financial sense, we could do things very bad for Russia. It would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, was heading to Moscow for talks with Russian officials, possibly including Putin. His plane touched down in Moscow on Thursday morning, but his schedule was not revealed.",
      "Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said after meeting Thursday with U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, who was with Witkoff in Moscow, that the U.S. proposal for a one-month ceasefire failed to take into account Russia's position, and would need reworking, according to Russian media.",
      "\"The document, it seems to me, has a hasty character,\" Ushakov said, according to Russia's state-run RIA news agency \"Itwill be necessary to work, think and take into account our position, too. It outlines only the Ukrainian approach.\"",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out accepting any agreement that sees Western forces deployed in Ukraine to help maintain a peace, something many European nations have said will be needed, though only Britain and France have suggested any willingness to do so.",
      "By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war \u2014 whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington.",
      "The Ukrainian army's foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from a renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "But given the recent Russian advances, Putin did not look like a man who was interested in ordering his forces to lay down their weapons on Wednesday as he visited troops in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and talking strategy with his commanders. He said he expected the military \"to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.\"",
      "Putin added that going forward, \"it's necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,\" in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine's neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal.",
      "Ukraine launched the summer raid into Kursk in a bid to counter the increasingly glum news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks.

    "story": [
      "During a meeting on Wednesday with Ireland's leader Michel Martin, President Trump made an offhand remark that was quickly picked up in the Middle East as a major change in his stance on the war-torn Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million Palestinian inhabitants.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "That came after he repeatedly said that under his own proposal to rebuild Gaza, all of its residents would be moved out, while the U.S. moved in to \"take over\" the coastal territory to turn it into a luxury real estate development. Just a month ago, Mr. Trump was clear that, in his mind, not only would Palestinians need to leave Gaza, they would not be permitted to return.",
      "That plan was roundly and clearly rejected by Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump had said would take in the displaced masses.",
      "Egypt, which has led efforts to present an alternative plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing Palestinians, welcomed the change in tone by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Egypt expresses its appreciation for the statements made by U.S. President, Donald Trump\u2026 regarding the non-displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip,\" the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \"Egypt affirms that this position reflects an understanding of the importance of avoiding further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Strip and the necessity of working towards finding just and sustainable solutions to the Palestinian cause.\"",
      "Hamas, the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist organization that sparked the war in Gaza with its brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, also cautiously welcomed the shift in Mr. Trump's rhetoric.",
      "\"If Trump's statements represent a retreat from the idea of Palestinian displacement, then they are welcomed,\" a statement from the group's spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came Wednesday after his senior envoy Steve Witkoff met with the foreign ministers of five Arab nations in Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future. That future, regardless of what reconstruction plan is eventually implemented, can only start taking shape once there is an official end to the war, however.",
      "A fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has largely kept the peace since January 19, but the two sides have not yet agreed on whether to extend the first phase of the agreement, or to move onto a second phase as originally envisioned. The dialogue in Doha, Qatar, involving delegations from the host-nation as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and the U.S. is aimed at pushing the process forward \u2013 and keeping the guns silent in Gaza.",
      "The five Arab nations involved have pushed the Egyptian-crafted alternative to Mr. Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal in their talks with American officials.",
      "The Arab plan, the rough outline of which officials shared with CBS News earlier this month, carries a price tag of $53 billion and envisions all of the enclave's residents remaining in Gaza throughout the years-long reconstruction. The Trump administration initially rejected the plan, with U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes issuing a statement saying it failed to \" address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said at the time, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "It appeared on Wednesday, with Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, that those further talks with America's regional partners may have convinced the White House that displacing the entire population of Gaza was not a tenable proposition.",
      "\"The Arab foreign ministers presented the Gaza reconstruction plan, which was approved at the Arab Summit held in Cairo on March 4, 2025,\" the five Arab nations that met in Doha said in a joint statement shared Wednesday. \"They also agreed with the U.S. envoy to continue consultations and coordination on this plan as a basis for the reconstruction efforts in the sector.\"",
      "That Egyptian plan has been adopted by the broad Muslim solidarity group of 57 countries known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It envisions the Gaza Strip eventually being run by the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not by Hamas.",
      "That will likely prove an ongoing point of contention as the PA holds little support among Palestinians and has been dismissed as a potential future Gaza administrator by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, showing there's still much negotiation ahead if Mr. Trump is to make good on his vows to end the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.",

      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to cite the 18th-century statute to order the swift detention and deportation of suspected members of the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with prison origins that his administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",
      "\"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",

      "As for his timetable for making a decision, Sununu said on Friday in an interview on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" that he would \"take a few weeks to think about it.\"",

I know that sounds arrogant. . . . I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just saying things are the ABCs of me winning.\"",

You know, specifically just the priority. I mean, back then, I had Republicans in the U.S. Senate telling me balancing budgets didn\u2019t matter,\" Sununu elaborated.",

      "Sununu, who regularly highlights that he is a \"budget hawk,\" pointed to President Donald Trump's recently created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aims to overhaul and downsize the federal government. DOGE, steered by Elon Musk, the world's richest person and the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, has swept through federal agencies, rooting out what the White House argues was billions in wasteful federal spending. It has also taken a meat cleaver to the federal workforce, resulting in a massive downsizing of employees. The moves by DOGE have triggered a slew of lawsuits in response.",

They\u2019re taking their job seriously.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "5 ways you can protect your personal data",
      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The malicious extension highlights that Google isn\u2019t doing enough to keep malware off its platform. Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users. Google needs to step up its security efforts and put user privacy front and center.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",

      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",

Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.

On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",

      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",

      "Red flags: Spotting the scam",
      "Jane's text message exhibits several telltale signs of a scam that everyone should be aware of:",
      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",
      "Too good to be true offers: Be skeptical of messages promising large returns or unexpected windfalls.",
      "Pressure tactics: Scammers often use threatening language or impose tight deadlines to manipulate you into acting quickly without thinking.",

      "1. Never click suspicious links in text messages: In Jane's case, clicking the link could have led to a fake Kinecta website designed to steal her login credentials.",
      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention. Your vigilance not only protected you but also helps educate others. Together, we can stay one step ahead of scammers and protect our finances.",

      "There are numerous obstacles when it comes to the Trump\u00a0administration\u2019s attempt to negotiate with Putin, including arguments over occupied territory, international recognition of occupied lands, international aid and support for Ukraine, international confiscation of frozen Russian assets, Zelenskyy\u2019s standing at home, the return of prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children, according to Peter Rough, senior fellow and director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at\u00a0the Hudson\u00a0Institute.",
      "\"Putin has officially annexed four Ukrainian oblasts as well as Crimea. But Moscow has yet to conquer any of the four entirely,\" Rough told Fox News Digital while traveling to Ukraine. \"I can\u2019t imagine that Ukraine will withdraw from the areas they control, having fought tooth and nail to defend those regions.",
      "\"I also doubt that the West will offer de jure recognition to the areas Moscow controls,\" he added. \"So, Putin would have to swallow all of that in a peace deal.\"",
      "Each issue alone is a massive undertaking to negotiate, and\u00a0while Ukraine this week may be outlining concessions it could make to secure a deal coordinated by the U.S., Putin is unlikely to do the same, according to Koffler, who briefed NATO years ahead of the 2022 invasion on Putin\u2019s plans.",
      "RUBIO SAYS MINERAL DEAL \u2018NOT MAIN TOPIC ON AGENDA\u2019 IN UKRAINE MEETING",
      "\"Putin is unlikely to make any concessions as he believes he is in a strong position,\" Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"The disparity in combat potential dramatically favors Russia over Ukraine, which is out-manned and outgunned because Putin transitioned the Russian military and economy on a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\"",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Sept. 18, 2023. (Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool)",
      "\"Putin believes he has prepared Russia to fight till the last Ukrainian and till the last missile in NATO\u2019s arsenal,\" she added, echoing a January warning issued by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who said Russia\u2019s defense industry output over a three-month period equates to what all of NATO produces an entire year.",
      "\"Putin is highly unlikely to agree to a ceasefire because he doesn\u2019t want to give a strategic pause to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO to re-arm,\" Koffler said. \"He doesn\u2019t trust Washington. He doesn\u2019t trust President Trump any more than we trust Putin.",
      "\"He trusts Trump even less than Biden because he could read Biden and predict his behavior. He cannot read Trump because Trump is unpredictable.\"",
      "The experts argued there are too many variables that could play out during negotiations that will determine whether Putin can be adequately held accountable or \"trusted\" regarding future agreements.",

      "Their nightmare was supposed to be over.",
      "UN WARNS OF 'FRIGHTENING AND DISTURBING' ACTIVITY BY MILITARY, REBELS IN WESTERN BURMA",
      "Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they\u2019ll be sent home.",
      "One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.",
      "\"If we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?\" he asked.",
      "The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees\u2019 home governments.",
      "It\u2019s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.",
      "The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them.",
      "A high-profile crackdown",
      "The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.",
      "People from China, Vietnam and Ethiopia, believed to have been trafficked and forced to work in scam centers, sit with their faces masked while in detention after being released from the centers in Myawaddy district in eastern Myanmar, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Thanaphon Wuttison)",
      "\"Your passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,\" a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press.",
      "Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry\u2019s spread.",
      "Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release.",
      "Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.",
      "Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar \u2014 the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army \u2014 asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.",
      "From forced labor to detention",
      "As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river\u2019s width from freedom.",
      "Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February.",
      "For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.",
      "Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.",
      "\"It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\" said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.",
      "Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.",
      "An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they\u2019re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic.",
      "Waiting for a $600 plane ticket",
      "Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming.",
      "China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.",
      "Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move \"as quickly as possible\" to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.",
      "\"The ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,\" Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.",
      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\"You can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\" she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \"I think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\"",
      "Assistance is scarce",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\" said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

The bosses, he said, are \"rich as hell\" and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\"My friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\" he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \"Is anyone coming for us?\""

      "That comment was in direct conflict with M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, who just hours earlier told reporters that the Trump administration \u201cwas engaging in a trade war against Canada\u201d and European countries. On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union after slapping 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada on Wednesday.",

The newly frosty relationship between the longtime allies unfolded as frigid temperatures greeted the foreign ministers when they first arrived for the meeting on Tuesday. On Thursday, Trump once again mocked Canada from the Oval Office as the diplomats met in Qu\u00e9bec.",

      "\u201cCanada\u2019s sovereignty is not up for debate,\u201d she said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic tussle between the U.S. and Canada also escalated in Ottawa Friday as Mark Carney was sworn in as the new prime minister.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. His point is crazy. That\u2019s it,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States.\u201d",
      "After initially stressing that the topic did not come up during his conversations with G7 diplomats, Rubio was pressed about whether Trump was serious when he says Canada should become the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe Canadian government has made their position, how they feel about it clear. The president has made his argument as to why he thinks Canada would be better off joining the United States for economic purposes,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere\u2019s a disagreement between the President\u2019s position and the position of the Canadian government.\u201d",
      "Rubio also noted the president says he loves Canada.",
      "Joly said she was trying to find an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to the trade dispute, but Rubio claimed there was no need for one because this was about the U.S. resetting its trade policy.",
      "Rubio also said Trump\u2019s tariff policy was not hostile to countries around the world, despite Trump calling the European Union \u201chostile and abusive\u201d Thursday on social media. In the Oval Office later in the day, Trump added: \u201cThe European Union is very, very nasty.\u201d",
      "During an interview with NBC News, Kaja Kallas, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security policy, said it was an overall \u201cgood\u201d G7 meeting and touted the discussions about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and a variety of issues. But she acknowledged the EU\u2019s diplomats didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s Thursday comments.",

Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had famously clashed with Trump in the Oval Office over the issue of the U.S. providing security guarantees to move along a peace deal.",
      "Speaking with reporters, Rubio also touted a \u201cpositive and productive engagement\u201d between Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladamir Putin Thursday in Moscow, but he declined to speculate about the next steps in any ceasefire negotiations because Witkoff was still en route back to the U.S.",

Trump opened by noting the nations \"share much more than a border,\" highlighting \"the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together \u2014 which we have.\"",
      "\"America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada,\" Trump said. \"We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges, and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce.\"",

This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It\u2019s so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"",

We have more than they do. We don\u2019t need anything. We don\u2019t need their cars. I\u2019d much rather make the cars here. And there\u2019s not a thing that we need. Now, there will be a little disruption, but it won\u2019t be very long. But they need us. We really don\u2019t need them. And we have to do this. I\u2019m sorry.\"",
      "Trump has been unapologetic in his quest to conquer the Canadians \u2014\u00a0an effort he said in January would be conducted by \u201ceconomic force.\u201d The result has been a disintegration of the relationship between the U.S. and one of its closest allies, and a stock market plunge over fears of ever-increasing escalation of a trade war. Both Canadian officials and Republicans initially thought the president was merely joking, ribbing Trudeau \u2014 a longtime foil \u2014 after they met at Mar-a-Lago in November. It was after that visit that Trump first publicly floated the notion of absorbing Canada. Few think he\u2019s joking now, and the Canadians have stopped laughing.",
      "A source with direct knowledge of the discussions told NBC News that Trump is heavily focused on Canada in conversations with aides, who believe he is completely serious about making the country the 51st state \u2014\u00a0even with Trudeau out of power and a new prime minister in place.",
      "'No clue where that is coming from'",
      "There isn\u2019t exactly a groundswell of support for the idea. At a heated town hall in his district on Thursday, Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., was pointedly asked whether he supported Trump\u2019s push to annex Canada and Greenland.",
      "\"No,\" Edwards said. \"I do not.\"",
      "While Canadians said Trump did privately joke to Trudeau about Canada becoming a state during the president\u2019s first term, several officials who worked in Trump\u2019s White House said the broad assault on Canadian sovereignty was not born out of any conversations at the time. In fact, these former officials said they have no recollection of Trump ever raising the issue.",
      "\"Never, ever heard him mention it,\" one former White House official said. \"Ever. No clue where that is coming from.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans similarly did not recall such an idea being discussed in his first term.",
      "\"That\u2019s probably three nos,\" Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., said when asked if he recalled Trump expressing interest in acquiring Canada, redrawing borders or renegotiating treaties with the Canadians. \"No. At least in my recollection, this is all kind of new territory.\"",
      "A 68-page national security report Trump signed in December 2017 included only one mention of America\u2019s northern neighbor: \"Canada and the United States share a unique strategic and defense partnership.\"",
      "In private, Trump has made specific demands the Canadians say they could never agree to. The president made clear in a phone call with Trudeau last month that he wants to revise the boundary between the two nations set by a 1908 border treaty, as two Canadian officials said and was previously reported by The New York Times and Toronto Star.",
      "If Trump truly objects to the boundary line, the proper forum to resolve the dispute is the International Court of Justice, a Canadian official said.",
      "The president has also mentioned renegotiating agreements that dictate how the Great Lakes and Columbia River are governed, the official told NBC News, adding that Trump wants to control the Northwest Passage, a maritime path that begins west of Greenland and cuts through Northern Canada to the Arctic Ocean.",
      "\"He wants our water,\" the Canadian official added. \"He wants to take the water.\"",
      "Marc Miller, the Canadian minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, said that for Trump, Canada\u2019s allure is its natural resources. The president separately wants American access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as compensation for the aid given to the war-torn country.",
      "\"I do think that Mr. Trump looks at our natural resources and has that acquisitive mind behind it,\" Miller said, calling Trump\u2019s claims of the U.S. subsidizing Canada for $200 billion misleading.",
      "Miller said Canadians started truly taking Trump\u2019s threats of annexation seriously after his inauguration. He voiced disappointment that more allies have not spoken up in Canada\u2019s defense.",
      "\"I can\u2019t say this was totally predicted. Nor can anyone,\" Miller said. \"Frustratingly among our allies, everyone is ducking for cover.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A battle to be treated 'fairly'",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has enacted wide-ranging and steep tariffs on a litany of Canadian goods. There have been some walkbacks. And then there has been escalation. Canada has instituted retaliatory measures. And the tit-for-tat trade war has intensified on a near daily basis.",
      "Canada is one of the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners, with nearly 80% of Canadian exports marked for the U.S. The country provides about 60% of U.S. crude oil imports, 85% of electricity imports and is also the biggest exporter of steel and aluminum into the U.S.",
      "\"Well, I think Canada is a neighbor,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Tuesday briefing. \"They are a partner. They have always been an ally. Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.\"",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t provided Canada with an obvious off-ramp for the tensions, either. He has objected to what he describes as steep Canadian tariffs on dairy imports from the U.S. and highlighted the importance of U.S. metals production. But he has also said a lead reason for the trade war is Canada's lack of urgency in dealing with the fentanyl crisis \u2014 even though just 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized by U.S. border agents entering the country from Canada during the last fiscal year, compared to 21,100 pounds coming from Mexico. And he has wrongly claimed American banks are not allowed to do business north of the border; the Canadian Banking Association said last month that 16 U.S. banks currently operate in Canada.",
      "\"Clearly, the president is looking for some results,\" said Amodei, who launched the bipartisan American Canadian Economy and Security Caucus in 2023 and reintroduced a House resolution affirming the U.S.-Canada partnership last month. \"I'm not sure those results are clearly defined.\"",
      "Amodei said Trump is above all looking for the U.S. to be \"treated fairly\" on trade, as Trump has pointed to examples where he believes Canada is not doing so.",
      "\"When you say, well, you want to be treated fairly, the question is, OK, define fairly.\" Amodei said. \"And I don\u2019t think 'fairly' is defined at the moment.\"",
      "Canadians view Trump\u2019s push to expand the U.S. into Canadian territory as beyond unfair. Mark Carney, the former Canadian and British central banker who was sworn in as prime minister on Friday, described \u201cdark days\u201d ahead for his nation after being elected to lead the Liberal Party.",
      "\"These are dark days \u2014 dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\" he said. \"We are getting over the shock \u2014 but let us never forget the lessons. We have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other.\"",
      "He has since said he is ready to negotiate a renewed trade deal \u2014\u00a0Trump already renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement during his first term \u2014\u00a0so long as his nation\u2019s sovereignty is respected.",
      "\"If he wanted Canada \u2014 if he really wanted it \u2014 he\u2019s harmed the prospects of Canada being the 51st state by the way he\u2019s approached it,\" said John Bolton, a national security adviser during Trump\u2019s first term who has since broken with him.",
      "'Canada is a sovereign state'",
      "Trump's rhetoric is not necessarily being matched by other members of his administration. During a confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump\u2019s pick to serve as ambassador to Canada, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., said \"Canada is a sovereign state,\" suggesting that the president\u2019s push for annexation was due to his relationship with Trudeau.",
      "Asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., how he can heal a \"negative relationship that has developed because of the president\u2019s statements,\" while \"addressing tariff issues,\" Hoekstra responded: \"Obviously, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about that myself.\"",
      "Nearly 800 miles north of Washington, D.C., at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Quebec, reporters pressed Secretary of State Marco Rubio about Trump\u2019s push to make Canada the 51st state. Rubio said there would be no such conversation at the G7 gathering.",
      "\"It is not a meeting about how we\u2019re going to take over Canada,\" Rubio said.",
      "Questioned further by NBC News at the conclusion of the gathering of foreign ministers on Friday, Rubio further explained the president's position.",
      "\"I\u2019ll tell you how that came about,\" Rubio said of promoting the annexation of Canada. \"OK, he\u2019s in a meeting with Trudeau, and Trudeau basically says that if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canada, Canada couldn\u2019t survive as a nation state, at which point the president said, 'well, then you should become a state.'\"",
      "Trump, Rubio said, \"made an argument for why Canada would be better off joining the United States from an economic perspective and the like.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s made that argument repeatedly,\" Rubio continued. \"And I think it stands for itself.\"",
      "A senior State Department official described \"a need to separate out trade policy\" from \"broader cooperation on foreign affairs, and that\u2019s challenging.\"",
      "\"But there is broad agreement that we cannot allow real disagreements on certain issues to prevent us from working together on areas of agreement, especially critical foreign policy issues including migration, China, and of course Russia and Ukraine,\" this person added.",
      "What also confounds Republicans about Trump\u2019s idea is that annexing Canada would potentially add millions more Democrats to American voter rolls. Canada is a liberal-leaning nation with a population larger than California. Were Canada to become a state, it could mean 50 more House seats and two additional senators \u2014 auguring a real power shift in government.",
      "\"They\u2019d have a sizable delegation in the House,\" Amodei said. \u201c\"I don\u2019t think anybody thinks that\u2019s a great idea. Oh, by the way, how many Electoral College votes are they going to get?\"",
      "Trump\u2019s history of managing the U.S.-Canada relationship is intertwined with his own personal relationship with Trudeau who, up until this week, has been his only Canadian counterpart. At times, their relationship has been fruitful, like when they reworked the trade agreement governing commerce between their nations. But there has been animosity, too.",
      "Now, annexation threats have ignited a \"wave of patriotism in Canada\" unlike any Miller has seen.",
      "\"Not hiding the fact that it can do a lot more damage to Canada than the U.S.,\" Miller said, noting the U.S. is Canada\u2019s top trading partner. \"But we have a high pain threshold and we\u2019re ready to fight.\"",
      "There\u2019s a reason Canada believes it can win the fight, too. Its citizenry is united against relinquishing its national sovereignty, while the U.S. is divided over Trump's trade war \u2014 especially as the stock market slides.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s position is vulnerable because he doesn\u2019t have the support of the American business community,\" the Canadian official said. \"And we know that.\""

      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges in the case and vehemently denied allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct detailed in dozens of civil lawsuits filed by women and men.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs has said it before and will say it again: he vehemently denies the accusations\u201d made by federal prosecutors, Combs\u2019 lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in a statement ahead of Friday\u2019s hearing. \u201cHe looks forward to his day in court when it will become clear that he has never forced anyone to engage in sexual acts against their will.\u201d",
      "The judge said jury selection will begin May 5, with the trial tentatively slated to start May 12.",
      "The superseding indictment contains no new charges. But it describes Combs\u2019 attempts to keep an extreme level of control over his employees, \u201cwhom he forced to work long hours with little sleep,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "Combs made these demands \u201cthrough the use of, among other things, physical force, psychological harm, financial harm, and reputational harm, and/or threats of the same,\u201d according to the indictment.",
      "In one case, Combs forced an employee to \u201cengage in sex acts\u201d with him, the indictment states.",

      "Friday\u2019s hearing partly concerned footage, originally obtained and aired by CNN, showing Combs beating an ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, at a hotel in 2016.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers have alleged that the video aired by CNN was \u201csubstantially altered.\u201d CNN has forcefully denied that claim, with a spokesperson saying in a statement: \u201cCNN never altered the video and did not destroy the original copy of the footage, which was retained by the source.\u201d",
      "Subramanian, the judge, told lawyers Friday to reach a compromise on the role the video might play during the trial. If they can\u2019t compromise, he added, they will need to file formal motions."

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reportedly targeted a manufacturer of poppers, an inhalant drug that has gained increasingly mainstream popularity as an adjunct to clubbing and sexual activity. The drug has long been sold in convenience stores under a legal loophole.",
      "Double Scorpio, an Austin-based poppers manufacturer, issued a statement on its website Thursday stating that the company had \u201cstopped all operations following a search and seizure at our offices by the FDA.\u201d",
      "The reported raid comes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the helm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with a history of drug addiction and false claims about vaccines in particular, has erroneously suggested that poppers and other drug use, not HIV, cause AIDS. However, what led to the reported raid or whether Kennedy had any knowledge of it is unclear.",
      "The news about the FDA search and seizure was first released by Fast Company, which reported based on anonymous sources that a broader crackdown was underway.",
      "When asked about whether the FDA is cracking down on any manufacturers of poppers, Amanda M. Hils, an FDA spokesperson, said the agency, as a matter of policy, \u201cdoes not comment on possible criminal investigations.\u201d",
      "HHS did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Nor did Double Scorpio.",
      "A representative of another company, The Popper King \u2014 which is based in Buffalo, New York, and brands its website as the \u201cpremiere site to buy poppers online\u201d \u2014 said the business had not been contacted by the FDA. The representative said she could not discuss the matter further; she declined to reveal her name and did not provide a reason.",
      "Alkyl nitrates, or poppers, which are meant to be inhaled, cause an immediate and short-lasting euphoric rush along with muscle relaxation. The drug has long been popular among gay men, in part because it can relax the sphincter muscle and make anal sex less painful and otherwise more pleasurable.",
      "Side effects include headache, rapid heart rate, visual disturbances, dizziness and flushing in the face. Poppers can also cause an abnormal amount of hemoglobin to collect in the blood, low red blood cells, damage to the eyes and skin inflammation and irritation.",
      "The FDA issued an advisory in 2021 warning consumers not to purchase or use poppers, stating that \u201cthese products can result in serious adverse health effects, including death, when ingested or inhaled.\u201d The advisory stated: \u201cThe FDA has observed an increase in reports of deaths and hospitalizations with issues such as severe headaches, dizziness, increase in body temperature, difficulty breathing, extreme drops in blood pressure, blood oxygen issues (methemoglobinemia) and brain death after ingestion or inhalation of nitrite \u2018poppers.\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Adam Zmith, the author of \u201cDeep Sniff: a History of Poppers and Queer Futures,\u201d amyl nitrate, a close cousin to the chemical most widely used as poppers today, was first identified by a French chemist in 1844. By the late 19th century, doctors used it to ease chest pain, because it affects blood flow to the heart. The drug, Zmith said, became popular with gay men in New York and San Francisco beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was available without a prescription from pharmacists.",
      "Though Congress has tried to regulate and ban some iterations of poppers, they have long persisted in a legal gray area.\u00a0According to\u00a0a\u00a0report\u00a0in the August issue of California Legal Review, it is illegal to sell poppers for recreational use under U.S. law. As a result, the report notes,\u00a0some manufacturers have gotten around this by marketing these chemicals for commercial purposes, such as air fresheners, leather cleaners and nail polisher removers.\u00a0Poppers can now be found in smoke shops and convenience stories with brand names such as Rush, Jungle Juice and Locker Room.",
      "Poppers, AIDS and RFK Jr.",
      "After the first signs of the AIDS epidemic were identified among gay men in 1981, scientists initially investigated whether the use of party drugs, including poppers, was causing the catastrophic collapse of the immune system in a rapidly increasing number of gay men. But after HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS in 1983, it became clear that poppers, though they cause disinhibition and are correlated with sexual behaviors that drive HIV transmission, were not the central culprit.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy has lent credence to the unsupported theory that poppers caused AIDS. He asserted in an undated speech, unearthed in 2023, that during the early 1980s, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who became the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984, essentially won a scientific \u201cpower struggle\u201d to claim AIDS was caused by an infectious disease and that this, Kennedy said, \u201callowed him to take control of it.\u201d Instead, Kennedy falsely argued, HIV was a mere \u201cpassenger virus\u201d and suggested that it was the \u201cgay lifestyle\u201d of poppers use and heavy partying that was driving an \u201cautoimmunity\u201d among them.",
      "There is no proven causal link between poppers and AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that is primarily sexually transmitted and infects immune cells. Left untreated, it destroys the immune system over time, leaving the body vulnerable to infections, and is nearly universally fatal.",
      "Poppers: convenient to obtain, easy to misuse",
      "According to a 2020 study, 3.3% of American adults surveyed from 2015 to 2017 reported ever using poppers, including 35% of gay men. Recent reports suggest that poppers have recently made inroads among heterosexuals as well.",
      "Joseph J. Palamar, an associate professor in population health at NYU Langone Health, studies poppers use. He shared statistics with NBC News, not yet peer-reviewed, that his team has been collecting in recent years by surveying attendees of New York City nightclubs. Of the more than 1,400 club attendees surveyed in 2024, 18% reported using poppers during the past year, including 46% of gay and bisexual men, 28% of lesbian and bisexual women, 10% of heterosexual women and 6% of heterosexual men.",
      "While he said he could not give precise poisoning and death figures because they were pending publication, Palamar said that nationwide, reports to poison control centers about poppers causing serious adverse health events have been increasing and that there have been a few associated deaths in recent years. He speculated that the most severe poisonings might be related to people drinking poppers.",
      "Palamar said that the fact that poppers are often sold in convenience stores next to energy drinks, and are packaged such that they resemble energy-drink shots themselves, may mislead people who are new to the drug to falsely believe they are meant to be drunk.",
      "Ignorance about the drugs among store employees may be driving especially dangerous use of poppers, new research has suggested.",
      "For a study published in Clinical Toxicology on Wednesday, researchers visited 98 smoke shops, weed dispensaries and sex shops within the jurisdiction of a New York City poison center that had noted an increase in reports of poppers poisoning. They asked employees at the 86 stores that sold the drug for instructions on using it. Nearly half advised inhaling it, while 44% were unsure and 8% advised ingesting the fluid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying to use them,\u201d Palamar, who was not involved in this new study, said of poppers. \u201cBut if you do use them, do not drink them. It\u2019s not an energy drink. You\u2019ll definitely be poisoned.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance acknowledged Friday that Elon Musk has made \u201cmistakes\u201d in a wide-ranging interview with NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance acknowledged Friday that Elon Musk has made \u201cmistakes\u201d while executing mass firings of federal employees and emphasized that he believes there are \u201ca lot of good people who work in the government.\u201d",
      "\u201cElon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I\u2019m accepting of mistakes,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News.",
      "\u201cI also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I\u2019m also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government \u2014 a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s gentler tone represented a contrast from the chainsaw approach that Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has taken as he leads President Donald Trump\u2019s initiative to slash federal spending and reorient the federal bureaucracy. The firings of thousands of government employees has been the centerpiece of Musk\u2019s work over the first seven weeks of Trump\u2019s second White House administration, with the cuts yielding lawsuits and pushback from judges. Musk has broadly characterized federal workers as \"fraudsters\" who can\u2019t be trusted to do their jobs.",
      "\u201cI think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job,\u201d Vance said when asked about such comments from Musk. \u201cNow, how many people is that? I don\u2019t know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it\u2019s a few thousand or much larger than that.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people\u2019s business,\" he added. \"That doesn\u2019t distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don\u2019t want the person who doesn\u2019t show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s comments came during an exclusive and wide-ranging interview aboard Air Force Two, as the vice president and second lady Usha Vance returned from a visit to a plastics factory in Bay City, Michigan. His motorcade\u2019s ride into town illustrated how different life is now for him and his young family.",
      "Dozens of protesters had lined the street leading to the factory, greeting Vance and his traveling party with middle fingers and vulgar signs, one of which featured a crossed-out swastika and read \u201cGo home, scumbag.\u201d The previous night, Vance was booed while arriving for a performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington. And while walking with his 3-year-old daughter near their home in Ohio last weekend, Vance found himself in a civil but, in his description, upsetting conversation with pro-Ukraine demonstrators.",
      "\u201cThe thing at the Kennedy Center I thought was funny,\u201d Vance said aboard his plane Friday afternoon. \u201cThe thing by my house I thought was kind of annoying. I think you just kind of take the good with the bad. \u2026 I kind of just see it as, depending on your perspective, a feature or a bug of this new life.\u201d",
      "In his remarks at the factory, where he was welcomed by a friendlier, pro-Trump audience filled with local Republicans, Vance touted the administration\u2019s commitment to manufacturing and economic recovery while tempering expectations for the rapid turnaround that Trump promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A majority of respondents in two polls released this week \u2014 56% of adults surveyed by CNN, 54% of registered voters surveyed by Quinnipiac University \u2014 said they disapproved of how Trump is handling the economy.\u00a0Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on foreign products has ignited fears of a trade war that could raise consumer prices.",
      "\u201cNow I have to be honest with you,\u201d Vance said in Bay City. \u201cThe road ahead of us is long, but we are already, in just seven short weeks, starting to see early indications of the president\u2019s vision becoming our shared American reality.\u201d",
      "During the campaign, Vance frequently spoke of a woman he had met who said that she and her husband could no longer afford their weekly tradition of grilling steaks on Friday nights. Reminded of that story aboard his plane Friday, Vance described recent lower gas prices as a positive sign.",
      "Vance also acknowledged that \u201cyou already see things leveling off to, not an ideal situation, but a much better and more significant improvement\u201d while casting blame on former President Joe Biden, whose policies he said had left Trump in a hole.",
      "\u201cMy ambition is that we see some pretty quick results, that you start to see at least a pathway towards financial stability,\u201d said Vance, specifically noting 10,000 manufacturing jobs added last month. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see progress. I think it\u2019s going to be incremental progress. But I also think it\u2019s important to be honest with people that you don\u2019t get to $2 trillion deficits overnight. You\u2019re not going to get out of $2 trillion deficits overnight.\u201d",
      "Vance also discussed his early role in shaping and articulating Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda, from a provocative speech at last month\u2019s Munich Security Conference to an extraordinary Oval Office clash two weeks ago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Vance had accused of being insufficiently thankful for U.S. aid.",
      "\u201cI just try not to be overly scripted,\u201d Vance said before recalling his speech in Munich, which upbraided European leaders over issues such as free speech and mass migration. \u201cThe classic thing to do in Munich would have been to show up and give a speech about NATO or give a speech about where the Ukraine-Russia thing was at that moment in time, and just sort of thought to myself, like, 'What is it that I think is really important to say?' And the president was OK with me saying it, so I said it.\u201d",
      "Vance added that he doesn\u2019t \u201cgo into these things trying to be like a spokesman for the administration. Some of that happens naturally, but fundamentally, the president is the spokesman for the administration, and everything flows from there. I try to do a good job. I try to say things both that I think are true but also are in accordance with the president\u2019s preferences. And let the chips fall where they may.\u201d",
      "Trump, who is constitutionally barred from serving another term, raised eyebrows in a Fox News interview last month by saying it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to anoint Vance as his successor in 2028. Vance and others close to Trump have since brushed off the question and Trump\u2019s answer to it, agreeing that such talk was premature.",
      "Asked a variation of the question Friday \u2014 does he view himself as Trump\u2019s successor? \u2014 Vance replied that he\u2019s not thinking about a presidential campaign at the moment. He related the story of how he felt on Election Night, when, surrounded by his closest friends and family, it became clear he had won the vice presidency.",
      "\u201cWow, I\u2019m the vice president-elect of the United States,\u201d Vance recalled thinking. \u201cAnd, you know, if I never go further in politics, I\u2019m totally fine with that, but we get a really good opportunity to do a lot of really good s--- the next four years.\"",
      "\u201cIf I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself. \u2026 Now, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe,\" he added.",
      "\u201cI mean, man, if I was like a central figure to getting the Russia-Ukraine crisis solved, who gives a s--- what I do after this?\" Vance said. \"That\u2019s kind of the attitude I take. So I\u2019m very focused on doing a good job.\u201d"

      "Happy Friday! A government shutdown will be avoided, but the Democratic infighting has only just begun. Kristen Welker examines how tensions boiled over this week within the party.

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Shutdown showdown underscores deep divide in Democratic Party",
      "With just hours to spare before a midnight deadline, the Senate passed a Republican stopgap funding bill to keep the government open after days of indications from Democrats that a shutdown may be looming.",
      "The vote was 54-46, with two members of the Democratic caucus joining all but one Republican in support, sending the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk for a signature. But prior to final passage, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and nine other Democrats helped the measure clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle in the GOP-controlled chamber.",
      "It was that decision that has stoked deep divisions with the Democratic Party, which is facing a reckoning over how to respond to Trump.",
      "Tensions boiled over after Schumer first announced on Thursday he would vote in favor of advancing the GOP spending bill, despite Democratic fears that the measure passed by the House would enable Trump and Elon Musk to further lay off government workers and seek to eliminate programs without congressional input.",
      "But Schumer took to the Senate floor again this morning and argued that shutting down the government would only embolden Trump and Musk.",
      "\u201cMusk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIn other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction.\u201d",
      "Trump praised Schumer on Truth Social, calling his announcement a \u201creally good and smart move\u201d that took \u201cguts and courage.\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California responded to the president\u2019s post: \u201cWhen Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, \u2018You\u2019re doing the right things Senate Democrats,\u2019 we don\u2019t feel that is the right place to be.\u201d",
      "The reaction from Democrats has been furious. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leading progressive opposed to the bill, called Schumer\u2019s move \u201cdevastating\u201d and a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d",
      "In a stunning move, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on Democratic senators to reject the bill, defying Schumer. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., declined in a press conference to answer whether it\u2019s time for new leadership in the Senate.",
      "I\u2019ve been speaking to a number of Democratic sources, and while some were relieved by Schumer\u2019s move, one congressional aide told me to expect \u201csevere\u201d blowback from the base. The aide also noted the divide seems to be falling largely along generational lines, with some of the newest voices in the Senate being some of the staunchest opponents to Schumer\u2019s strategy.",
      "Why the backlash? Well, one, a number of vulnerable House Democrats in Trump districts opposed the bill earlier this week, and now feel like they took a tough vote for no reason. Second, some Democrats feel as though keeping the government open is basically giving Trump and Musk a green light to move forward with their deep cuts. And third, perhaps most importantly, many in the party saw this fight as the best opportunity to register their opposition to Trump. The question is: If not now, when?",
      "The episode has been a real test of Schumer\u2019s leadership at a critical moment when Democrats are still trying to find their footing. And it all underscores that there is a deep divide in the party about the best way to take on Trump in the opening months of his second administration.",
      "We\u2019ll get our first real sense of how voters are reacting to all of the moves out of Washington in our new NBC News poll, which Steve Kornacki will debut on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday. Plus, I\u2019ll talk to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.",

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who had been investigated by the Justice Department in connection with allegations of sex trafficking \u2014 he denied the allegations and the DOJ decided not to bring charges \u2014 was seen as someone chosen because he would do whatever Trump asked, regardless of the ethics or law.",
      "Bondi was seen as a professional with deep legal experience: She had served as Florida\u2019s attorney general for 10 years. It was true that she had served as one of Trump\u2019s lawyers during his first impeachment trial and supported his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Still, Democrats and Republicans who knew her believed she was someone who\u2019d stand up to Trump in a way Gaetz wouldn\u2019t and refuse if the president asked her to do anything illegal or improper.",
      "But since Bondi took the reins, the Justice Department has been operating in a manner dramatically at odds with how it has been run in the 50 years since Attorney General John Mitchell was sent to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.",
      "Vowing to end the politicization she says occurred during the Biden administration, Bondi has implemented her own regime of politicization, critics say. The Trump administration, with Bondi\u2019s help, appears to be seeking to transform the Justice Department into a political instrument of the president \u2014 something that no Republican or Democratic administration has done since Richard Nixon.",

      "Federal wildland firefighters secured a permanent pay raise Friday after years of waiting for Congress to answer their plea.",
      "Included in the spending bill approved by Congress is a new pay scale and incident-response premium pay, which would apply to employees assigned to active fires.",
      "The bill next goes to President Donald Trump to sign into law.",
      "The new pay scale means firefighters will keep their temporary pay raises of either $20,000 annually or 50% of their base salary, enacted in 2021 under the Biden administration.",
      "Firefighters will not be eligible for premium pay for fires contained within 36 hours. The pay will be calculated at 450% of their hourly base rate for each day a firefighter is on an active fire and will be limited to a total of $9,000 in any calendar year.",
      "This marks the first time federal firefighters will get paid for the hours they rest and sleep while away from home, which is standard practice in most municipal and state departments.",
      "\u201cFor years, our union and NFFE members have fought tirelessly for a lasting pay solution for federal wildland firefighters,\u201d Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees union, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cNow, that fight is paying off,\u201d he added. \u201cA permanent pay fix means we can shift our focus to addressing other critical issues \u2014 recruitment and retention, housing, mental health benefits, rest and recuperation, and the overall well-being of our nation\u2019s wildland firefighting workforce.\u201d",
      "The pay bump comes as federal firefighters recover from cuts to their ranks after the Agriculture Department, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service, reinstated more than 5,000 probationary employees who had been fired in February. At least 2,000 of them had primary or secondary firefighting duties, according to the NFFE.",
      "The order to reinstate the employees earlier this week originated from a federal civil service board ruling, which found the mass firings\u00a0may have been unlawful. The ruling directed the USDA to restore employees to their jobs for at least 45 days with back pay.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in California ordered more departments - including Veterans Affairs, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury - to\u00a0reinstate thousands of probationary employees who were terminated in February.",
      "But what comes next is unclear. The Trump administration set a March 13 deadline for all federal agencies to submit reorganization plans to initiate \u201clarge-scale reductions in force.\u201d",
      "Those cuts could include federal firefighters.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect it to be this way,\u201d said Steve Gutierrez, an NFFE union representative. \u201cI\u2019d love to celebrate, but I don\u2019t want to do it if people are still losing their jobs and and these guys might get cut loose later on.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty has already taken its toll on the Forest Service. Last month, Chief Randy Moore, the first Black man to take the helm, resigned after more than 45 years with the Forest Service. In his retirement note to staff, Moore said he felt the full burden of current political tides.",
      "\u201cIf you are feeling uncertainty, frustration, or loss, you are not alone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese are real and valid emotions that I am feeling, too.\u201d",
      "The resignations continued this week when top foresters who oversaw forests in California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota stepped down effective March 28, according to the NFFE.",
      "The forest supervisor of the Angeles National Forest, which was recently battered by the deadly Eaton Fire, also resigned."

    "story": [
      "As voters returned Donald Trump to the White House in November, many had the economy top of mind. Candidate Trump vowed to bring down prices right away and foresaw boom times for the market.",
      "That\u2019s not the case nearly two months into the administration, however.",
      "Instead, markets turned south this week amid a slew of data showing the economy looking increasingly precarious \u2014 with federal cuts led by Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE group heightening worries about the state of the job market and tariff threats adding to cost worries for inflation-weary shoppers.",
      "On Thursday, the S&P 500 benchmark plunged into correction territory, meaning it closed 10% below its most recent highs. It was its fourth negative week in a row \u2014 the time since such a streak occurred was last summer.",
      "The decline came as Trump ramped up his tariffs strategy, allowing duties on steel and aluminum to come into effect \u2014 and incurring retaliatory tariffs \u2014 while continuing to threaten higher levies on Canadian goods and bringing new tariff warnings for European champagne and wine imports.",
      "Stock prices largely reflect expectations about future earnings. And CEOs and analysts alike are suggesting U.S. consumers are undergoing a major reorientation of their outlook.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s just a bit of an uncertain world out there right now,\u201d Ed Stack, the chairman of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, told CNBC this week when asked about the company\u2019s expectation that its profits will be lower this year. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen from a tariff standpoint? You know, if tariffs are put in place and prices rise the way that they might, what\u2019s going to happen with the consumer?\u201d",
      "On Friday, the University of Michigan reported the year-ahead outlook business conditions fell to its lowest level ever. The survey\u2019s readings for future inflation and unemployment, meanwhile, surged.",
      "Those results are part of a broader trend. The New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations, released Monday, showed \u201cnotably\u201d worsening outlooks for unemployment, consumers\u2019 ability to make minimum debt payments, and credit access expectations, while the outlook for stocks a year from now fell to its lowest level since December 2023.",
      "The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), which tends to lean more conservative, reported this week that its uncertainty index climbed to its second-highest recorded reading last month.",
      "\u201cUncertainty is high and rising on Main Street, and for many reasons,\u201d said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg in a statement. \u201cThose small business owners expecting better business conditions in the next six months dropped and the percent viewing the current period as a good time to expand fell, but remains well above where it was in the fall. Inflation remains a major problem, ranked second behind the top problem, labor quality.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the worsening outlook. But the president is showing no sign of abandoning his tariffs strategy, while members of his administration are now actively preparing the electorate for a potential downturn.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this week that a recession would be \u201cworth it\u201d in order to get Trump\u2019s economic policies in place while adding that it would be \u201cBiden\u2019s economy\u201d until the fourth quarter. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said trade policy uncertainty would be \u201cresolved\u201d in early April and that the economy would \u201ctake off\u201d in the second quarter.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the economy needed to \u201cdetox\u201d from its supposed reliance on public spending, though he stated in a subsequent interview that he did not envision a recession.",
      "Trump himself has said the economy is in \u201ctransition.\u201d",
      "Still others in the conservative information ecosystem are trying to paint the weakening as \u201caccomplishments,\u201d pointing to falling mortgage rates and some daylight on consumer prices.",
      "It is true that gas prices are down, as are egg prices, while mortgage rates are falling. Yet some experts say those developments are occurring against a backdrop of weakening overall demand and fears about economic growth, as consumers begin to process that this is not the economy they signed up for.",
      "\u201cMany consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors; frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one\u2019s policy preferences,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan survey, said in a statement.",
      "Bloomberg News reported that 48% of the survey\u2019s respondents spontaneously mentioned tariffs during interviews with the university, and that the duties were expected to generate substantial upward pressure for inflation in the future.",
      "In a note to clients Friday, JP Morgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli lowered his estimate for U.S. growth for the year, while forecasting unemployment would now climb to as much as 4.4%.",
      "\u201cHeightened trade policy uncertainty should weigh on activity growth, particularly for capital spending,\u201d he said. The tariffs Trump has made good on imposing, meanwhile, are set to \u201ccreate a bump to headline inflation and a corresponding drag on consumer purchasing power,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cLast week we held off on revising our economic forecast as we awaited greater clarity on trade policy,\u201d Feroli\u00a0wrote. \u201cIn hindsight, we could end up waiting a very long time.\u201d"

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Friday she has ordered an investigation into \u201cpolitically motivated leaks\u201d from inside the intelligence community and is also probing internal chat rooms for any misconduct by employees.",
      "\u201cPolitically motivated leaks undermine our national security and the trust of the American people and will not be tolerated,\u201d Gabbard said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, such leaks have become commonplace with no investigation or accountability. That ends now. We know of and are aggressively pursuing recent leakers from within the Intelligence Community and will hold them accountable.\u201d",
      "In a series of\u00a0posts\u00a0on X, Gabbard listed what she said were recent examples of unauthorized leaks from sources in the intelligence community.\u00a0She referred to news reports  \u2014 on topics including Israel, Iran and the U.S.-Russia relationship \u2014 by HuffPost, The Washington Post, NBC News and The Record news site.\u00a0But she did not specify precisely which stories she believes were based on leaks or when they were published or broadcast.",
      "\u201cAny unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such,\u201d Gabbard wrote.",
      "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his administration referred more media leaks for criminal investigation each year than in any of the previous 15 years, according to\u00a0records released\u00a0in 2021 by the Justice Department to the independent watchdog group, Project on Government Oversight, in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.",
      "The Trump administration also sought\u00a0to obtain communications records\u00a0of reporters from CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, as part of leak investigation efforts in Trump\u2019s first presidential term.",
      "When she took over as the top-ranking intelligence official last month, Gabbard said she planned to restore trust in the intelligence agencies, arguing that the spy services had been misused as political weapons against Trump.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s statement on investigating leaks comes after senators grilled her at her confirmation hearing over her 2020 comments praising Edward Snowden, who leaked a vast trove of secrets about the National Security Agency\u2019s electronic eavesdropping operations.",
      "U.S. prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage. Snowden fled to Russia, where authorities have refused to extradite him.",
      "Gabbard had praised Snowden as a courageous whistleblower for exposing extensive eavesdropping by U.S. spy agencies and suggested he should be pardoned. But at her Senate confirmation hearing in January, Gabbard revised her stance, saying she would not seek a pardon for Snowden and that he \u201cbroke the law.\u201d However, she sidestepped questions as to whether she believed he was a traitor.",
      "Apart from probing leaks, Gabbard said Friday she was also launching an investigation into any misconduct or unprofessional behavior on internal chat rooms within intelligence agencies.",
      "Last month, Gabbard fired more than 100 intelligence officers from 15 agencies, saying they used an internal government chat platform for discussions that included topics like polyamory, gender transition surgery and politics.",
      "She said that the fired officers\u2019 conduct represented \u201can egregious violation of trust\u201d and violated \u201cbasic rules and standards around professionalism.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump defended his allies Friday while calling for his perceived political opponents to be jailed during a speech at the headquarters of the Justice Department \u2014 an agency that was prosecuting him just months ago.",
      "Trump called U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who helped dismiss his classified documents case, a \u201cbrilliant\u201d judge, while condemning \u201chorrible human beings\u201d whom he accused of disparaging Cannon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally illegal what they do. I just hope you can all watch for it, but it\u2019s totally illegal, and it was so unfair what they were doing to her,\u201d Trump said.",
      "After deeming the United States\u2019 withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 as \u201cthe most humiliating time in this history of our country,\u201d Trump called for the people behind the decision, officials from the Biden administration, to be imprisoned.",
      "\u201cThe people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said he would \u201cinsist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "Calling former special counsel Jack Smith \u201cderanged,\u201d Trump referred to the hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants he pardoned on his first day in office as \u201chostages\u201d and said the Justice Department would not return to what he declared as an era of weaponization.",
      "\u201cThose days are over, and they are never going to come back,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump was indicted in two separate federal cases: one involving his handling of classified documents, and another involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The cases were dismissed after the 2024 election, and career prosecutors who had worked on Smith\u2019s team were fired when Trump took office, as were numerous federal prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases.",
      "Trump\u2019s remarks are not the first time he has called to imprison his political opponents. But the venue of his speech \u2014 delivering the remarks at the Justice Department to a room full of its top officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 demonstrates how his previous campaign threats of vengeance and retribution have taken on significantly higher stakes now that he wields the enormous power of the presidency.",
      "Trump noted the significance of his remarks at the Justice Department, on Friday becoming the third president this century to deliver a speech at the agency\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cI was asked to do it, and I said, \u2018Is it appropriate that I do it?\u2019 And then I realized it\u2019s not only appropriate, I think it\u2019s really important, and I may never do it again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI may never have another chance to do it again, because this is something that I\u2019m leaving to the greatest people I know, the best people, the smartest people, the toughest people I know, and they\u2019re going to do an incredible job.\u201d",
      "When Trump finished his speech, a mainstay of his campaign rallies, the song \u201cY.M.C.A.,\u201d played over the speakers inside the Justice Department\u2019s Great Hall."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-administration-cuts-cuban-human-rights-groups-funding-rcna196504",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:23:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The cuts have shocked pro-democracy groups that monitor prisoners in Cuba, which have been the sole providers of information about political prisoners, including their health conditions.",
    "story": [
      "When Cuba announced in January it would begin releasing 553 political prisoners as a plan negotiated with the Vatican \u2014 which also included removing Cuba from the states sponsors of terrorism list \u2014 the U.S. based human rights organization Cubalex went straight to work.",
      "In the absence of an official list of prisoners or announcements by the communist-run government, groups like Cubalex used a database put together years ago to contact relatives of prisoners on the island and be able to confirm who has been freed.",
      "The group, which monitors political prisoners on the island and has long been a source for news outlets and rights groups, felt the impact when the U.S. withheld $239 million in congressional appropriations to the nonprofit National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in late January. For instance, a two-year project that was supposed to launch in February to provide legal help for political prisoners and document human rights violations in Cuba was abruptly cancelled and Cubalex was forced to lay off 10 of their 26 staff.",
      "\u201cIt has been a hard blow,\u201d said Laritza Diversent, who founded Cubalex in 2010. She and 10 other members were forced into exile in 2017, she said, after being threatened with jail for their activism. \u201cAt first it was a profound shock ... but I\u2019m determined to forge ahead.\u201d",
      "Pro-democracy groups that monitor prisoners in Cuba have had their funding cut at a critical time, as the Trump administration continues to withhold tens of millions of dollars in funding from NED, which has longstanding bipartisan support to promote democracy overseas. Recently, following a lawsuit against the U.S. government, part of the funds were restored. But many projects on Cuba have been\u00a0 hard-hit. The funds cuts have sent shock waves among the small groups that depend on NED, and for years have been the sole providers of information about the circumstances surrounding political prisoners, including their health conditions.",
      "Another organization that tracks political prisoners in Cuba with staff in the U.S. and overseas said the elimination of NED funds has had a \u201cstrong impact\u201d on the group. The founder spoke on condition of anonymity because they collaborate with activists on the island who are often targets of the government. In recent weeks, the group held a meeting and announced there were no longer funds available to continue working. Three of the 12 staffers are now helping on a voluntary basis.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frustrated and afraid, but I\u2019m trying not to let those feelings take over,\u201d the founder said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m starting all over again. I\u2019m going to continue dedicating time and energy to the organization because I can\u2019t allow everything we\u2019ve done to die.\u201d",
      "A NED employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly said that while NED recently regained partial access to its congressionally appropriated funds, operations on the island have not been able to resume completely.",
      "The employee said NED is in the process of resuming the disbursement of grants to the extent possible under current constraints.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, one of the best-known dissidents and human rights activists in Cuba, has called for donations for political prisoners on social media. He was released from prison in January as part of the Biden administration\u2019s plan to release 553 prisoners. Like the others, he was arrested on July 11, 2021, as he was on his way to join historic, islandwide protests.",
      "Ferrer asked for Cuban exiles to donate money to cover costs associated with cellphone usage, so \u201cpolitical prisoners can communicate with their relatives who receive the calls on their mobiles.\u201d",
      "A State Department spokesperson said, \u201cAs we continue to review federal assistance programs, we will identify how to best align U.S. government resources to support the Administration\u2019s priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who repress their own people and plunder resources for their own gain will be accountable for their actions,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Cuba\u2019s government did not respond to a request for comment. But the island\u2019s government has long accused the U.S. of funding activists on the island as an attempt at regime change. Government officials have labeled dissidents who receive U.S. funding, whether from NED or the U.S. Agency for International Development, as \u201cmercenaries.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez recently posted on X that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has \u201cmutated from being the main instigator, political blackmailer, and lobbyist ... in favor of #USAID funds and the State Department for subversion in #Cuba, to cutting those budgets and defending an alien foreign policy.\u201d",
      "Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, has always advocated a hard-line policy against the Cuban government. As secretary of state, he has taken steps to restrict visa issuance to those involved in Cuba\u2019s international medical program, as an example.",
      "\u201cWe will promote accountability for the Cuban regime for oppressing its people and those who profit from it,\u201d he wrote on X. Rubio has not publicly commented on NED or USAID cuts to Cuban human rights groups."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead Medicare and Medicaid, on Friday sidestepped several questions from senators about whether he supports a House budget resolution that could lead to significant cuts to Medicaid.",
      "The budget plan, adopted by House Republicans late last month, directs the Energy and Commerce Committee to identify at least $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts over the next 10 years, the majority of which is expected to come from the health program.",
      "Oz, a former surgeon and TV personality, pledged during his Senate confirmation hearing to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to fight waste, fraud and abuse in the health care system \u2014 an argument being used by some Republicans to defend the possible cuts.",
      "However, he made no commitments to protect Medicaid funding.",
      "\u201cI want to make sure that the patients today and in the future have resources to protect them if they get ill,\u201d Oz said. \u201cThe way you protect Medicaid is by making sure that it\u2019s viable at every level.\u201d",
      "As CMS administrator, Oz would oversee Medicaid, as well as Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Together, the programs provide health insurance for roughly half the U.S. population.",
      "Medicaid provides health coverage primarily to people with low incomes, although it covers other groups, including some older adults, pregnant women and people with disabilities.",
      "It's one of the largest sources of federal spending, costing more than $600 billion per year, according to government data.",
      "Oz's lack of commitment to opposing the possible Medicaid cuts appeared to frustrate a number of Democratic senators, with some noting that the cuts would directly impact patients in their states.",
      "\u201cAll\u00a0my colleagues are going to want to know: Are you going to cut Medicaid?\" Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash, said. \u201cWe want to know that from everybody.\u201d",
      "In a back-and-forth exchange on the cuts, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., asked Oz how many children losing health insurance would be \"acceptable\" to him. (In 2023, Medicaid covered nearly 4 in 10 children, including over 8 in 10 children in poverty.)",
      "\"I don\u2019t want children losing health insurance,\" Oz responded.",
      "Hassan then quipped, \"Well, then you\u2019re going to need to reject the Republican budget plan.\"",
      "Oz seemed to suggest that Medicaid funds weren't being used efficiently, saying that the program \"is the No. 1 expense item in most states.\"",
      "He also said he supports Medicaid work requirements but added that he was open to alternative qualifications, such as enrollment in an educational program.",
      "\"We have to make the system better,\" he said.",
      "His controversial endorsements of marketed health products, such as the unproven weight loss supplement green coffee extract, received little attention at the hearing.",
      "Oz spent a lot of time during the hearing talking about artificial intelligence \u2014 a shared priority of the Trump administration \u2014 and how it might be used to fight misuse of prior authorization.",
      "Prior authorization is a tool used by health insurance companies that requires doctors and patients to get pre-approval to use certain treatments. Insurers say it helps control costs, weeding out unnecessary care. Patients say it delays the care they need, as approvals can take weeks.",
      "Oz said he wants the prior authorization process to be as quick as a credit card transaction.",
      "\"A credit card approval doesn't take you three months,\" Oz said. \"You know immediately whether the transactions are approved or not.\"",
      "\"I believe we have the power right now with the technology that didn't exist three or four years ago,\" he added.",
      "In response to questions, he also criticized Medicare Advantage \u2014 a type of health plan provided by private insurance companies \u2014\u00a0over concerns that insurers could be using a tactic called \"upcoding,\" where they jack up government reimbursements to boost their revenue.",
      "The remarks were notable, as Oz has previously advocated for privatizing Medicare and promoted a number of insurers under Medicare Advantage.",
      "\"If confirmed, I will go after it,\" Oz said, referring to Medicare Advantage."

      "\"The Electric State,\" which premiered on Netflix on March 14, takes a new spin on the age-old tale of robots taking over.",
      "This time, robots lose the war and are an oppressed class.",
      "To understand the film, which was inspired by a 2018 graphic novel, you need to understand the world's history. Humans invented robots and put them to work doing manual labor and service jobs. Eventually, the robots rebelled and started the Robots Rights' Movement, led by a robot version of Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson). During the Clinton Administration, a deadly war broke out between the humans and the robots.",
      "Technology mogul Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci) developed Neurocasters, a technology one puts on their head (like VR) which links the human mind to mechanized drone bodies. Neurocasters split your consciousness, a la \"Severance.\" One version of a human can be in a drone body working, while the other version is having fun in the human's original body.",
      "Once humans developed this new technology, they defeated the Robot Equality Coalition, banishing all the robots to Sentre's Exclusion Zone (known as The EX).",
      "Stanley Tucci explained on TODAY March 12 that Neurocasters were \u201coriginally sort of designed to sort of ease people\u2019s pain and suffering, but it\u2019s gotten out of hand.\u201d",
      "\"The Electric State,\" directed by the Russo brothers, takes place in the aftermath of this war in 1994, following Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown) as she races across the country to find her genius brother, Christopher, whom she had previously thought died in a car crash along with their parents.",
      "Accompanying her is a robot named Cosmo (Alan Tudyk). Although he can not fully speak, Cosmo conveys that Christopher is alive and projecting his own consciousness into Cosmo.",
      "Eventually, she teams up with Keats (Chris Pratt) and his own robot friend Herman (Anthony Mackie). Together, the foursome journeys through The EX to find Christopher.",
      "Along the way, they find Dr. Amherst (Ke Huy Quan) who informs them that Christopher is actually the reason that the Neurocasters exist. In fact, Christopher's brain is such a marvel, that in his comatose state after the car accident, his brain was strong enough to power \u2014 and still powers \u2014 all of Sentre's (Ethan Skate's company) technology.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many elements of animation, it\u2019s a massive, epic scope and scale, but really rooted in humanity,\u201d Chris Pratt said on TODAY Oct. 17. \u201cAnd that relationship between these two folks is a big part of that.\u201d",
      "Throughout the film, Michelle befriends many more robots who are voiced by big names like Woody Harrelson, Jenny Slate, Brian Cox and Hank Azaria.",
      "All the while she's on the run from Col. Bradbury (Giancarlo Esposito), a leader in the uprising and now a bounty hunter catching robots (Coleman Domingo also makes a cameo here as a soldier within Bradbury's ranks).",
      "The sci-fi/adventure film ends similar to how the world's history began: a huge battle between humans and robots, but this time the viewer is rooting for the robots. Read on the understand why and what happens.",
      "'The Electric State' ending explained",
      "During a battle in The EX, Col. Bradbury successfully kidnaps Cosmo. He gets ready to fly him back to Sentre when the drone that Ethan is Neurocasting into kills Dr. Amherst. Col. Bradbury still brings Cosmo back to Sentre, but face-to-face, he tells Ethan that he's crossed a line by killing someone and lying to him.",
      "Ethan doesn't care as he has Christopher's essence back, meaning his company won't completely crumble and instead is back at functioning capacity.",
      "This is when Michelle, her friends and a bunch of robots from The EX begin their attack on Sentre's headquarters with the mission of freeing Christopher.",
      "Amherst's computer, which stores all his knowledge, had revealed that removing Christopher's brain from the system would free him and cause a complete system failure for Sentre.",
      "Keats and Herman start the first wave of the attack, launching cars into Sentre's headquarters. Ethan deploys his entire security squad to stop their attack. Michelle, meanwhile, sneaks into Sentre through a backdoor using the code she'd secured.",
      "The second wave of robots then attack Sentre, coming to Keats and Herman's aid and launching a full on war against Ethan's security forces, who are Neurocasting into drones.",
      "Michelle reaches the room holding Christopher. She discovers that she has to put on a Neurocaster and go inside Christopher's mind to speak to him.",
      "While inside, Christopher confirms that if his brain is removed from the system, Sentre dies \u2014 but his physical body cannot survive without Sentre. He tells Michelle that she needs to be the one to save the world from Sentre, meaning that she must kill her own brother.",
      "While Michelle grapples with this realization, unsure of what to do, Ethan fires up his own Neurocaster, which is connected to a giant, lethal drone. He steps into battle in the suit and immediately begins destroying the robots.",
      "Separately on the battle field, Col. Bradbury confronts Mr. Peanut, but instead of fighting him as he had the entire film, he admits he was wrong and tells Mr. Peanut what room and floor Ethan's real body is located on. Col. Bradbury then exits the battle.",
      "Keats and Herman fight Ethan in his drone suit. They defeat him, but Herman dies in the process. As the real Ethan is taking his Neurocaster off, he's confronted by Mr. Peanut inside Sentre to renegotiate the treaty.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelle is still talking to Christopher, unwilling to let him die. Then he tells her that Sentre has put tighter controls over him this time and he doesn't want to live like this forever. Sentre could keep him alive for 100 years. Michelle sayas she doesn't want to lose him again.",
      "\"You can't lose me,\" Christopher tells her. \"But you can lose them. You. You're the one whose gonna change the world.\"",
      "After a final cry, hug, and exchanging of \"I love you's,\" Michelle leaves, pressing three buttons that kill her younger brother. She holds Cosmo's hand and Christopher's chest in both her hands.",
      "The timing is impeccable as Keats is about to be killed by a drone, but all of Sentre's technology ceases to work before the fatal strike.",
      "Despite Christopher dying, there's a happiness to the battle as Herman emerges alive and well after Keats bears his soul to what he believed to be his lifeless friend.",
      "What follows is a montage of Sentre shutting down across the world and news emerging that the company had been experimenting on a little boy to stay afloat. Ethan Skate gets arrested in the aftermath. The media montage ends with a reporter saying, \"You know who I want to talk about? The girl who trucked a ton of bots to Seattle to kick Skate's butt.\"",
      "Cut to Michelle, who films a video for the world saying that the technology Sentre made was bad for everyone, not just robots.",
      "\"I know the war happened and things fell apart and life really sucked,\" she says. \"And maybe for a little while the Neurocasters helped you forget that. We got so used to it that we thought that\u2019s what real life was. But it\u2019s not. Real life, it\u2019s contact. It\u2019s you and me. We\u2019re flesh and bone, yeah, but we\u2019re also electricity. And when we hug and laugh and hold hands and argue, my particles stay with you and yours stay with me. And maybe we stay together forever. But that can\u2019t happen if you close yourself off.\"",
      "Michelle continues on, saying humanity needs to start over. She tells everyone that they need to stick together and help each other to make it work.",
      "\"Look around,\" she says. \"There\u2019s someone near you right now. They\u2019re real and alive. And they need you as much as you need them. And if there isn\u2019t, if you don\u2019t have anyone, then come find us. Because we\u2019re starting over. We\u2019re going to do it right this time.\u201d",
      "What does that last scene mean? Is Christopher alive?",
      "With Michelle saving the world like Christopher had instructed her to do, the movie could end \u2014\u00a0but instead it tacks on one last scene.",
      "Cosmo, the robot Christopher had transferred some of his essence into, is dumped into what looks to be a pile of trash. Nearby, a stray dog laps water from a puddle.",
      "The final shot shows the reflection in the water as Cosmo rises up, hinting that some of Christopher's essence may still be alive within him."

      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Black Bag.\"",
      "\"Black Bag,\" which hits theaters March 14, has all the themes a compelling spy thriller should: secrets, love, betrayal and, of course, some killer outfits (no pun intended).",
      "Directed by Stephen Soderbergh, the film follows George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender) as he tries to find a mole within his own agency \u2014 the National Cyber Security Center in London.",
      "Unfortunately for him, the prime suspect seems to be his wife Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett) who also works at the NCSC.",
      "At issue is a secretive software program called Severus, which has been stolen from the NCSC by a mole within the agency. Apparently, the mole is working on a sale with terrorists to give them Severus, which would cause the death of thousands and topple current global power balances. George has one week to figure out who the mole is.",
      "George, who is known for his interrogation skills with a lie detector, spends the film investigating agents who could be possible moles: recently promoted young star Col. James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page), lothario Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke), Freddie's girlfriend and technology expert Clarissa Dubose (Marisa Abela) and therapist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris), who is dating James.",
      "George, who turned his own father in for wrongdoing in the past, also secretly investigates Kathryn as the clues continue to point towards her. This, however, proves to be a testament to his love.",
      "\"I watch her, I assume she watches me. If she's in trouble, even of her own making, I will do everything in my power to extricate her,\" George says in the film.",
      "Yet as he continues to investigate Kathryn, she answers too many of his questions with two simple words: \"Black bag.\"",
      "For those who need a spy lingo refresh, \u201cblack bag\u201d is a term used to convey that an operation or a piece of information is top secret and the speaker cannot say more.",
      "\"It comes from the tradition of spies putting their documents into a black bag and once that black bag is locked, no one can know what's in it,\" Cate Blanchett told TODAY on March 10. \"So in order for their marriage to function, when they go on separate operations, when they ask one another details, they say 'Sorry, black bag.'\"",
      "After many twists and turns, the traitorous reveal of who the mole truly is comes amid of a flurry of chaos and confusion.",
      "Here's the final dinner party scene broken down and all your questions answered.",
      "'Black Bag' ending explained",
      "For a spy movie, \"Black Bag\" had very few physical action scenes, instead relying on psychologically thrilling turns of events to propel the plot.",
      "As Reg\u00e9-Jean Page told TODAY on March 7, it's a \"super taut psychological thriller.\"",
      "Two of the most tense scenes in the film are dinner parties hosted by George and Kathryn with all the potential moles invited \u2014 which Blanchett described on TODAY as \"quite theatrical\" scenes.",
      "While the first dinner party included a nice meal (dosed with a narcotic that functioned as truth serum, of course) and a side of dramatics (like a hand stabbing), the second dinner party skipped the meal all together, cutting straight to the chase: a game.",
      "George sets a gun on the table, announcing that everyone will play a game as Dr. Vaughan realizes that the couple has changed their carpet to easily dispose of a body if needed.",
      "In typical George fashion, this game will be potentially deadly and meant to expose plenty of secrets. Through careful questions and accusations, George gets everyone to admit to something.",
      "Dr. Vaughan has been secretly sleeping with Freddie as she thought she might need something from him. During this affair, Freddie told her about the cameras being redirected \u2014 which was one of the biggest clues that pointed towards Kathryn being the mole.",
      "However, going into the dinner party, George has already discovered that someone within the agency is framing Kathryn.",
      "The big reveal comes when it's discovered that it wasn't terrorists who initiated the idea to steal Severus, it was an agency worker.",
      "James has been the one working to sell Severus. James did so by putting the program on a hard drive that he stored in a red soccer ball keychain which he\u2019d been seen with throughout the film. James reveals that his boss Arthur Stieglitz (Pierce Brosnan) was the one who suggested the idea.",
      "But then the second twist happens. There were two plans running amok during the movie. James had one plan, while Freddie had another.",
      "James worked to sell Severus to the terrorists, while separately  Freddie was trying to frame George and Kathryn for the crime.",
      "George then reveals photos of James selling Severus. With no way out, James grabs the gun from the middle of the table and says he did it to end the war. He also admits to killing Philip Meacham, an agent and friend of George who was murdered earlier, to cover up his crimes.",
      "James then points the gun at George, narrowing in on his target. But George doesn't flinch. Instead he says that a camera has been filming them this whole time.",
      "But this fact doesn't deter James. He tries to shoot George, but the gun doesn't work. Before James can do anything else, Kathryn pulls a second gun out and shoots James in the head, immediately killing him.",
      "This action proves a point George and Kathryn had been reciting to each other the whole film: they would kill for each other. Blanchett echoed that point on TODAY, telling Savannah Guthrie they would \"literally kill for each other.\"",
      "The rest of the film ties up loose ends smoothly. The couple wraps James' body into the new carpet they'd placed beneath the table. George then dumps James' body into the secluded lake he goes fishing in.",
      "The film then flashes forward to Monday at work. Kathryn tells Arthur that he needs to step away from his position.",
      "He tells her he will leave his job \"feet first,\" to which she responds, \"Anyway you like.\"",
      "There's just one lose end to wrap up by this point. Where did the 7 million pounds go that was transferred about throughout all the chaos?",
      "Well, during a passionate makeout scene, George tells Kathryn the money is in a Swiss bank account that they have access to.",
      "The end leaves viewers with George and Kathryn kissing, perhaps paying homage to the film's message: it's more than just a spy movie. It's a tale about the mysteries of marriage and the lengths of love."

    "story": [
      "Nicholas Baxter\u2019s usual moral balance involves the scales of justice at work in the district attorney\u2019s office each week, but what happens when that delicate equilibrium tips over into his life at home?",
      "It means things get \u201cfun and kind of messy,\u201d according to Tony Goldwyn, who has portrayed DA Baxter on \u201cLaw & Order\u201d since the character\u2019s introduction in March 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those episodes of \u2018Law & Order\u2019 that has a lot of dimension to it,\u201d he explains in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "In the March 13 episode, \u201cCrossing Lines,\u201d James Powers, the son of a senator, is found dead. Julia Gallow, a journalist working on a hit piece about Powers, quickly draws suspicion. Baxter recuses himself from the case after the defense attorney he\u2019s dating, Kate Norris (Maggie Siff), signs on to represent Gallow.",
      "Baxter tells Executive Assistant District Attorney Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) to run point for the prosecution since he has to sit this one out.",
      "\u201cI especially thought this episode was so well done,\u201d Goldwyn says. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice because the cases are always interesting on \u2018Law & Order,\u2019 but to be able to bring in our personal lives and to discover more about the characters, it just makes it more interesting to play and explore.\u201d",
      "He also appreciates getting to work with \u201camazing co-stars like Maggie Siff.\u201d",
      "Goldwyn says he thought what was \u201cparticularly skillful about this episode\u201d was it \u201cvery much integrated\u201d Baxter\u2019s personal life into \u201cthe story of the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs opposed to something that would just be sort of tacked on as a, you know, a moment with Baxter outside of work, which is less interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis I thought was really cool because the case impacts the relationship in a really great way.\u201d",
      "What happens between Baxter and his girlfriend during the case on \u2018Law & Order\u2019?",
      "Lt. Jessica Brady (Maura Tierney) goes over to Baxter\u2019s place after police find the DA's business card in a victim's pocket. Baxter identifies the deceased as Powers, whom he says he ran into that morning. Then, his girlfriend enters the room.",
      "\u201cThat your new friend, Kate?\u201d Brady asks, continuing a playful exchange she had with Baxter in the last episode after seeing a bottle of wine he got from \u201cKate.\u201d",
      "Baxter confirms, and Brady responds, \u201cHm, punching above your weight.\u201d",
      "Tierney joined the cast this season, and Goldwyn says he was \u201cvery excited to work with her.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s sort of developing, in a subtle way, this kind of really interesting character with Brady,\u201d he explains, \u201cand similar to what we\u2019re saying about sort of our personal lives, you\u2019re getting a sense of a relationship developing between Baxter and Brady, which has a real sense of humor to it. They can kind of bust on each other. It takes away any kind of generic quality that can sometimes happen with procedural shows where you\u2019re just so focused on the plot.\u201d",
      "During another scene at home, Baxter and Kate have to cut their chat about the case short because Kate says the defendant, Gallow, reached out asking if she could represent her in court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m actually feeling really excited about it,\u201d Kate tells Baxter.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m feeling really excited,\u201d Baxter responds, before they kiss each other goodbye.",
      "\u201cI was excited to work with her, and she\u2019s, I thought, so good in this episode,\u201d Goldwyn says of Siff, who\u2019s more recently known for her work on \u201cBillions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had great kind of chemistry,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo, it\u2019s nice.\u201d",
      "Baxter then takes Price to a diner to tell him he\u2019s dating Kate, whom he says he\u2019s known since their time together at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Baxter reveals he will recuse himself but not the entire office.",
      "\u201cI recognize this puts you in an awkward position, so I don\u2019t want you and (ADA) Sam (Maroun) to feel any added pressure. Just treat this like any other case, and treat Kate like any other defense attorney,\u201d Baxter tells him.",
      "\u201cYeah, easier said than done,\u201d Price responds with an awkward laugh.",
      "Goldwyn credits showrunner Rick Eid for building the relationship between Price and his new superior.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tension between Price and Baxter,\u201d Goldwyn explains. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite sure how they felt about each other. And now, you get these sort of back-and-forth glimpses of a real respect and connection between them.\u201d",
      "While \u201cperiodically, it goes a little south,\u201d Goldwyn says, he enjoys the back and forth and \u201cnot feeling obliged to explain that too much.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I really like that little scene we have in the diner,\u201d he adds, \u201cwhere I just tell him, \u2018I\u2019m not going to give this to another prosecutor,\u2019 which indicates that Baxter has a lot of respect for Price.\u201d",
      "Over dinner at home one night, Kate brings up the case, and Baxter tries to shut down the conversation, as they agreed not to talk about it.",
      "Kate asks Baxter to let her client plead down to a lesser charge.",
      "Baxter tells her to talk to Price, and Kate says Price \u201cisn\u2019t willing to negotiate.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Baxter says. \u201cDon\u2019t go over Nolan\u2019s head, and don\u2019t try to play me against him.\u201d",
      "Then Baxter gets a message and meets Price, who informs him Kate threatened their eyewitness and got him to recant.",
      "Baxter returns home and confronts Kate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still going to win, Kate, despite what you did,\u201d he tells her.",

      "\u201cHe found this substantial woman \u2026 this thing might work. They really connected with each other, and she screws it up,\u201d he says. \u201cShe crosses the line, and I think it really upsets him.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, when we have the beginning of that fight, and I kind of shut her down, and then Nolan calls, and I go down to his car \u2026 and he mentions the case, and I snap at him, saying, \u2018I told you I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019 And I\u2019ve just been upstairs talking to my girlfriend about it. That\u2019s the kind of thing about where you get into the relationship dynamics that make it fun and kind of messy.\u201d",
      "Does Nicholas Baxter still have a girlfriend on \u2018Law & Order\u2019?",
      "Baxter ends up being right \u2014 his team does win, and Kate\u2019s client is found guilty.",
      "The final scene of the episode shows Baxter and Kate outside the courtroom after the jury reads the verdict.",
      "\u201cIt was a tough case,\u201d Baxter says to Kate. \u201cYou did what you could.\u201d",

      "\u201cI like the ambiguity of it,\u201d he adds.",

      "Baxter and his wife separated at the end of last season after their daughter was a witness in a case against his wife\u2019s wishes.",
      "\u201cIt felt not good for a guy who\u2019s going through a divorce \u2026 and his work got in the way of his marriage and his family,\u201d Goldwyn explains. \u201cAnd that was obviously quite painful. So now, here we go again.\u201d",
      "He adds he feels his character \u201clikes being involved with smart, dynamic, powerful women.\u201d",

      "The callback episode stems from \u201cUSS Callister,\u201d which follows a programmer named Robert Daly (played by Jesse Plemons) who creates a simulated reality within a \u201cStar Trek\u201d like video game, putting himself in the captain seat with his crew stemming from his actual co-workers (including actress Cristin Milioti).",
      "This will be the first time the show does a sequel episode.",

      "While many cast members have already been announced, such as Paul Giamatti, Awkafina, Rashida Jones, and Cristin Milioti, new cast members have additionally been added to the star-studded list, including Will Poulter.",
      "Poulter starred in the interactive \"Black Mirror\" movie \"Bandersnatch,\" playing a famous game creator named Colin Ritman. Based on the trailer, it appears he may be reprising the role."

      "Since Rebecca Yarros released her hit romantasy novel \"Fourth Wing\" in May 2023, the author has gone on to write and publish at least three more books. Now, she's planning on slowing down the pace.",
      "Over the course of her career, Yarros has published more than 10 books, including \"Fourth Wing,\" \"Iron Flame\" and \"Onyx Storm\" \u2014 the first three books in the \"Empyrean\" series. During an episode of the \"Open Book with Jenna\" podcast, Yarros reflected on her publishing pace with Jenna Bush Hager.",
      "Yarros said she had already written most of \u201cIron Flame\u201d by the time \u201cFourth Wing\u201d came out, so the sequel came out just six months after the first. Then in 2024, Yarros published a romance book, \u201cVariation.\u201d The\u00a0third book in the \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series, \u201cOnyx Storm,\u201c came out in January 2025.",
      "Yarros told Jenna that she was writing for 12 to 15 hours a day when she was on deadline for \"Onyx Storm\" and writing \"Variation.\"",
      "\"We're backing that down this year,\" Yarros said.",
      "Being there for her six kids is one of the reasons why.",
      "\"I have two kids \u2014 one who's a senior in college and one who's a senior in high school \u2014 and I need to be available for those last moments and those graduations and really focus at home because for two and a half years it's been all 'Empyrean,'\" Yarros said.",
      "Yarros shared that before the release of \"Fourth Wing,\" she sat down with her husband to have a conversation about the demands of publishing the series. Yarros, like the main character of \"Fourth Wing,\" has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which affects her body's connective tissue.",
      "\"I said, 'It's going to require me working hours that my body won't sustain, and I won't get to see the kids, and I won't get to do this,'\" Yarros recalled.",
      "She said her husband, a military veteran, told her, \"This is your turn.\"",
      "\"I remember him saying like, 'You took care of the family while I was gone and I'm going to take care of the family so you can do this. This is your turn. We can do this,'\" Yarros said.",
      "\"And we had a conscious decision, like a conscious choice for the first year,\" she added. \"And then it happened again. I was like, 'Well, they want to push 'Iron Flame' for six months,' and he's like, 'OK, if this is what you want to do.' And I said, 'I think we can do it.'\"",
      "But starting with the third book, which was published 14 months after the second, Yarros said they decided together to \"draw it back.\"",
      "\u201cI miss my kids, and I miss my family, and I feel like I wasn\u2019t able to be present because I was just driven by these deadlines,\u201d Yarros said. \u201cAnd so now being able to take a step back and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m still going to work and do this, but I need healthy hours. I need to work eight hours a day and not 12 to 15.\u2019\"",
      "In addition to wanting to slow her pace down for her family, she added that she wants to prioritize her own mental and physical health.",
      "\"I think you have to have a sustainable pace,\" Yarros said. \"So, in order to keep putting these books out, I had to slow it down so it's sustainable. Otherwise, it's burnout, and then no one gets books.\"",
      "But Yarros said she will \"always write.\"",
      "\"There will always be a time I'm in a real life situation and I look at two people and I think, 'How can I make you miserable and then make you fall in love?'\" she said. \"You know, it's just the way my brain's gonna work. I will probably write until I die.\"",
      "In fact, she's already dreaming up her next book. Yarros told Jenna the next book she writes will be a contemporary romance, instead of a new fantasy installment.",
      "\u201cI swing back and forth between the two,\u201d she said about rotating genres she writes.",
      "But \"Empyrean\" fans, never fear. Plans for the fourth book are underway.",
      "In January, Yarros told TODAY.com that she had already made the playlist for the next book in the \"Empyrean\" series \u2014 the first step in her writing process.",
      "While she couldn't share any songs on it (\u201cI think it would scare everyone,\u201d she said at the time), she did reveal the first song is by Taylor Swift, specifically from \"The Tortured Poets Department\" album.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a trade war,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe United States is resetting its trade relations globally to a level of equilibrium, to a level of reciprocity.\u201d",
      "That comment was in direct conflict with M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, who just hours earlier told reporters that the Trump administration \u201cwas engaging in a trade war against Canada\u201d and European countries. On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union after slapping 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada on Wednesday.",
      "Joly said she had a very long conversation with Rubio.",
      "\u201cWe will put maximum pressure on the Americans,\u201d she insisted.",
      "The contradiction between the two diplomats overshadowed the G7 meeting\u2019s official agenda, which included Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and relations with China. Instead, turmoil over tariffs loomed over the gathering. The newly frosty relationship between the longtime allies unfolded as frigid temperatures greeted the foreign ministers when they first arrived for the meeting on Tuesday. On Thursday, Trump once again mocked Canada from the Oval Office as the diplomats met in Qu\u00e9bec.",
      "\u201cCanada only works as a state,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything they have.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Joly blasted the comments and insisted she did not take them as a joke \u2014 but instead, as a serious threat.",
      "\u201cCanada\u2019s sovereignty is not up for debate,\u201d she said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic tussle between the U.S. and Canada also escalated in Ottawa Friday as Mark Carney was sworn in as the new prime minister.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. His point is crazy. That\u2019s it,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States.\u201d",
      "After initially stressing that the topic did not come up during his conversations with G7 diplomats, Rubio was pressed about whether Trump was serious when he says Canada should become the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe Canadian government has made their position, how they feel about it clear. The president has made his argument as to why he thinks Canada would be better off joining the United States for economic purposes,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere\u2019s a disagreement between the President\u2019s position and the position of the Canadian government.\u201d",
      "Rubio also noted the president says he loves Canada.",
      "Joly said she was trying to find an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to the trade dispute, but Rubio claimed there was no need for one because this was about the U.S. resetting its trade policy.",
      "Rubio also said Trump\u2019s tariff policy was not hostile to countries around the world, despite Trump calling the European Union \u201chostile and abusive\u201d Thursday on social media. In the Oval Office later in the day, Trump added: \u201cThe European Union is very, very nasty.\u201d",
      "During an interview with NBC News, Kaja Kallas, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security policy, said it was an overall \u201cgood\u201d G7 meeting and touted the discussions about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and a variety of issues. But she acknowledged the EU\u2019s diplomats didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s Thursday comments.",
      "\u201cOf course, these kinds of statements come as a surprise because we have long been friends and allies with the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of good things together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t really understand how we have deserved\u201d these comments, she said.",
      "Still, on Ukraine, the U.S. drew incrementally closer to its G7 allies Friday \u2014 at least for now. The gathering\u2019s joint foreign ministers\u2019 communique supported Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and warned Russia to accept a ceasefire or face possible further sanctions.",
      "Rubio denied it marked any shift in U.S. policy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard President Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not inconsistent with that statement.\u201d",
      "The agreement followed weeks of tension between U.S. allies and Trump over his Ukraine policy.",
      "The agreement among the G7 nations \u2014 comprising Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. \u2014 emphasized the need for \u201csecurity arrangements\u201d to secure a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, although Rubio declined to offer specifics on what those security arrangements might be. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had famously clashed with Trump in the Oval Office over the issue of the U.S. providing security guarantees to move along a peace deal.",
      "Speaking with reporters, Rubio also touted a \u201cpositive and productive engagement\u201d between Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladamir Putin Thursday in Moscow, but he declined to speculate about the next steps in any ceasefire negotiations because Witkoff was still en route back to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think there was reason to be optimistic,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBy the same token, we continue to recognize this is a difficult and complex situation.\u201d",
      "Rubio was asked by NBC News whether he trusted Putin.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an irrelevant question,\u201d he responded. \u201cI think in foreign policy, it\u2019s not about trusting. It\u2019s about action\u2026You can\u2019t just say you want peace. You have to do peace \u2014 and that\u2019s true for both sides in any conflict.\u201d",

      "The comments by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov after Putin met with Trump administration envoy Steve Witkoff echoed those of the Russian president, who said Thursday that he in theory accepted the ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine \u2014 but only on terms tantamount to a victory over Ukraine.",
      "It was an emphatic \"yes, but.\"",
      "\u201cWe agree with the proposals to stop the hostilities,\u201d Putin said in a speech. But only if it leads \u201cto long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\u201d",
      "That term \u2014 \u201croot causes\u201d \u2014 is a reference to long-held Russian grievances about what it sees as NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Western officials and analysts reject this, saying Putin wants to subjugate Ukraine, drawing it into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence and away from its European tilt.",
      "Despite flirting with the Trump administration, there is little evidence Putin has shifted from his core war goals: cementing his land grabs in Ukraine and stopping it from ever joining NATO. Even so, Trump on Thursday called Putin's remark \u201ca promising statement.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump called his administration's discussions with Putin \"very good and productive,\" expressing optimism \"that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.\"",
      "Switching to all caps, Trump highlighted the stakes of the ceasefire, while positioning himself as a peacemaker by noting that thousands of Ukrainian troops are \"completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position.\"",
      "\"I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!\" he added.",
      "Many officials and experts across Ukraine and Europe are far less impressed.",
      "During his nightly address Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Putin\u2019s words \u201cmanipulative.\u201d",
      "\"Putin often does this \u2014 he does not say \u2018no\u2019 directly, but he does it in such a way that practically everything only delays it and makes normal decisions impossible,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cPutin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "Indeed, hours after Putin spoke, his military fired 27 drones at Ukraine overnight into Friday, Ukraine's Armed Forces said.",
      "Some were shot down, according to Ukraine's military, but one hit a civilian hospital in the western village of Zolochiv, setting fire to the building and injuring one staff member.",
      "In the southern city of Kherson, NBC News found a scene of destruction after Russia's latest bombing, which occurs most nights.",
      "Rescue workers were clearing rubble and fixing power lines in a residential area where several homes were blown apart in what they said was a Russian glide bomb attack the day before.",
      "Mykola Vorobjovskii, 69, said he was inside his house when it was destroyed.",
      "\u201cPutin is a liar,\u201d Vorobjovskii told NBC News, choking back tears as he stood next to the wreckage of his home. \u201cHe calls black white and white black. He said he is liberating Ukraine. He liberated me from my house, job and car.\u201d",
      "Some Western experts believe the Russian leader is in a tight spot and that his evasive response was an attempt to balance two competing realities.",
      "First, the Kremlin has no reason to accept a truce unless it delivers him a favorable outcome; and second, he wants to achieve a settlement with the White House while it is led by a president amenable to Moscow, said Jonathan Eyal, a director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in Putin\u2019s interest to get a ceasefire now,\" Eyal said Friday.  \"However, he cannot afford to annoy the American president, and expose and humiliate him with an outright rejection.\u201d",
      "The deal on offer to Putin is not going to improve, Eyal said, adding that the Russian president has \u201cgot an amazing opportunity to return to the global stage and [escape] from his isolation \u2014 with the help of the United States,\u201d he added. So \u201che\u2019s got to try to grab this deal without making too many concessions on Ukraine, and that\u2019s his dilemma.\u201d",
      "Officials in Kyiv will be hoping to use Putin\u2019s \u201cevasive\u201d response to \u201chelp convince their American colleagues that the Kremlin dictator is not genuinely interested in ending the war,\u201d wrote Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukrainian think tank.",
      "While Putin may entertain a truce with terms favorable to Moscow, he will not accept an independent Ukrainian state on Russia\u2019s border, Bielieskov wrote for the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cThis does not mean that current U.S.-led peace efforts are entirely futile, but it is vital to recognize that freezing the conflict along the current front lines will not be enough to end the war.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,\u201d DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. \u201cWhen you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\u201d",
      "The latest arrest comes as students at Columbia say they are fearful that they and their friends could be unjustly targeted amid a tense climate on campus, hours after federal agents executed search warrants on two university residences.",
      "Todd Blanche, U.S. deputy attorney general, said Friday that the Justice Department is working with DHS as part of an investigation into Columbia's \"harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.\"",
      "While school officials told students that no arrests were made and no items seized when DHS agents entered two student rooms on Thursday night, foreign students remained on edge.",
      "The Ivy League\u2019s campus in upper Manhattan has seen renewed demonstrations in recent days following the arrest Saturday of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student and legal permanent resident who was publicly involved in negotiations during last year\u2019s school protests.",
      "Many students approached by NBC News declined to comment, but some who agreed to speak asked not to be named for fear of government retaliation.",
      "\"This is exactly what I was worried about months ago,\" said an engineering student from the United Kingdom who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations last spring over the war in Gaza. The student said he was worried about campus raids and other potential intervention by the federal government.",
      "\"It's also like, you don't know the scope of the people they're trying to target because thousands of students were involved in this in some capacity. It would have been on camera,\" the student said, adding, \"Logically nothing is going to happen to me, but it's stressful.\"",
      "Columbia\u2019s American students are rallying around their international counterparts as well after the federal agents searched the two student residences.",
      "Another student, who is American, said she was \"shocked\" when she read the email from Katrina Armstrong, Columbia's interim president, informing students that DHS had served the university with judicial search warrants signed by a federal magistrate judge.",
      "\"It is pretty frightening. The school is doing everything in their power to do their best to keep students safe, but I think there\u2019s a limit to what they're able to do,\" the student, a junior, said. \"Last night was evidence of that limit.\"",
      "Sebastian\u00a0Javadpoor, 22, said he was \"overcome with rage\" upon the latest search warrants.",
      "Javadpoor, who leads the university's student-led Democratic club, said he and about a dozen other student leaders met with school officials to convey their fears.",

They're too afraid to even seek support and services from the administration itself.\"",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil as part of an effort to revoke his green card and deport him, his lawyers said. Khalil, 30, an Algerian citizen and pro-Palestinian activist, is married to a U.S. citizen and was arrested at his university-owned residential building.",

      "The administration says the school must make sweeping policy changes, including a ban on masks \"intended to conceal identity or intimidate others,\" and allowing for \"full law enforcement authority, including arrest and removal of agitators.\" Columbia has said it would work with the administration to ensure funding continues and is \"committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson has\u00a0said Khalil's arrest was in coordination with ICE and the State Department \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism\" because Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\"",
      "His arrest was only the latest action to roil the campus after the last school year, when student protesters occupied Hamilton Hall, leading to dozens of arrests for trespassing. While nearly all of the related charges were eventually dropped, the school on Thursday said it has suspended or expelled some of the students who participated and temporarily revoked some diplomas of those who graduated.",
      "On Friday, dozens of police barricades surrounded the university's main entrance. The university gates that once remained open to all New Yorkers were locked shut as students flashed their badges to get to class, shuffling past police officers, news cameras and flocks of campus security.",

      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t let our dreams be shattered and the Taliban decide our fate,\u201d the students\u2019 letter reads. \u201cWe have fought very hard to get out of their hands, we won\u2019t be living anymore if we have to go back to Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "The program for female scholars was launched in 2019 with a $50 million endowment from USAID, according to Brian Le, deputy legislative director of With Honor, a nonprofit group that works with veterans in Congress from both parties on bipartisan initiatives. Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",
      "Nonprofit groups are in discussions with the government of Oman to try to resolve the situation, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to avoid is their return to Afghanistan, which would functionally amount to a death sentence for these women who have been aided by the United States in pursuing higher education opportunities,\u201d Le said.",
      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said the elimination of the scholarship program was \u201cshameful\u201d and called on the Trump administration to reverse course.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration thinks it\u2019s politically advantageous to villainize USAID, but Americans need to realize that behind the cancelled contracts and mass layoffs are innocent lives now put at risk,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cIn this case, these bright young women with the world ahead of them could receive what could amount to a death sentence in a matter of days \u2014 simply because they were relying on a US-funded scholarship to get their education abroad.\u201d"

      "Investigators are searching for Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing on a spring break trip with her college friends in the Dominican Republic last week.",
      "Multiple international agencies have been searching for Konanki since she disappeared March 6 as the investigation nears its second week.",
      "Here's what we know about the case.",
      "Who is Sudiksha Konanki?",
      "Konanki, 20, is a junior in biology at the University of Pittsburgh, according to the Loudoun County, Virginia, Sheriff's Office. She is an Indian citizen and permanent U.S. resident who lives with her family in Chantilly, Virginia, which is in Loudoun County.",
      "She traveled to Punta Cana from Pitt on March 3 with five female friends for spring break, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Konanki is in the South Asian fusion a cappella group Avaaz at college, according to the\u00a0group\u2019s Instagram account.",
      "When was Konanki last seen?",
      "Konanki was last seen early March 6 after she went to the beach with friends.",
      "She disappeared after 4:15 a.m., after her friends left the beach but she stayed behind with people she met on the trip.",
      "Security video showed Konanki and her friends entering the beach area in the Riu Republica Resort, where they were staying, Dominican Republic National Police said.",
      "Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman told\u00a0NBC Washington\u00a0on Monday that Konanki's friends returned to the hotel after about 40 minutes and that Konanki stayed with the others whom she met and who were not friends from college.",
      "One of the last people who had contact with her said that \"a wave hit them while they were on the beach and caused some kind of situation,\" Dominican President Luis Abinader said at a\u00a0news conference Monday, citing local reports. Abinader said at the time that authorities were trying to piece together what happened.",
      "Konanki's friends went on an excursion Thursday and did not realize she had disappeared until they returned, about 12 hours later, at which point they told the hotel about their missing friend, National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said.",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office was then notified of her disappearance, Chapman said.",
      "National Police launched a search effort Friday morning, using drones, helicopters, divers, boats and canine units. The search effort was expanded Monday.",
      "Konanki's friends were supposed to return to the United States on Friday but stayed back to aid in the search,\u00a0sheriff's spokesperson Thomas Julia said.",
      "The hotel said that beach access is always open and that security guards are stationed around the hotel and the area.",
      "What do we know about the investigation?",
      "Multiple agencies are involved in the investigation, which is being led by Dominican police, the Dominican attorney general's office, the FBI and a U.S. Embassy liaison.\u00a0The U.S. Coast Guard is also involved.",
      "The University of Pittsburgh said it was in contact with Konanki's family and offering support in the investigation. The Indian Embassy in the Dominican Republic is also helping in the investigation, Chapman said.",
      "Konanki\u2019s family traveled to Punta Cana to aid in search efforts but returned to Virginia. They declined to comment on the search.",
      "La Altagracia Civil Defense, the local Dominican emergency operations agency,\u00a0shared photos of multiple agencies searching  the beach\u00a0over the weekend. The hotel was also assisting in search efforts, it said.",
      "Authorities have said it's not clear whether Konanki\u2019s disappearance is accidental or whether foul play was involved. No signs of blood or violence were found at the beach, Pesqueira said.",
      "National Police sent teams to monitor the beach overnight at least twice to watch how the water moves to see where a body would drift if someone drowned and to see where the waves crash.",
      "A hotel spokesperson said red flags \u2014\u00a0which indicate \"that the sea had a strong current and very high waves\" \u2014\u00a0were flying when Konanki disappeared.",
      "Dominican authorities said Thursday morning that the search was moving from the Riu Republic Resort to Macao Beach.",
      "Officials are also looking into Konanki's phone and texts, said Chapman, the Loudoun County sheriff. She did not appear to have a history of excessive drinking, he said.",
      "The sheriff's office said it filed for Interpol to issue a yellow notice, a worldwide police alert for a missing person, which will alert authorities if she travels to another country.",
      "\"We are going on the presumption that she\u2019s still alive,\" Chapman said Monday. \"We want to make sure that we're exhausting every possible lead that we can, and we feel we're doing that.\"",
      "Has a person of interest been identified?",
      "A person of interest has been identified and was interviewed at length, Julia, the sheriff's office spokesperson, told NBC News. The sheriff's office has no jurisdiction over the case but sent detectives to the island to assist local investigators.",
      "A person of interest is \"not the same thing as a suspect, as this is not a criminal matter. It is still a missing person case,\" Julia said.",
      "National Police said Thursday morning that they do not use the term \"person of interest\" in their investigations and that no one is considered a suspect at this point.",
      "The man, Joshua Riibe, spoke to local authorities Thursday, a sheriff's spokesperson told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Riibe may have been the last person to see Konanki alive. He told local investigators they were on the beach \"in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,\" according to a transcript of the interview that NBC News obtained.",
      "Then, a wave crashed, sweeping them both \"out to sea,\" Riibe said in the interview.",
      "\"I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,\" he said. He told local authorities that he used to work as a lifeguard and that he made sure to get them both back to shore.",
      "That's when she disappeared, he said.",
      "\"The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her answer,\" he said. \"I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she'd grabbed her things and left.\"",
      "According to the interview, Riibe said he was surprised to later learn that Konanki was missing."

      "Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi has long ruled out dialogue with the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels rampaging through eastern parts of his country, but a string of defeats and waning regional support have forced him to think again.",
      "Neighboring Angola\u00a0caught many by surprise\u00a0this week by saying Congo and M23 would sit down for direct talks in its capital on March 18, at a time when the rebels are still seizing territory rich with coltan, tantalum and other minerals.",
      "Tshisekedi\u2019s government has so far not committed publicly, but three government sources told Reuters this week he was seriously considering sending a delegation.",
      "With Congo\u2019s army and allied forces putting up\u00a0weak resistance\u00a0to the rebel advance, regional powers appear in agreement that dialogue is the only way forward, diplomats and analysts said.",

      "Other sources said the debate was still ongoing and that a final decision was not likely to be made until next week.",
      "M23, for its part, said on Thursday it was\u00a0demanding an unequivocal commitment\u00a0from Tshisekedi to engage in talks.",
      "Both sides said they had questions about the framework and how the Angola-hosted talks would comply with decisions from regional bodies\u00a0attempting to resolve the conflict.",
      "Southern and East African foreign and defense ministers are due to meet in Harare on Monday to discuss the push for a cessation of hostilities and political dialogue.",
      "'Failed Approach'",
      "M23 is backed by thousands of Rwandan troops, according to U.N. experts, and their superior weaponry and equipment has allowed them to seize east Congo\u2019s two biggest cities since late January along with a host of smaller localities.",
      "Rwanda denies providing arms and troops to M23, and says its forces are acting in self-defense against the Congolese army and militias hostile to Kigali.",
      "Sitting down with M23 would likely be deeply unpopular in Kinshasa, especially after Tshisekedi\u2019s repeated vows never to do so.",
      "But it would amount to an acknowledgment that Tshisekedi\u2019s pursuit of a military solution has \u201cfailed\u201d, said Congolese analyst Bob Kabamba of the University of Liege in Belgium.",
      "\u201cKinshasa\u2019s position of dialogue is understandable because it finds itself stuck, thinking that the (rebel alliance) must not reach a critical threshold,\u201d he said.",
      "Congo\u2019s neighbor Angola may have made a similar calculation, wary of being drawn into a larger-scale regional war reminiscent of those that killed millions in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "\u201cAngola has clearly decided that it is necessary to intervene to prevent the advance of the M23 towards the west of the\u00a0DRC,\u201d said Stephanie Wolters, a Congo analyst with South Africa\u2019s Institute for Security Studies.",
      "The lack of faith in Tshisekedi\u2019s ability to turn the tide militarily was also seen this week in Southern African leaders\u2019 approval of the\u00a0\u201cphased withdrawal\u201d\u00a0of a regional deployment known as SAMIDRC\u00a0that had a mandate to fight rebels.",
      "Although the deployment was too weak to mean much in the fight against M23, its presence was an important sign of regional support for Congo, Wolters said, making its departure a \u201csignificant blow\u201d."

      "The suspect told police that he got to know Sato through her livestreaming and had seen her in person a number of times, and that they had a financial dispute, according to media reports, including the Asahi newspaper.",
      "Broadcaster NHK reported that Takano had lent Sato a large sum of money and that she did not pay him back despite a court order to do so.",
      "Takano traveled from the city of Oyama, about 60 miles north of Tokyo, to carry out the attack after Sato announced the livestream and tracked down her location by watching the footage, media reports said, quoting police.",
      "He told police he did not intend to kill her.",
      "Violent crimes are still rare in Japan, where gun control is extremely strict, but there have been a number of high-profile knife attacks and others using handmade guns in recent years amid a bleak wage and employment outlook."

    "summary": "United Nations-backed human rights experts accused Israel of the use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence in its war with Hamas in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "United Nations-backed human rights experts on Thursday accused Israel of \u201cthe systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence\u201d in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The allegations came in one of the most extensive reports of its kind on the issue since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited the war.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the Human Rights Council, a U.N.-backed body that commissioned the team of independent experts, as an \u201canti-Israel circus\u201d that \u201chas long been exposed as an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting, and irrelevant body.\u201d His statement did not address the findings themselves.",
      "The findings by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which seeks to document in minute detail the allegations and evidence of crimes to bolster accountability for perpetrators, could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or in other jurisdictions to try to bring justice to victims and their relatives.",
      "In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to \u201cdisproportionate violence against women and children.\u201d",
      "The commission documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations.",
      "\u201cOur report finds that Israel has increasingly employed sexual, reproductive, and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians as part of a broader effort to undermine their right to self-determination,\u201d Chris Sidoti, a member of the commission, told reporters in Geneva.",
      "Israel\u2019s mission in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the commission of relying on \u201csecond-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.\u201d Since the commission was set up in 2021 \u2014 long before the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel \u2014 Israel has refused to cooperate with it, accusing the investigative team and the council of bias.",
      "Commission member Sidoti said the report \u201calso concludes that Israel has carried out genocidal acts through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive health care facilities.\u201d",
      "The commission stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide, as some advocacy groups and other rights experts have. Israel, which was established in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust and is home to many survivors and their families, has vigorously denied such allegations.",
      "Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. Israeli forces carried out a number of raids on hospitals, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.",
      "Pointing to the report, a Hamas statement urged international courts to prosecute Israel\u2019s leaders.",
      "The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of war crimes, which they deny. The court also issued a warrant in November for Hamas\u2019 military leader, but the militants have since confirmed that he was killed.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages.",
      "Israeli authorities, citing eyewitness accounts and other evidence, have accused Hamas-led militants of widespread rape and sexual violence. Israeli experts who have treated former hostages say some were subjected to physical and sexual abuse in captivity.",
      "A U.N. envoy last year reported \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe such allegations.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.",
      "On Tuesday and Wednesday, the commission held public hearings with victims, lawyers, advocacy groups and others whose accounts were included in the report.",
      "The commission was not considering allegations of sexual, gender-based and other violence committed against Israelis during the Oct. 7 attack or against hostages in Gaza, but reported on the issue last year."

      "Rutte, sitting next to Trump, did not directly comment on the president\u2019s statement because he said he did not \u201cwant to drag NATO\u201d into the issue, according to Reuters.",
      "But, Rutte added, \u201cWe know things are changing there, and we have to be there.\u201d",
      "The sharp exchange between Trump and Greenland's leaders comes after the self-governing region of Denmark held a tightly contested parliamentary election earlier this week, in which the pro-business Demokraatit party defeated Egede\u2019s ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party in a surprise result. The Demokraatit party will now need to form a coalition government.",
      "Jens-Frederik Nielsen, the country's likely next prime minister, has also rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion. In a Facebook post Thursday, he said the president\u2019s statement was \u201cinappropriate and just shows once again that we must stand together in such situations.\u201d",
      "Greenland, the world's largest island, sparsely populated with 56,000 people, was thrust into the limelight after Trump took office Jan. 20 and called for its U.S. acquisition, saying its vast mineral wealth and existing U.S. military base are strategically important against rivals Russia and China.",
      "All candidates ahead of Greenland's election said they did not want their island to become part of the U.S. amid growing calls for independence from Denmark, its former colonial ruler, which still controls decisions on foreign and defense policy.",
      "Greenland won the right to hold a referendum to gain full independence from Denmark in 2009, but a poll at the time also found that many were divided on the pace at which to do so.",
      "On Thursday, Trump also undermined Copenhagen\u2019s claim to the island, saying it was \u201cvery far away and really has nothing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cA boat landed there 200 years ago or something? And they say they have rights to it. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think it is,\u201d he added.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion in the past, stating that \u201cGreenland is not for sale.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Syria\u2019s interim president on Thursday signed a temporary constitution that leaves the country under Islamist rule while promising to protect the rights of all Syrians for five years during a transitional phase.",
      "The nation\u2019s interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of Syria since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency that overthrew longtime President Bashar al-Assad in December.",
      "Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now the country\u2019s interim president \u2014 a decision that was announced after a meeting of the armed groups that took part in the offensive against Assad. At the same meeting, the groups agreed to repeal the country\u2019s old constitution and said a new one would be drafted.",
      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of more than 50 years in the war-torn country, religious and ethnic minorities have been skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new authorities to assert control of their areas.",
      "Abdulhamid Al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee al-Sharaa tasked to draft the temporary constitution, told a news conference Thursday that it would maintain some provisions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state has to be a Muslim, and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence.",
      "But Al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at Mardin Artuklu University in Turkey, also said that the temporary constitution includes provisions that enshrine freedom of expression and the media.",
      "The constitution will \u201cbalance between social security and freedom\u201d during Syria\u2019s shaky political situation, he said, and will set up an \u201cabsolute and rigid separation\u201d between legislative, executive and judicial authorities.",
      "The text of the temporary constitution, published late Thursday, sets up a People\u2019s Committee which will serve as an interim parliament until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections held. Two-thirds of its members will be appointed by a committee selected by the interim president and one-third by al-Sharaa himself.",
      "The documents says the state is \u201ccommitted to combatting all forms of violent extremism while respecting rights and freedoms\u201d and that \u201ccitizens are equal before the law in rights and duties, without discrimination based on race, religion, gender or lineage.\u201d It stipulates that the army is a \u201cprofessional national institution\u201d and arms outside of its control are prohibited and designates \u201cglorifying the former Assad regime\u201d as a crime."

      "Putin had expressed concern that the temporary ceasefire suggested by the United States and Ukraine would give Kyiv's forces an opportunity to regroup and questioned the mechanisms for preventing that during a potential ceasefire. Details like who would monitor and enforce the truce would also need to be considered, he said.",
