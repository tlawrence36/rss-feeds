      "In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown season seven's winning couple Sunday evening after a tumultuous season",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown the winning couple of its seventh season Sunday evening, culminating a tumultuous summer full of explosive breakups and shock exits.",
      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",
      "Carthen and Vansteenberghe ultimately recoupled in the same episode.",
      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is considering \u201ctaking away\u201d the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \u201cif they want her.\u201d",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Trump\u2019s involvement in politics. In recent days, O\u2019Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \u201cIn short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\u201d",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "Responding to Trump Saturday, O\u2019Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and \u201cadd me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\" is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration and a theatrical re-release",
      "Jack Nicholson did not want to go to the Oscars. It was 1976 and he was nominated for best actor in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d The Milo\u0161 Forman film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a nationwide theatrical re-release on July 13 and July 16, had become a bit of a sensation \u2014 the second highest grossing picture of 1975, behind \u201cJaws,\u201d and had received nine Oscar nominations.",
      "But Nicholson wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic. In five years, he\u2019d already been nominated five times. He\u2019d also lost five times. And he told his producer, Michael Douglas, that he couldn\u2019t go through it again.",
      "\u201cI remember how hard I had to persuade Jack to come to the ceremony. He was so reluctant, but we got him there,\u201d Douglas said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then of course we lost the first four awards. Jack was sitting right in front of me and sort of leaned back and said \u2019Oh, Mikey D, Mikey D, I told you, man.\u2019 I just said, \u2018Hang in there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Douglas, of course, was right. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d would go on to sweep the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2014 screenplay, director, actor, actress and picture \u2014 the first film to do so in 41 years, (\u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d in 1934) which only \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d has done since. That night was one of many vindicating moments for a film that no one wanted to make or distribute that has quite literally stood the test of time.",
      "\u201cThis is my first 50th anniversary,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first movie I ever produced. To have a movie that\u2019s so lasting, that people get a lot out of, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s bringing back a lot of great memories.\u201d",
      "The film adaption of Ken Kesey\u2019s countercultural novel was a defining moment for Douglas, a son of Hollywood who was stuck in television and got a lifeline to film when his father, Kirk Douglas, gave him the rights to the book, and many of the then-unknown cast like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.",
      "DeVito was actually the first person officially cast. Douglas, who\u2019d known him for nearly 10 years, brought Forman to see him play Martini on stage.",
      "\u201cMilo\u0161 said, \u2018Yes! Danny! Perfect! Cast!\u2019 Douglas said in his best Czech accent. \u201cIt was a big moment for Danny. But I always knew how talented he was.\u201d",
      "Though the film's themes are challenging, unlike many of its New Hollywood contemporaries it wasn\u2019t a tortured shoot by any stretch. They had their annoyances (like Forman refusing to show the cast dailies) and more serious trials (they found out halfway through production that William Redfield was dying of leukemia), but for the most part it was fun.",
      "\u201cWe were very serious about the work, because Milo\u0161 was very serious. And we had the material, Kesey\u2019s work, and the reverence for that. We were not frivolous about it. But we did have a ball doing it,\u201d DeVito said, laughing.",
      "Part of that is because they filmed on location at a real state hospital in Salem, Oregon. Everyone stayed in the same motel and would board the same bus in the morning to get to set. It would have been hard not to bond and even harder if they hadn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThere was full commitment,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat comes when you don\u2019t go home at night to your own lives. We stopped for lunch on the first day and I saw Jack kind of push his tray away and go outside to get some air. I said, \u2018Jack, you OK?\u2019 He said, \u2019Who are these guys? Nobody breaks character! It\u2019s lunch time and they\u2019re all acting the same way!'\u201d",
      "Not disproving Nicholson\u2019s point, DeVito remembers he and the cast even asked if they could just sleep in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cThe floor above us had some seriously disturbed people who had committed murder.\u201d",
      "The film will be in theaters again on July 13 and July 16 from Fathom Entertainment. It\u2019s a new 4K restoration from the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Films with an introduction by Leonard Maltin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous print and reminds me how good the sound was,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "DeVito thinks it, \u201cholds up in a really big way, because Milo\u0161 really was paying attention to all great things in the screenplay and the story originally.\u201d",
      "Besides the shock of \u201choly Toledo, am I that old?\u201d DeVito said that it was a treasure to be part of \u2014 and he continues to see his old friends, including Douglas, Lloyd and, of course, Nicholson, who played the protagonist, R.P. McMurphy.",
      "One person Douglas thinks hasn\u2019t gotten the proper attention for his contributions to \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d is producer Saul Zaentz, who died in 2014. His music company, Fantasy Records who had Creedence Clearwater Revival, funded the endeavor which started at a $1.6 million budget and ballooned to $4 million by the end. He was a gambler, Douglas said, and it paid off.",
      "And whatever sour grapes might have existed between Douglas and his father, who played R.P. McMurphy on Broadway and dreamt of doing so on film, were perhaps over-exaggerated. It was ultimately important for their relationship.",
      "\u201cMcMurphy is as good a part as any actor is going to get, and I\u2019m now far enough in my career to understand maybe you have four, maybe five good parts, really great parts. I\u2019m sure for dad that was one of them,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "\u201cTo not be able to see it through was probably disappointing on one side. On the other, the fact that his son did it and the picture turned out so good? Thank God the picture turned out. It would have been a disaster if it hadn\u2019t.\"",
      "Douglas added: \u201cIt was a fairy tale from beginning to end. I doubt anything else really came close to it. Even my Oscar for best actor years later didn\u2019t really surpass that moment very early in my career.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts aimed to do a lot of good \u2014 helping to raise over $100 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and inspiring worldwide awareness for a cause it might otherwise have ignored.",
      "Simulcast from Philadelphia and London on July 13, 1985, Live Aid was the most ambitious global television event of its time: 16 hours of live music in two different continents featuring Queen, The Who, a Led Zeppelin reunion and more.",
      "A lot has changed in the years since. \u201cLive Aid, '85 to now, is the same distance as the Second World War from Live Aid,\u201d notes Rick Springfield, laughingly. \u201cThat\u2019s how long ago it was.\u201d",
      "Artists who performed at Live Aid \u2014 Springfield, organizer Bob Geldof, Hall and Oates' John Oates and Judas Priest's Rob Halford \u2014 reflected on the event and its impact in interviews with The Associated Press ahead of the 40th anniversary on Sunday.",
      "Here's what they had to say:",
      "At John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Springfield performed between Run-DMC and REO Speedwagon \u2014 just a taste of the diversity of performers featured on the transnational lineup. \u201cRun-DMC, I remember thinking, \u2018What is this? Three guys talking over a record player. What is that? Little did I know that it was about to change the whole game,\u201d he says, laughing. He remembers playing an electric set \u2014 no \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d because \u201cback then, it was just my first hit. ... It hadn't gone on to become this cultural thing.\"",
      "Hall and Oates' John Oates had a different experience. His band also played in Philly \u2014 their hometown \u2014 and in 1985, his band was one of the biggest on the planet. They played near the end of the night, joined by the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin and remained on stage to back the Rolling Stones' dynamic frontman Mick Jagger. The British rockstar had a trick up his sleeve.",
      "\u201cHe didn't tell us that he was bringing Tina Turner out,\u201d Oates says. \u201cWe had rehearsed a certain amount of songs with him. But then when he brought her out, it just jacked up the level of energy like you can\u2019t believe.\u201d",
      "Judas Priest singer Rob Halford counts \u201cMike and Tina, of course,\u201d as one of his Philly Live Aid highlights. \u201cLed Zeppelin, too.\u201d",
      "But most exciting of all for the heavy metal frontman? Meeting folk hero Joan Baez. The band had previously covered her classic \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\"",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s gonna come and kick me in the ass for wrecking her beautiful song,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe gives me a quick hug and goes, \u2018The reason I\u2019m here is because my son said to me, if you see Rob Halford from Judas Priest at the Live Aid Show in Philadelphia, will you tell him from me that I prefer Judas Priest\u2019s version to my mom\u2019s version?' ... It was a display of such kindness.\"",
      "Twenty years after Live Aid, Geldof organized Live 8 \u2014 an even larger undertaking in the new internet era, with 10 concerts happening simultaneously and across the globe.",
      "If the trend were to continue, there should be another event taking place this year. Notably, there isn't.",
      "Geldof says that's because there couldn't be a Live Aid-type event in 2025. He cites social media as a cause. In his view, algorithmic fracturing has made it impossible to create monolithic musical and activistic moments. Instead, he views the current media landscape as bolstering \"an echo chamber of your own prejudices.\u201d",
      "For something like Live Aid to work, \u201cYou need rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a creature of a social, economic and technological movement,\" he says. \u201cAnd I think the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll age is over. ... It did determine how young people articulated change and the desire for it. ... That isn't the case anymore.\u201d",
      "Springfield agrees. \u201cI think we are too divided,\u201d he says. He believes the world wouldn't be able to agree on a single cause to support, or even which musicians to back. \u201cYou could never do a thing with the size of Live Aid unless it was some kind of universal thing of, \u2018Let\u2019s bring everybody together.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNever say never, but I highly doubt it,\u201d says Oates. \u201cThe landscape of music and entertainment in general has changed so drastically.\"",
      "He points to \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the 1985 charity single for African famine relief that included the voices of Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and many more, as an example. \u201cThe idea of that happening with the stars of today all in one place, I can\u2019t even imagine that.

      "Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega has released a video on TikTok apologizing for previously using a racial slur against Asian people",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega apologized Wednesday for resurfaced posts where she used a racial slur against Asian people.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained the slur.",
      "Ortega addressed the entire Asian community in her nearly five minute TikTok video and said she is \u201cdeeply, truly, honestly so sorry.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not an apology video. This is an accountability video,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that the word held as much pain, as much harm, and came with the history that it did, or I never would have used it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI had no ill intention when I was using it, but that\u2019s absolutely no excuse because intent doesn\u2019t excuse ignorance.\u201d",
      "Ortega, who has been back in the United States for about 48 hours, said she has struggled most with the backlash experienced by her family, who she said doesn't feel safe in their own home, and have had immigration authorities called on them.",
      "\u201cThere's no need to fight hate with hate. I don't think that that's justice,\" Ortega said. \"And if you want to know that you're heard and that I'm sorry and that I will move differently, I promise you, that's what will happen.\u201d",
      "Ortega\u2019s removal from the villa was announced early in Sunday\u2019s episode. Host Iain Stirling said she had left \u201cdue to a personal situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI completely agree with the network\u2019s decision to remove me from the villa. I think that this is something that deserved punishment and the punishment has absolutely been received,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Her video made no mention of her \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Nic Vansteenberghe. He remained in the villa single when Ortega left, ultimately recoupling with fellow islander Orlandria Carthen in the same episode. The couple is still in competition as of Tuesday\u2019s episode.",
      "Ortega said she was unaware she was using a racial slur until a follower pointed it out after she posted an Instagram story in 2024 that used the term. It was one of the posts that resurfaced during her time in the villa.",
      "At this point, Ortega said \u201cthe word was immediately removed from my vocabulary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that moving forward, my actions and how I decide to live my life from here on out is gonna speak louder than any apology ever could,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Ortega\u2019s departure from the villa followed Yulissa Escobar, who left the villa last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Escobar, who initially issued an apology on her Instagram story shortly after she departed the villa, took to TikTok a day after Ortega left to ask viewers to stop cyberbullying contestants.",
      "\u201cI know what I said was wrong. I know what Cierra said was wrong, and I know it hurt communities,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cAll I ask you guys is instead of threatening her and her family, try to educate us, her, me.\u201d",
      "Escobar said she was \u201chonestly scared to come home,\u201d when she first got her phone back after exiting the villa and saw the messages she had received.",
      "\u201cI was like, is something going to happen to me? Like, is somebody going to do something to me? Because it was just a lot to take in and even my family was worried,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take that when you\u2019re getting all these threats online.\u201d",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form. Sunday's finale will culminate with one couple who receives the most public votes being awarded $100,000.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",

      "APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community near the state capital, the project\u2019s health systems announced Thursday, creating a campus estimated to bring 8,000 jobs to the area.",
      "UNC Health and Duke Health announced in January an agreement to jointly build the proposed 500-bed pediatric hospital and linked facilities in the state\u2019s Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.",
      "At that time, the specific location wasn't finalized. But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in the Wake County town of Apex. Apex has a population of 77,000, which is already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",
      "More than 15 potential sites in several counties were considered, Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese said at an Apex news conference.",
      "The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus, located near a regional transportation interchange, will also include a children\u2019s outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds and a research and education center operated by Duke University and University of North Carolina medical schools.",
      "The campus is poised to be integrated into a long-discussed mixed-use development location called Veridea that will include thousands of new homes, retail, dining, office and research space, as well as a new Wake Technical Community College campus.",
      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The new children's hospital agreed to acquire a portion of the Veridea land, which is owned by a business partnership between the North Carolina state retirement system and the land developers, according to the State Treasurer's Office, which administers the system.",
      "State Treasurer Brad Briner said at the news conference that the land sale is a win for everyone involved, including government retirees and the pension system, \"making a modest profit and unlocking more value in the land that is adjacent.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove all, it's a win for the 11 million North Carolinians who deserve world-class pediatric care right here at home,\u201d he added.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

      "BOBO-DIOULASSO, Burkina Faso -- Isaka Diallo was playing with friends when a stone struck his left eye. For two weeks, his parents searched hospitals in western Burkina Faso for an eye doctor. The village clinic only prescribed painkillers. Other health workers did not know what to do.",
      "When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo, Burkina Faso\u2019s only pediatric ophthalmologist, the injury had become too difficult to treat.",
      "\u201cThe trauma has become severe,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said of Diallo\u2019s condition as she attended to him recently at the Sanou Sourou University Hospital in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cCases like (Diallo\u2019s) must be treated within the first six hours, but I\u2019m seeing him two weeks later, and it\u2019s already too late.\u201d",
      "It is a common problem in the country of about 23 million people, which has just 70 ophthalmologists.",
      "Yam\u00e9ogo , who started her practice late last year, said the work is daunting and often requires her to visit \u2014 at no cost \u2014 families who cannot afford care or cannot make their way to the hospital where she works.",
      "While there is limited data available on eye defects in children in Burkina Faso or in Africa at large, an estimated 450 million children globally have a sight problem that needs treatment, according to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.",
      "Late intervention can significantly alter a child\u2019s future, the organization said, with many such cases in less developed countries.",
      "In Burkina Faso, an estimated 70% of the population lives in rural areas. And yet ophthalmologists are concentrated in the capital, Ouagadougou, and other main cities, making them unreachable for many.",
      "While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed in Burkina Faso\u2019s western Hauts-Bassins region in 2024, only 52 of those were carried out in its more rural areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Most procedures were done in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second city.",

      "To visit Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s hospital from the village where they are sheltering, they had to travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles) on a motorcycle to Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13) on transport, a high price for a small-scale farming family.",
      "At least 70% of the trauma cases in children treated at the hospital come from rural areas where the risk of exposure \u2014 from conflict or from play \u2014 is higher, Yam\u00e9ogo said.",
      "Examining and treating a child is a delicate practice that requires a lot of time, something many families can\u2019t afford. Many must return home to earn money for the treatment.",

      "\u201cSometimes I feel a pinch in my heart,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said as she examined the boy after they arrived from their farm on the outskirts of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cHis iris has detached from his cornea, so he needs to be hospitalized.\u201d",
      "The father, looking overwhelmed, sighed, unsure of where the money for the child's surgery would come. On paper, Burkina Faso's government covers the cost of medications and care for children under 5, but often no drugs are available in hospitals, meaning families must buy them elsewhere.",
      "A surgery like the one for Traor\u00e9 can cost 100,000 CFA ($179), several months' income for the family.",

      "The United States says it has sent five men to the small African nation of Eswatini in an expansion of the Trump administration\u2019s third-country deportation program",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The United States sent five men it describes as \u201cbarbaric\u201d criminals to the small African nation of Eswatini in an expansion of the Trump administration's largely secretive third-country deportation program, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has already deported eight men to another African country, South Sudan, after the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on sending people to countries where they have no ties. The South Sudanese government has declined to say where those men, also described as violent criminals, are after it took custody of them nearly two weeks ago.",
      "In a late-night post on X, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the men sent to Eswatini, who are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos, had arrived on a plane, but didn't say when or where.",
      "She said they were all convicted criminals and \u201cindividuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.\u201d",
      "The men \u201chave been terrorizing American communities\" but were now \"off of American soil,\u201d McLaughlin added.",
      "McLaughlin said they had been convicted of crimes including murder and child rape and one was a \"confirmed\" gang member. Her social media posts included mug shots of the men and what she said were their criminal records. They were not named.",
      "Like in South Sudan, there was no immediate comment from Eswatini authorities over any deal to accept third-country deportees or what would happen to them in that country. Civic groups there raised concerns over the secrecy from a government long accused of clamping down on human rights.",
      "\u201cThere has been a notable lack of official communication from the Eswatini government regarding any agreement or understanding with the U.S. to accept these deportees,\u201d Ingiphile Dlamini, a spokesperson for the pro-democracy group SWALIMO, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cThis opacity makes it difficult for civic society to understand the implications.\"",
      "It wasn't clear if they were being held in a detention center, what their legal status was or what Eswatini's plans were for the deported men, he said.",
      "Eswatini, previously called Swaziland, is a country of about 1.2 million people between South Africa and Mozambique. It is one of the world\u2019s last remaining absolute monarchies and the last in Africa. King Mswati III has ruled by decree since 1986.",
      "Political parties are effectively banned and pro-democracy groups have said for years that Mswati III has crushed political dissent, sometimes violently. Groups like SWALIMO have called for democratic reforms.",
      "Pro-democracy protests erupted in Eswatini in 2021, when dozens were killed, allegedly by security forces. Eswatini authorities have been accused of conducting political assassinations of pro-democracy activists and imprisoning others.",
      "Because Eswatini is a poor country with a relative lack of resources, it \u201cmay face significant strain in accommodating and managing individuals with complex backgrounds, particularly those with serious criminal convictions,\u201d Dlamini said.",
      "While the U.S. administration has hailed deportations as a victory for the safety and security of the American people, Dlamini said his organization wanted to know the plans for the five men sent to Eswatini and \u201cany potential risks to the local population.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said it is seeking more deals with African nations to take deportees from the U.S. Leaders from some of the five West African nations who met last week with President Donald Trump at the White House said the issue of migration and their countries possibly taking deportees from the U.S. was discussed.",
      "Some nations have pushed back. Nigeria, which wasn't part of that White House summit, said it has rejected pressure from the U.S. to take deportees who are citizens of other countries.",
      "The U.S. also has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, but has identified Africa as a continent where it might find more governments willing to strike deportation agreements.",
      "Rwanda\u2019s foreign minister told the AP last month that talks were underway with the U.S. about a potential agreement to host deported migrants. A British government plan announced in 2022 to deport rejected asylum-seekers to Rwanda was ruled illegal by the U.K. Supreme Court last year.",
      "The eight men deported by the U.S. to war-torn South Sudan, where they arrived early this month, previously spent weeks at a U.S. military base in nearby Djibouti, located on the northeast border of Ethiopia, as the case over the legality of sending them there played out.",
      "The South Sudanese government has not released details of its agreement with the U.S. to take deportees, nor has it said what will happen to the men. A prominent civil society leader there said South Sudan was \"not a dumping ground for criminals.\u201d",

      "Watira, who seeks a seat in Uganda's Parliament, remembered the recent event as a vivid example of the rampant fear of witchcraft as politicians seeking office try to outmaneuver each other in this east African country.",
      "In public, political contests often entail spectacles where rivals rent cars to mount raucous processions in the streets, offering cash and other inducements to voters. Behind the scenes, the struggle for victory can be intensely spiritual, with faith figuring in incidents ranging from ritual sacrifice to visits with traditional healers, according to Watira and others who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "Watira, a leader of a group uniting Uganda\u2019s Bamasaba people, said the incumbent legislator who refused to shake his hand may have worried that would somehow give Watira the upper hand or provoke misfortune. Watira said he wasn't surprised by the man\u2019s behavior.",

      "Spiritual warfare among politicians is part of a wider struggle over faith in Uganda, where Christianity is the dominant religion. Many who regularly attend church also secretly visit traditional shrines for the occult service they believe can lead them to victory.",
      "The syncretism has long confounded church leaders who teach that Christianity is incompatible with any vestiges of traditional religion, which remains widely practiced across sub-Saharan Africa.",

There's widespread belief that the superstition fuels Machar\u2019s quest for power in South Sudan, which has been wracked by war since independence in 2011 as Machar tried to remove President Salva Kiir.",
      "In Kenya, some of the anti-government protesters who gathered last month in the capital, Nairobi, said the disorientation they felt while nearing the presidential residence was likely an evil spell in favor of President William Ruto. He also faces criticism for building a church within the statehouse compound that some critics see as an ominous shrine.",

Some of these practitioners prefer to be described as traditional healers.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ultimatum to Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine within 50 days or face bruising sanctions has given the Kremlin extra time to pursue its summer offensive",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ultimatum to Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine within 50 days or face bruising sanctions on its energy exports has given the Kremlin extra time to pursue its summer offensive.",
      "The dogged Ukrainian resistance, however, makes it unlikely that the Russian military will make any quick gains.",
      "President Vladimir Putin has declared repeatedly that any peace deal should see Ukraine withdraw from the four regions that Russia illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured. He also wants Ukraine to renounce its bid to join NATO and accept strict limits on its armed forces -\u2013 demands Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected.",
      "A chronic shortage of manpower and ammunition has forced Ukrainian forces to focus on holding ground rather than launching counteroffensives.",
      "But despite a renewed Russian push \u2014 and an onslaught of aerial attacks on Kyiv and other cities in recent weeks \u2014 Ukrainian officials and analysts say it remains unlikely that Moscow can achieve any territorial breakthrough significant enough in 50 days to force Ukraine into accepting the Kremlin's terms anytime soon.",
      "Since spring, Russian troops have accelerated their land gains, capturing the most territory in eastern Ukraine since the opening stages of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "Russian forces are closing in on the eastern strongholds of Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region, methodically capturing villages near both cities to try to cut key supply routes and envelop their defenders \u2014 a slow offensive that has unfolded for months.",
      "Capturing those strongholds would allow Russia to push toward Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, setting the stage for the seizure of the entire Donetsk region.",
      "If Russian troops seize those last strongholds, it would open the way for them to forge westward to the Dnipropetrovsk region. The regional capital of Dnipro, a major industrial hub of nearly 1 million, is about 150 kilometers (just over 90 miles) west of Russian positions.",
      "The spread of fighting to Dnipropetrovsk could damage Ukrainian morale and give the Kremlin more leverage in any negotiations.",
      "In the neighboring Luhansk region, Ukrainian troops control a small sliver of land, but Moscow has not seemed to prioritize its capture.",
      "The other two Moscow-annexed regions \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2014 seem far from being totally overtaken by Russia.",
      "Early in the war, Russia quickly overran the Kherson region but was pushed back by Ukrainian forces from large swaths of it in November 2022, and retreated to the eastern bank of the Dnieper River. A new attempt to cross the waterway to seize the rest of the region would involve massive challenges, and Moscow doesn\u2019t seem to have the capability to mount such an operation.",
      "Fully capturing the Zaporizhzhia region appears equally challenging.",
      "Moscow\u2019s forces captured several villages in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy region after reclaiming chunks of Russia\u2019s Kursk region from Ukrainian troops who staged a surprise incursion in August 2024. Ukraine says its forces have stopped Russia's offensive and maintain a presence on the fringe of the Kursk region, where they are still tying down as many as 10,000 Russian troops.",
      "Putin recently described the offensive into the Sumy region as part of efforts to carve a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d to protect Russian territory from Ukrainian attacks.",
      "The regional capital of Sumy, a city of 268,000, is about 30 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from the border. Putin said Moscow doesn\u2019t plan to capture the city for now but doesn\u2019t exclude it.",
      "Military analysts, however, say Russian forces in the area clearly lack the strength to capture it.",
      "Russian forces also have pushed an offensive in the neighboring Kharkiv region, but they haven't made much progress against fierce Ukrainian resistance.",
      "Some commentators say Russia may hope to use its gains in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions as bargaining chips in negotiations, trading them for parts of the Donetsk region under Ukrainian control.",
      "\u201cA scenario of territorial swaps as part of the talks is quite realistic,\u201d said Mikhail Karyagin, a Kremlin-friendly political expert, in a commentary,",
      "Ukrainian commanders say the scale and pace of Russian operations suggest that any game-changing gains are out of reach, with Moscow\u2019s troops advancing slowly at a tremendous cost to its own forces.",
      "While exhausted Ukrainian forces are feeling outnumbered and outgunned, they are relying on drones to stymie Moscow's slow offensive. Significant movements of troops and weapons are easily spotted by drones that are so prolific that both sides use them to track and attack even individual soldiers within minutes.",
      "Russian military commentators recognize that Ukraine\u2019s drone proficiency makes any quick gains by Moscow unlikely. They say Russia aims to bleed Ukraine dry with a strategy of \u201ca thousand cuts,\u201d using relentless pressure on many sectors of the front and steadily increasing long-range aerial attacks against key infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe Russian army aims to exhaust the enemy to such an extent that it will not be able to hold the defense, and make multiple advances merge into one or several successes on a strategic scale that will determine the outcome of the war,\u201d Moscow-based military analyst Sergei Poletayev wrote in an analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s not that important where and at what speed to advance: the target is not the capture of this or that line; the target is the enemy army as such.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian troops on the front express exasperation and anger about delays and uncertainty about U.S. weapons shipments.",
      "Delays in U.S. military assistance have forced Kyiv's troops to ration ammunition and scale back operations as Russia intensifies its attacks, Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine told The Associated Press.",
      "The United States will sell weapons to its NATO allies in Europe so they can provide them to Ukraine, according to Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Included are Patriot air defense systems, a top priority for Ukraine.",
      "Speeded-up weapons shipments from European allies are crucial to allowing Ukraine to stem the Russian attacks, according to analysts.",
      "\u201cThe rate of Russian advance is accelerating, and Russia\u2019s summer offensive is likely to put the armed forces of Ukraine under intense pressure,\u201d Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute in London said in a commentary.",
      "But most of the capabilities that Ukraine needs \u2014 from drones to artillery systems \u2014 can be provided by NATO allies in Europe, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the short-term, Europe can cover most of Ukraine\u2019s needs so long as it can purchase some critical weapons types from the U.S.,\u201d Watling said.",

      "After three decades of conflict in the previous century, remnants of war littered approximately 4,500 square kilometers (about 1,737 square miles) of Cambodian land, according to a survey by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) in 2004. This affected all 25 Cambodian provinces and nearly half of the country\u2019s 14,000 villages.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Police fear Bradley John Murdoch, known as the \u201cOutback Killer\u201d, has taken to his grave the secret of how he disposed of the body of British backpacker Peter Falconio who was murdered in arid central Australia 24 years ago.",
      "Murdoch died Tuesday night, aged 67, in the palliative care unit of the Alice Springs Hospital, officials said Wednesday. He was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was recently transferred to the hospital from the Alice Springs prison.",
      "His death leaves the mystery of the whereabouts of Falconio\u2019s body unsolved.",
      "The Northern Territory Police Force said investigators remain \"committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio\u2019s remains,\" a police statement said. \u201cHis silence has denied the Falconio family the closure they have so long deserved.\"",
      "The victim's 83-year-old father, Luciano Falconio, was visibly shocked and lost for words after learning of Murdoch's death a day after the anniversary of his son's disappearance, News Corp Australia reported.",
      "\u201cI tell you what I think, I wish he (Murdoch) left something for me to find him,\u201d the father told the news company from his home in the U.K.",
      "In 2005, Murdoch was convicted of the 2001 murder of 28-year-old Falconio, from Huddersfield in England\u2019s Yorkshire region, and the attempted kidnapping of Falconio\u2019s girlfriend Joanne Lees.",
      "The crime captured global attention and was one of the inspirations for the 2005 Australian horror movie \u201cWolf Creek,\u201d about a serial killer who preyed on backpackers and left a single witness who became a suspect.",
      "Lees, who wrote about her ordeal in her 2006 memoir \u201cNo Turning Back,\u201d complained that police treated her as a suspect in the years before Murdoch was charged.",
      "A court order prevented the movie\u2019s release in the Northern Territory during Murdoch\u2019s trial, fearing it could influence jurors. Murdoch was not accused of any other killings.",
      "Murdoch consistently maintained his innocence and did not help authorities search for Falconio\u2019s remains.",
      "At the time of the killing, Murdoch was an interstate drug runner, using amphetamines to stay awake for dayslong drives and cannabis to sleep.",
      "On the night of July 14, 2001, he tricked Falconio and Lees into stopping their campervan on a dark and remote highway north of Alice Springs.",
      "Lees watched her boyfriend leave the van to inspect a supposedly sparking exhaust pipe. She testified that she heard a gunshot and never saw her boyfriend again.",
      "Murdoch, an imposing 193 centimeters (6 foot, 4 inches) in height, bound her wrists with cable ties before she managed to escape and hid in the desert scrub for hours. She testified she watched Murdoch searching for her with a flashlight and his dog.",
      "Lees later waved down a truck and raised the alarm.",
      "Last month, police doubled the reward for information leading to the location of Falconio\u2019s remains to 500,000 Australian dollars ($330,000), following news that Murdoch was in palliative care.",
      "\u201cPolice still hold out hope that someone may be able to provide some vital information to assist in this search,\u201d Police Commander Mark Grieve said.",
      "Colleen Gwynne, a former police officer who led the investigation at the time of Falconio's disappearance, said Murdoch might have panicked after Lees escaped and in his confusion forgot what he did with the body.",
      "\u201cOnce that panic set in \u2026 he may have disposed of a body somewhere he\u2019s not entirely certain where that is,\u201d Gwynne said earlier this month.",
      "Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for Falconio\u2019s murder and was ordered to serve at least 28 years before he could be considered for parole. He was also sentenced to six years for assaulting Lees.",
      "The earliest he could have applied for parole would have been 2032, but without providing information as to what he had done with Falconio\u2019s body, Murdoch was not likely to have been released. The territory passed laws in 2016 preventing prisoners convicted of murder from qualifying for parole unless they provide police with the location of their victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "Murdoch was born in the west coast town of Geraldton, the third child of an automobile mechanic and his wife, a hairdresser.",
      "As a teen, he became involved in biker gang crime and was first sentenced to prison in 1995 for shooting at a group of Indigenous people at Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. He served 15 months of a 21-month sentence.",
      "In sentencing Murdoch for Falconio\u2019s killing, Chief Justice Brian Martin said he doubted any words could express the trauma and terror Lees had suffered.",
      "\u201cIt must have been close to the worst nightmare imaginable,\u201d the judge said.",

      "Cuba\u2019s Labor Minister Marta Elena Feit\u00f3 Cabrera faces backlash after controversial comments she made about poverty in the island nation",
      "HAVANA -- A Cuban minister sparked criticism Tuesday, including from the president, after saying that there are no beggars in Cuba, only people disguised as such, and suggesting that those who clean windshields at crossroads have an \u201ceasy\u201d life.",
      "Cuba\u2019s Minister of Labor and Social Security, Marta Elena Feit\u00f3 Cabrera, made the comments on Monday before deputies in a National Assembly committee. They went viral, prompting calls for Feit\u00f3s' impeachment and a wave of criticism in a country experiencing a tough economic situation in recent years.",
      "The economic crisis in Cuba has increased social vulnerability and led to unusual scenes for the island, such as people \u2014 especially the elderly \u2014 begging or scavenging through garbage, or some cleaning windshields at corners.",
      "\u201cWe have seen people, apparently beggars, (but) when you look at their hands, look at the clothes these people are wearing, they are disguised as beggars, they are not beggars,\" Feit\u00f3 said before the National Assembly committee. \"In Cuba there are no beggars.\u201d",
      "She added that people cleaning windshields use the money to \u201cdrink alcohol.\u201d",
      "Feit\u00f3 also lashed out against those who search through the garbage dumps. She said they are recovering materials \u201cto resell and not pay tax.\u201d",
      "Without mentioning her name, but referring to the meeting at the National Assembly committee where Feit\u00f3 participated, President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel said on his X account: \u201cthe lack of sensitivity in addressing vulnerability is highly questionable. The revolution cannot leave anyone behind; that is our motto, our militant responsibility.\u201d",
      "Until a few years ago, despite the poverty, there were no signs of begging or homelessness on the island thanks to benefits that have now been greatly reduced.",
      "The pension of a retiree is about 2,000 Cuban pesos per month, roughly $5 on the informal market, and just under the cost of a carton of eggs. For those who don\u2019t receive remittances from family abroad, it means going hungry.",
      "Self-employed Enrique Guill\u00e9n believes the minister is wrong and that some people do not see the situation clearly, and hopes the government will take action.",
      "\u201cThey are elderly people who count on a pension that does not exist. They cannot even buy a carton of eggs. It is the reality we are living in Cuba,\u201d Guill\u00e9n said.",

      "France\u2019s prime minister has proposed cutting two public holidays to save money in next year\u2019s budget",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s prime minister proposed on Tuesday the elimination of two public holidays from the country\u2019s annual calendar \u2014 possibly Easter Monday and the day marking the Allied victory over the Nazis \u2014 to save money in next year\u2019s budget.",
      "That's among a raft of spending cuts laid out by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in a sweeping, and potentially doomed, budget plan. He argued that removing two state holidays would bring in tax revenues generated from economic activity, contributing to around 44 billion euros ($51.3 billion) in overall savings.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron tasked Bayrou with crafting a budget that shaves costs to bring down France\u2019s staggering debt and deficit \u2014 while also adding billions in new defense spending to face what Macron says are resurgent threats from Russia and beyond.",
      "Bayrou questioned the religious importance of Easter Monday. And Victory Day, celebrated on May 8, comes in a month that has become a \u201cveritable Gruyere,\u201d or holey cheese, of days off that includes May Day and the Catholic holiday of Ascension, he said.",
      "He said that those holidays were just suggestions, and that he was open to other ideas. France currently has 11 official holidays per year.",
      "With no parliamentary majority, Macron\u2019s centrist grouping must win support from adversaries on the left and right to pass the budget this fall. Bayrou's proposals, which are just a first step in the budget process, were quickly assailed by unions and the far-right National Rally, the largest single party in the lower house of Parliament.",
      "Bayrou\u2019s job is precarious, and he could be voted out if he fails to reach compromise on the budget.",

      "MAGALIESBURG, South Africa -- Five vultures that were rescued and rehabilitated by a conservation group have been released back into the wild on a mountain range in South Africa.",
      "Two of the Cape Vultures were rescued from the illegal wildlife trade, where the birds' body parts are sought after for potions and charms. One of them had all its feathers removed and the Vulpro vulture conservation group looked after it for nearly a year while they grew back.",
      "Two of the other vultures were injured in the wild. One was saved after it landed in a dam and became waterlogged and was unable to fly, conservationists said.",
      "The birds were set free on the Magaliesburg Mountains in northern South Africa, where there is an existing vulture colony.",
      "Vultures generally aren't well-loved because of their appearance and because they feed entirely on carrion \u2014 or dead animal carcasses \u2014 and are often associated with death.",
      "But conservationists say these scavengers are critical for cleaning up ecosystems and preventing animal and human disease outbreaks.",

      "Brazil\u2019s chief prosecutor has recommended a guilty verdict in the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of leading a coup plot that sought to overturn the 2022 election result",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil\u2019s chief prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict in the case of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial accused of leading an alleged coup plot.",
      "\u201cThe evidence is clear: the defendant acted systematically, throughout his mandate and after his defeat at the polls, to incite insurrection and the destabilization of the democratic rule of law,\u201d Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet said in a 517-long page document released late on Monday.",
      "Bolsonaro is accused of seeking to overturn the 2022 election in which he was defeated by a left-wing rival.",
      "\u201cAll the accusations are false. I never violated democracy or the constitution,\u201d Bolsonaro said on X hours before Gonet submitted his final allegations. He said the trial was a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d echoing a term used by U.S. President Donald Trump when he came to his South American ally\u2019s defense last week.",
      "The prosecution accuses Bolsonaro of leading an armed criminal organization, attempting to stage a coup and attempting violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.",
      "The defence will present its case shortly. Then the panel of Supreme Court justices that opened a trial against the former president will vote on whether to convict or acquit him. Experts expect that to happen in the second half of the year.",
      "A coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. A conviction on that and other charges could bring decades behind bars.",
      "The former president has repeatedly denied the allegations and asserted that he is the target of political persecution.",
      "A lawyer for Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump last week imposed a 50% import tax on Brazil, directly tying the tariffs to Bolsonaro's trial. The U.S. president has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.",
      "Trump said that Brazil \u201cis doing a terrible thing in their treatment\u201d of Bolsonaro. He added that Bolsonaro \u201cis not guilty of anything, except for having fought for the people,\u201d and compared the Brazilian\u2019s situation to his own.",
      "Gonet formally charged Bolsonaro and 33 others in February in connection with an alleged coup days after President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva took office.",
      "Gonet said Bolsonaro's actions \u201cwere not limited to a passive stance of resistance to defeat, but were a conscious effort to create an environment conducive to violence and a coup.\u201d He added that \u201cthe criminal organization documented almost all of the actions described in the indictment through recordings, handwritten notes, digital files, spreadsheets, and exchanges of electronic messages.\u201d",
      "The prosecution is also seeking convictions for several close allies of Bolsonaro, including his running mate during the 2022 election and former defense minister, Walter Braga Netto, ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court president, Justice Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, said the U.S. \u201csanctions\u201d \u2014 a reference to Trump's tariffs \u2014 are based on \u201can inaccurate understanding\u201d of events.",
      "\u201cFor those who didn\u2019t live through a dictatorship or don\u2019t remember one, it\u2019s worth remembering: there was a lack of freedom, torture, forced disappearances, the closure of Congress, and the persecution of judges. In today\u2019s Brazil, no one is persecuted,\u201d Barroso said.",
      "Bolsonaro, a former military officer who was known to express nostalgia for the country\u2019s past dictatorship, openly defied Brazil\u2019s judicial system during his 2019-2022 term in office.",
      "He has been banned by Brazil\u2019s top electoral court from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.",

      "Wilawan Emsawat, in her mid-30s, was arrested at her home in Nonthaburi province north of the capital Bangkok on charges including extortion, money laundering and receiving stolen goods. Police said they traced money transferred to her by a senior monk from a bank account belonging to his temple in northern Thailand.",
      "Wilawan has not made a statement since her arrest and it was unclear if she has legal representation. Speaking to local media before her arrest, she acknowledged one relationship and said she had given money to that monk.",
      "Scandalsinvolving monks surface a few times a year in Thailand but usually don\u2019t involve senior members of the clergy. The case also puts a spotlight on the large sums of money donated to temples controlled by abbots, which is in marked contrast to the abstemious lives they are supposed to lead under their religion\u2019s precepts.",
      "Wilawan deliberately targeted senior monks for financial gain, police said, noting they found several monks had transferred large amounts of money after Wilawan initiated romantic relationships with them.",
      "Wilawan\u2019s bank accounts received around 385 million baht ($11.9 million) in the past three years, but most of the funds were spent on online gambling websites, police said.",
      "Jaroonkiat Pankaew, a Central Investigation Bureau deputy commissioner, said the investigation began last month after an abbot of a famous temple in Bangkok abruptly left the monkhood.",
      "Investigators found the abbot had allegedly been blackmailed by Wilawan over their romantic relationship. She told the monk that she was pregnant and asked him to pay 7.2 million baht ($222,000) in financial assistance, Jaroonkiat said at a news conference in Bangkok Tuesday.",
      "Police believed \u201cthis woman is dangerous and we needed to arrest her as soon as possible,\u201d Jaroonkiat said.",
      "Thai media reported a search of her mobile phones revealed tens of thousands of photos and videos, as well as numerous chat logs indicating intimacy with several monks, many of which could be used for blackmail.",
      "Thai monks are largely members of the Theravada sect, which requires them to be celibate and refrain from even touching a woman.",
      "Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai ordered authorities to review and consider tightening existing laws related to monks and temples, especially the transparency of temple finances, to restore faith in Buddhism, government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said Tuesday.",
      "The Central Investigation Bureau has set up a Facebook page for people to report monks who misbehave, Jaroonkiat said.",
      "\u201cWe will investigate monks across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that the ripple effects of this investigation will lead to a lot of changes.\u201d",

      "In a document sent to the legislature, transport officials said those companies applying for a license would need to have business registration and an office in the city. They also said the platforms would have to fulfill certain conditions on operating experience, proof of financial capability and capital investment, in addition to ensuring the cars and drivers working for them already purchased the required insurance.",
      "Under the licensing plans, eligible drivers must have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. The drivers also need to pass a test and complete training.",
      "Officials plan to set a quota on the number of vehicles allowed to be run under the policy, adding that the cars cannot be over seven years old and have to pass an annual inspection.",
      "Currently, it is illegal for drivers of private vehicles to provide paid services to customers without a permit. Police have arrested some Uber drivers suspected of driving without a permit in the past and in 2018, more than two dozen drivers were fined.",
      "Uber, which started operating in Hong Kong in 2014, has faced multiple legal and regulatory challenges in its overseas expansion but remains popular in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, where many residents are frustrated with poor taxi services.",
      "Some taxi companies have long resisted online platforms like Uber, seeing them as a threat to their business.",

      "\u201cI agree the problem is complicated but it should not be further delayed,\u201d he said.",
      "In the document, the government said it would consider charging the platforms fees to provide resources for supporting the taxi industry in improving its service quality. It also suggested the companies allow taxi drivers to offer services through their platforms.",

      "Located in the Bandra-Kurla Complex, an upscale business center in the financial capital Mumbai, the showroom will serve as Tesla\u2019s flagship retail and experience outlet as the company introduces its EV lineup to Indian customers.",
      "Tesla\u2019s entry to India comes after years of delays and policy friction, marking a pivotal expansion in a fast-growing consumer base while global sales are plunging and the company faces challenges in its two core markets, China and the U.S.",
      "Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply from April to June as boycotts over Elon Musk\u2019s political views continued keeping buyers away.",

      "The country\u2019s nascent electric vehicle market made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.",

      "Tesla pressed Indian authorities to cut import taxes on EVs, which were up to 100%, to be able to test the local market. New Delhi, however, wanted Tesla to set up manufacturing facilities so a comprehensive policy could benefit all the players in the sector.",
      "The dynamics changed after Modi and Musk met in the U.S. in February during a state visit by Modi.",
      "Barely a month later, India rolled out a new policy to woo the likes of Tesla, reducing import taxes to 15% from 70% to 100% for EVs priced cheaper than $35,000 as long the automaker committed to building a factory in the country within three years.",
      "Soon after, Musk announced he would visit India in April to meet Modi. It was widely expected he would unveil Tesla\u2019s plans to set up manufacturing facilities and commit billions of dollars in investments. But Musk cancelled the visit, citing \u201cvery heavy Tesla obligations,\u201d and travelled to China instead.",

    "story": [
      "A music festival in Utsjoki, Finland, brings S\u00e1mi culture to the spotlight under the midnight sun",
      "UTSJOKI, Finland -- It was well past midnight when Mihkku Laiti appeared on stage to perform at an open-air music festival in the Finnish village of Utsjoki, north of the Arctic circle.",
      "Despite the time, Lapland\u2019s famous midnight sun was still up. During the summer months the sun doesn\u2019t go down at all in Utsjoki, which is less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Arctic Ocean.",
      "In the glow of blue spotlights, Laiti rapped while a crowd of more than 300 listened, some of them singing along and dancing. Like the majority of Utsjoki\u2019s residents, Laiti is a member of the S\u00e1mi \u2014 Europe's only recognized Indigenous people \u2014 and he rapped in his native S\u00e1mi language.",
      "Laiti, also known by his stage name \u201cYungmiqu,\u201d is the founder of the Loktafeasta rap festival. He first found fame on the television show Talent Finland, where he surprised the judges by rapping in the g\u00e1kti, the traditional dress of the S\u00e1mi. It is brightly colored and often characterized by plaits, pewter embroidery and a high collar.",
      "The festival brought Laiti\u2019s Indigenous culture to the spotlight, though some of his fans could not understand what he was saying. That didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone at the Loktafeasta as the festival mixed performances from artists in both S\u00e1mi language and Finnish.",
      "Some drank beer and ate sausages and the crowd seemed to enjoy the summer festival atmosphere despite spells of rain.",
      "\u201cWhen I rap about my culture ... I want to show how being S\u00e1mi is like from my point of view,\" Laiti told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cBecause there are many stereotypes about S\u00e1mi people and I want to like normalize ... the basic stuff we do and not romanticize those things,\u201d he said. He added that he has not worn the g\u00e1kti for performances for about a year now to show people that it is possible to be S\u00e1mi and wear whatever you want.",
      "The S\u00e1mi traditionally live in Lapland, which stretches from northern parts of Norway to Sweden and Finland to Russia. However, of the roughly 10,000 S\u00e1mi people living in Finland, the majority now live outside their homeland.",
      "The S\u00e1mi people were oppressed for centuries by the powers that ruled and exploited their lands, including bans of the use of their native tongues and efforts to suppress their culture. In the past decades, there have been efforts to reestablish their rights, including the right to use S\u00e1mi languages which is now guaranteed in the Finnish constitution.",
      "Today, the historically semi-nomadic S\u00e1mi people have modern lifestyles. The few who still tend reindeer do so with modern vehicles, digital tools and regulated land use.",
      "However, there is an effort to preserve the S\u00e1mi's cultural identity. Distinctive S\u00e1mi clothing was worn by many at Loktafeasta, as is typical on special occasions.",
      "At the festival, Laiti mostly wanted his fans to be happy and enjoy the music.",
      "\u201cI want people to feel joy, of course, and I just want people to be happy that we have this kind of festival here in Utsjoki,\" he said with a smile.",
      "Among the other acts was a duo comprised of self-confessed old school tango crooner Jaakko Laitinen and rapper Jouni J. They also reside in Lapland and perform in Finnish.",
      "\u201cI see a connection from the hip hop and the tinkering with words to the old Finnish like Kalevala freestyling folk poetry,\" said Laitinen, referring to Finland's national epic about the Earth's creation.",
      "\"So that obvious connection and the Finnish tango ... is part of our soul and heart,\u201d he added.",
      "Although the duo\u2019s songs were a world away from the birthplace of rap music in the Bronx in New York City, their performance brought joy to Utsjoki's locals and visitors.",
      "\u201cMusic travels and music brings people together. It\u2019s the magic of the international language of music,\u201d Laitinen said.",

      "The boat was carrying 16 passengers, mostly local administration officials, and two crew members. The 11 people missing included three children and a local parliamentarian.",

      "Bangladesh was at the precipice of charting a new beginning last year after its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed from power in a student-led uprising",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh was on the cusp of charting a new beginning last year after its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed from power in a student-led uprising, ending her 15-year rule and forcing her to flee to India.",
      "As the head of a new interim government, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus promised to hold a credible election to return to democracy, initiate electoral and constitutional reforms and restore peace on the streets after hundreds were killed in weeks of violence that began on July 15, 2024.",
      "A year later, the Yunus-led administration has struggled to contain the fallout of the uprising. Bangladesh finds itself mired in a growing political uncertainty, religious polarization and a challenging law-and-order situation.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Bangladesh a year after the protests that toppled Hasina.",
      "Uncertainty about the future of democracy looms large in Bangladesh.",
      "The student protesters who toppled Hasina formed a new political party, promising to break the overwhelming influence of two major dynastic political parties \u2014 the Bangladesh Nationalists Party, or BNP, and Hasina\u2019s Awami League.",
      "But the party's opponents have accused it of being close to the Yunus-led administration and creating chaos for political mileage by using state institutions.",
      "Meanwhile, Bangladesh's political landscape has further fragmented after the country\u2019s largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, returned to politics more than a decade after it was suppressed by Hasina\u2019s government.",
      "Aligned with the student-led party, it's trying to fill the vacuum left by the Awami League, which was banned in May. Its leader, Hasina, is facing trial for crimes against humanity. The strength of Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971, is unknown.",
      "Both BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami party are now at loggerheads over establishing supremacy within the administration and judiciary, and even university campuses.",
      "They are also differing over the timing of a new parliamentary election. Yunus has announced that the polls would be held in April next year, but poor law and order situation and a lack of clear-cut political consensus over it have created confusion. The chief of Bangladesh's military also wanted an election in December this year \u2014 a stance Yunus didn't like.",
      "\u201cPost-revolution honeymoons often don\u2019t last long, and Bangladesh is no exception,\u201d says Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and senior fellow of Asia Pacific Foundation. \u201cThe interim government faced massive expectations to restore democracy and prosperity. But this is especially difficult to do as an unelected government without a public mandate.\"",
      "Yunus has delayed an election because he wants reforms \u2014 from changes to the constitution and elections to the judiciary and police. Discussions with political parties, except Hasina's Awami League, are ongoing.",
      "Some of the reforms include putting a limit on how many times a person can become the prime minister, introduction of a two-tier parliament, and appointment of a chief justice.",
      "There appears to be little consensus over some basic reforms. While both the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami parties have agreed to some of them with conditions, other proposals for basic constitutional reforms have become a sticking point.",
      "The Jamaat-e-Islami also wants to give the interim government more time to complete reforms before heading into polls, while BNP has been calling for an early election. The student-led party mostly follows the pattern of the Jamaat-e-Islami party.",
      "Kugelman says the issue of reforms was meant to unite the country, but has instead become a flashpoint.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a divide between those that want to see through reforms and give them more time, and those that feel it\u2019s time to wrap things up and focus on elections,\u201d he says.",
      "Human rights in Bangladesh have remained a serious concern under Yunus.",
      "Minority groups, especially Hindus, have blamed his administration for failing to protect them adequately. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council says minority Hindus and others have been targeted in hundreds of attacks over the last year. Hasina\u2019s party has also blamed the interim government for arresting tens of thousands of its supporters.",
      "The Yunus-led administration denies these allegations.",
      "Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, says while the interim government has stopped enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions that had occurred under the Hasina government, \u201cthere has been little progress on lasting security sector reforms or to deliver on the pledge to create robust, independent institutions.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Islamist factions \u2014 some of whom have proposed changes to women\u2019s rights and demanded introduction of Sharia law \u2014 are vying for power. Many of them are planning to build alliances with bigger parties like the BNP or the Jamaat-e-Islami.",
      "Such factions have historically struggled to gain significant electoral support despite Bangladesh being a Muslim majority, and their rise is expected to further fragment the country's political landscape.",
      "During Hasina's 15-year rule, Bangladesh was India\u2019s closest partner in South Asia. After her ouster, the Yunus-led administration has moved closer to China, which is India\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "Yunus\u2019 first state visit was to China in March, a trip that saw him secure investments, loans and grants. On the other hand, India is angered by the ousting of its old ally Hasina and hasn't responded to Dhaka\u2019s requests to extradite her. India stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis following Hasina's fall.",
      "Globally, Yunus seems to have strong backing from the West and the United Nations, and it appears Bangladesh will continue its foreign policy, which has long tried to find a balance between multiple foreign powers.",
      "But Kugelman says the country's biggest challenge may be the \u201cTrump factor.\u201d",
      "In January, the Trump administration suspended USAID funds to Bangladesh, which had sought significant levels of U.S. support during a critical rebuild period post Hasina's ouster.",
      "\u201cDhaka must now reframe its relations with an unconventional U.S. administration that will largely view Bangladesh through a commercial lens,\u201d Kugelman says.",

      "Two men who cut down England\u2019s iconic Sycamore Gap tree have been sentenced to over four years in prison",
      "LONDON -- Vandals who cut down England\u2019s beloved Sycamore Gap tree were sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in prison for damaging the country's natural heritage and for the widespread outrage and distress it caused.",
      "Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers set out on a dark and stormy night in 2023 to carry out what a prosecutor called a \u201cmoronic mission,\u201d and toppled the majestic sycamore onto Hadrian\u2019s Wall.",
      "Graham, 39, and Carruthers, 32, were each convicted of two counts of criminal damage \u2014 one for destroying the tree, the other for damaging the ancient wall that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert sentenced the pair in Newcastle Crown Court to four years and three months in prison because there was a high degree of premeditation and planning to destroy the tree and because the act had angered and saddened so many people.",
      "Lambert concluded the two had largely done it for the \u201csheer bravado.\u201d",
      "\u201cFelling the tree in the middle of the night and in the middle of a storm gave you some sort of thrill,\u201d she said. \u201cYou reveled in the coverage, taking evident pride in what you had done, knowing that you were responsible for the crime which so many were talking about.\u201d",
      "Sarah Dodd, a lawyer specializing in tree law, said it was the first time in the U.K. that someone had been sentenced to prison for illegally felling a tree.",
      "\u201cToday felt profoundly sad. There are no winners,\u201d Dodd said. \u201cThe Sycamore Gap tree wasn\u2019t just wood and leaves. It was a marker of memory, history, belonging.\u201d",
      "The tree, perched in a saddle between two hills, had been known to locals for its scenic setting, but became famous after a cameo in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\u201d It drew tourists, lovers, landscape photographers and those who spread the ashes of loved ones. It was voted English \u201cTree of the Year\u201d in 2016.",
      "Some of the mystery behind the crime evaporated during the hearing.",
      "At trial, the two men testified they were at their respective homes on the night in question and had nothing to do with destroying the tree.",
      "But faced with spending up to 10 years behind bars, they recently changed their tunes when interviewed by a probation officer in advance of sentencing, though they sought to minimize their culpability, the judge said.",
      "Carruthers said he drank a bottle of whisky after a rough day and everything was a blur, Lambert said. While Graham admitted he had joined Carruthers on the journey, he said he was shocked that his former friend had actually cut the tree down.",
      "\u201cAlthough there may be grains of truth in what you have each said, I do not accept that your explanations to the probation officers are wholly honest or the whole story,\u201d Lambert said.",
      "The illegal felling in Northumberland National Park on Sept. 28, 2023, caused fury and condemnation as news quickly spread beyond the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire.",
      "\u201cThis iconic tree can never be replaced,\u201d Andrew Poad, general manager of the heritage and nature conservation charity National Trust, said in a statement read by a prosecutor. \u201cIt belonged to the people. It was a totemic symbol for many; a destination to visit whilst walking Hadrian\u2019s Wall, a place to make memories, take photos in all seasons; but it was also a place of sanctuary.\"",
      "Despite the denials by the defendants, jurors had quickly convicted them in May after prosecutors presented a case that relied heavily on digital evidence.",
      "Graham\u2019s Range Rover was tracked to a location near the tree around the time it fell. Grainy video of the felling was found on his phone \u2014 with metadata showing that it was shot at the location of the tree.",
      "As digital data showed Graham\u2019s vehicle on its way back to where the two lived about 40 minutes away, Carruthers got a text from his girlfriend with footage of their 12-day-old son.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got a better video than that,\u201d Carruthers replied.",
      "The black and white video showed a single figure next to the tree's prominent silhouette as the wind blew and a chainsaw sparked to life. The person leaned into the trunk and in less than three minutes the tree that had stood for about 150 years teetered and crashed to the ground.",
      "Prosecutors couldn\u2019t say at trial who cut down the tree and who memorialized the senseless act, but said both were equally culpable.",
      "Lambert agreed that both shared equal responsibility. But she said that the recent admissions of both men made it clear that Carruthers wielded the saw while Graham shot the video. Graham had sent the video to Carruthers.",
      "Carruthers will have to carry the burden for his actions like a \u201cform of personal penance,\u201d defense lawyer Andrew Gurney said.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it is no more than drunken stupidity,\" Gurney said. \u201cHe felled that tree and it is something he will regret for the rest of his life. There\u2019s no better explanation than that.\u201d",

CEO Jamie Dimon on Tuesday touted another strong performance by the bank, particularly its markets division, where revenue rose by 15% to $8.9 billion.",
      "JPMorgan earned an adjusted $5.24 per share in the period, beating the $4.48 analysts were calling for but down from last year\u2019s $6.12 per share. Excluding the one-time items, JPMorgan earned $4.96 per share in the period.",
      "Dimon said the U.S. economy remained resilient in the second quarter, highlighting tax reform and the potential for more deregulation. However, he noted that plenty of risks remain, including trade uncertainty, geopolitical conflicts and federal government deficits.",
      "\u201cThe finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook, however, significant risks persist \u2014 including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices,\u201d Dimon said in prepared remarks.",

      "Feit\u00f3 made the comments Monday before deputies in a National Assembly committee. The comments went viral, prompting calls for Feit\u00f3's impeachment and a wave of criticism in a country experiencing a tough economic situation in recent years.",
      "Even Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel was critical. Without mentioning her by name, but referring to the meeting at the National Assembly committee where Feit\u00f3 participated, D\u00edaz-Canel said on his X account: \u201cthe lack of sensitivity in addressing vulnerability is highly questionable. The revolution cannot leave anyone behind; that is our motto, our militant responsibility.\u201d",
      "The economic crisis in Cuba has increased social vulnerability and led to unusual scenes for the island, such as people \u2014 especially the elderly \u2014 begging or scavenging through garbage, or some cleaning windshields at corners.",
      "\u201cWe have seen people, apparently beggars, (but) when you look at their hands, look at the clothes these people are wearing, they are disguised as beggars, they are not beggars,\" Feit\u00f3 said before the National Assembly committee. \"In Cuba there are no beggars.\u201d",
      "She added that people cleaning windshields use the money to \u201cdrink alcohol.\u201d",
      "Feit\u00f3 also lashed out against those who search through the garbage dumps, saying they are recovering materials \u201cto resell and not pay tax.\u201d",
      "Until a few years ago, despite the poverty, there were no signs of begging or homelessness on the island thanks to benefits that have now been greatly reduced.",
      "The pension of a retiree is about 2,000 Cuban pesos per month, roughly $5 on the informal market, and just under the cost of a carton of eggs. For those who don\u2019t receive remittances from family abroad, it means going hungry.",
      "Self-employed Enrique Guill\u00e9n believes the minister is wrong and that some people do not see the situation clearly, and hopes the government will take action.",
      "\u201cThey are elderly people who count on a pension that does not exist. They cannot even buy a carton of eggs. It is the reality we are living in Cuba,\u201d Guill\u00e9n said.",
      "On Monday, island authorities reported that Cuba's gross domestic product fell by 1.1% in 2024, accumulating a decline of 11% over the past five years.",

    "story": [
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid and Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two strong choices for those willing to sacrifice some interior space, especially in the third row, for exceptional fuel economy and a lower price",
      "The 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid and 2025 Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two three-row SUVs with compelling attributes if you\u2019re shopping for a family-oriented vehicle. First, they\u2019re both hybrids and get excellent fuel economy. They\u2019re also smaller and less expensive than many other three-row SUVs, such as the Kia Telluride and Toyota Grand Highlander. Not everyone needs a giant vehicle with a third-row seat that can fit full-size adults \u2014 something for occasional use by bigger kids or teens can easily suffice.",
      "If any or all of that sounds like what you\u2019re looking for, the Sorento and Highlander hybrids should fit the bill. But which one should you buy? Edmunds\u2019 car experts have tested both to find out.",
      "We\u2019ve already indicated that the Sorento and Highlander have less third-row legroom than bigger three-row SUVs. They also have less cargo space when you raise their third-row seats. Of these two vehicles, the Highlander is bigger on the outside, although that doesn\u2019t entirely translate to a bigger interior. It\u2019s wider and comes standard with seating for six people. You can get a Highlander Hybrid with an optional second-row bench seat that increases capacity to seven.",
      "The Sorento Hybrid only comes with second-row captain\u2019s chairs and, as a result, it has a maximum six-passenger capacity. The Highlander can also fit slightly more stuff behind its third row \u2014 think an extra duffel or big grocery bag \u2014 and its advantage increases with each row lowered.",
      "On the other hand, the Sorento has slightly more third-row legroom and headroom. That\u2019s relative since only small people can fit in the way back of each. Indeed, the Highlander\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t that significant, and the Sorento\u2019s smaller exterior size is a benefit in terms of parking and maneuverability \u2014 two reasons one can contemplate this smaller three-row subset to begin with.",
      "Advantage: Toyota Highlander Hybrid",
      "The Sorento Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving in its standard front-wheel-drive configuration. Opting for all-wheel drive drops that slightly to 34 mpg combined. Every Highlander Hybrid has all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. You can pretty much consider this a tie.",
      "Performance differs, however. At the Edmunds test track, an all-wheel-drive Sorento Hybrid accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, which is a respectable time for a three-row hybrid SUV. It feels quick, too, thanks to the ample torque provided by the turbocharged engine and electric motor. It also has a six-speed automatic transmission that shifts quickly and smoothly. Having front-wheel drive standard is also nice as it lowers the cost of entry for those who don\u2019t need the winter-ready traction of all-wheel drive.",
      "The Highlander Hybrid went from zero to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds, which is slower than non-hybrid SUVs by about a second. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, but Toyota\u2019s more typical hybrid powertrain features a continuously variable automatic transmission that makes the engine drone under hard acceleration. That engine is also not turbocharged.",
      "Advantage: Kia Sorento Hybrid",
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid starts at $40,105, or about $8,000 less than the $48,315 Highlander Hybrid \u2014 adding all-wheel drive to the Kia only reduces the gap by $1,800. The Highlander does come with a few extra standard features to partially offset its higher price, but we don\u2019t think they fully justify the price premium. Moreover, the Highlander continues to be similarly more expensive when you compare each vehicle\u2019s more well-equipped trim levels.",
      "The Sorento also has a better infotainment system as standard, with a 10.25-inch touchscreen packing integrated navigation. The Highlander\u2019s standard unit is only 8 inches and lacks navigation. You can, however, add the 12.3-inch touchscreen that\u2019s standard on upper trims to the base trim as a stand-alone option. Feature content within the infotainment systems is comparable, but the Kia has multiple USB ports in each row whereas the Highlander has none in the third row. In terms of functionality, we score both the Toyota and Kia tech interfaces similarly strong in terms of usability.",
      "Safety technology content is similarly robust in both SUVs, but the Sorento\u2019s are superior in terms of performance, especially the adaptive cruise control system.",
      "Advantage: Kia",
      "The Sorento and Highlander hybrids are similar in concept, but our testing team ultimately scores the Kia higher. Moreover, the Toyota is so much more expensive regardless of trim level that it makes the Kia look like that much stronger of a choice.",

      "The Senate vote was 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.",

Mike Rounds, R-S.D., tweeted that he would vote to support the measure after working with the administration to \u201cfind Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.\u201d",
      "Some senators worried that the cuts to public media could decimate many of the 1,500 local radio and television stations around the country that rely on some federal funding to operate. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes more than 70% of its funding to those stations.",
      "Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was particularly concerned about a lack of specifics from the White House.",
      "\u201cThe rescissions package has a big problem \u2014 nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,\" Collins said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t because we haven\u2019t had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.\u201d",

      "Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that tens of millions of Americans rely on local public radio and television stations for local news, weather alerts and educational programs. He warned that many could lose access to that information because of the rescissions.",

The House has already shown its support for the president\u2019s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he has finally found a way to achieve his goal of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation project.",
      "The push comes after a monthslong campaign by Trump to try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker, who has resisted the Republican president's calls to slash interest rates out of concerns about the administration's tariffs sparking higher levels of inflation.",
      "Trump indicated Tuesday that Powell\u2019s handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings in Washington could be grounds to take the unprecedented and possibly legally dubious step of firing him. \u201cI think it sort of is,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cWhen you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it\u2019s really disgraceful,\u201d Trump said, adding that he never saw the Fed chair as someone who needed a \u201cpalace.\u201d",
      "The project has been underway for years, going back to Trump\u2019s first term. But it only recently caught the White House\u2019s attention. Trump maintains Fed rate cuts would lower the costs of government borrowing, while Powell has warned a premature rate cut could worsen inflation and ultimately raise those borrowing costs.",
      "The risk of the Fed losing its political independence could undermine America\u2019s financial markets, possibly leading to a meltdown in stocks and investors charging a premium to lend to the U.S. economy.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "The Fed chair has been an obstacle in Trump's efforts to gain total control over the executive branch.",
      "Powell and his board have the dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable, a task that can require them to make politically unpopular moves such as raising interest rates to hold inflation in check. The general theory is that keeping the Fed free from the influence of the White House \u2014 other than for nominations of Fed officials \u2014 allows it to fulfill its mission based on what the economy needs, instead of what a politician wants.",
      "An attempt to remove Powell from his job before his term ends in May 2026 would undercut the Fed\u2019s long-standing independence from day-to-day politics and could lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and a weaker economy.",
      "The Supreme Court recently signaled that Trump can\u2019t fire Powell simply because the president disagrees with him on interest rates. But legally he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or dereliction of duty.",
      "Trump's workaround appears to be that Powell misrepresented the renovation project in congressional testimony and that the cost is excessive, thus meriting his dismissal.",
      "The Fed says its main headquarters, known as the Marriner S. Eccles building, was in dire need of an upgrade because its electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, among others, are nearly obsolete and some date back to the building's construction in the 1930s.",
      "The renovation will also remove asbestos, lead and other hazardous elements and update the building with modern electrical and communications systems. The H-shaped building, named after a former Fed chair in the 1930s and '40s, is located near some of Washington\u2019s highest-profile monuments and has references to classical architecture and marble in the facades and stonework. The central bank is also renovating a building next door that it acquired in 2018.",
      "The Fed says there has been periodic maintenance to the structures but adds this is the first \u201ccomprehensive renovation.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials have criticized the Fed over the project's expense, which has reached $2.5 billion, about $600 million more than was originally budgeted.",
      "Like a beleaguered homeowner facing spiraling costs for a remodeling project, the Fed cites many reasons for the greater expense. Construction costs, including for materials and labor, rose sharply during the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022. More asbestos needed to be removed than expected. Washington's local restrictions on building heights forced it to build underground, which is pricier.",
      "In 2024, the Fed's board canceled its planned renovations of a third building because of rising costs.",
      "The Fed says the renovations will reduce costs \u201cover time\u201d because it will be able to consolidate its roughly 3,000 Washington-based employees into fewer buildings and will no longer need to rent as much extra space as it does now.",
      "Russ Vought, the administration's top budget adviser, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d about the Fed's \u201costentatious overhaul\u201d of its facilities.",
      "The Fed's renovation plans call for \u201crooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more,\" Vought said in last week's letter.",
      "Powell has disputed the claims, which were given wide circulation in a paper issued by the Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, in March 2025. The paper was written by Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and former Fed staffer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no VIP dining room,\" Powell said last month during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no new marble. ... There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. ... And there's no roof terrace gardens.\u201d",
      "Some of those elements were removed from initial building plans submitted in 2021, the Fed says.",
      "The Fed's changes to its building plans have opened it up to another line of attack: White House officials suggest the Fed violated the terms of the approval it received from a local planning commission by changing its plans.",
      "In its September 2021 approval of the project, the National Capital Planning Commission said it \u201cCommends\u201d the Fed for \u201cfully engaging partner federal agencies.\u201d But because the Fed changed its plans, the administration is indicating it needed to go back to the commission for a separate approval.",
      "Essentially, White House officials are saying Powell is being reckless with taxpayer money because of the cost of the renovation, but they are also accusing him of acting unethically by scaling back the project to save money.",
      "James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff whom Trump named to the commission, said in a post on X that Powell\u2019s June congressional testimony \"leads me to conclude the project is not in alignment with plans submitted to & approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.\u201d",
      "Speaking last Thursday at the planning commission meeting, Blair said he intends to tour the construction site, review materials from the Fed on how the approved 2021 renovation plans have changed and circulate a letter among his colleagues on the commission that would go to Fed officials.",
      "The central bank says, in a series of frequently asked questions on its website, that it is \"not subject to the direction\u201d of the commission and has only complied with its directives voluntarily.",
      "Instead, the Fed said it is accountable to the Senate and the House of Representatives and is overseen by an independent inspector general, not the White House. Powell has asked the inspector general to review the costs of the renovation project.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise near Australia",
      "BEIJING -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he complained to China's President Xi Jinping during a meeting on Tuesday about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise off the Australian coast that forced commercial aircraft to change course.",
      "The exercise, held in February, saw a Chinese flotilla partially circumnavigate Australia in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.",
      "The mission was widely regarded as a display of Chinese military strength and was among several issues raised in what Albanese described as a \u201cvery constructive meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Xi said that China engaged in exercises, just as Australia engages in exercises,\u201d Albanese told reporters, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "\u201cThere was no breach of international law by China, but that we were concerned about the notice and the way that it happened, including the live-fire exercises,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Albanese said the Chinese leader did not mention U.S. pressure on allies to declare positions on a potential war over Taiwan.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed on Taiwan Australia's position of support for the status quo,\u201d Albanese said. Australia has a one-China policy that recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and considers Taiwan a part of China.",
      "With the 10th anniversary of Australia's free trade deal with China falling this year, both governments have agreed to review the pact with an aim to improve economic relations.",
      "Following the meeting with Xi, Albanese met Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People\u2019s Congress.",
      "At the outset of the leaders' meeting, Xi told Albanese that seeking common ground while setting aside differences is in line with \"the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples.\u201d",
      "Albanese concurred with Xi's remark, saying \u201cThat approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.\u201d",
      "There had been speculation that Xi would use the meeting to raise Albanese\u2019s plan to end a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year-lease on the strategically important Port of Darwin, which the United States is concerned could be used to spy on its military forces.",
      "Landbridge Industry Australia, a subsidiary of Rizhao-based Shandong Landbridge Group, signed the lease with the debt-laden Northern Territory government in 2015. That was three years after U.S. Marines began annual rotations through Darwin as part of the U.S. pivot to Asia.",
      "Chinese social media influencer Lu Wenxing had posted that China could retaliate against ending the lease with \u201ccountermeasures, such as restricting Australian companies\u2019 market access in China or tightening imports of key resources such as iron ore.\u201d",
      "But Albanese said Xi didn\u2019t raise the lease, nor did he discuss the broader issue of Australia\u2019s foreign investment rules that prevent Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure.",
      "Reporters questioned Albanese about Chinese security officials' treatment of Australian journalists who traveled to China with him.",
      "Reporter Stephen Dziedzic said he was with a camera crew on Tuesday recording a piece to camera for Australian TV news in front of a Beijing landmark when they were interrupted by security guards. The guard told them police would be called and the Australians weren't permitted to leave.",
      "Another reporter, Anna Henderson, said guards told journalists to delete their footage. Australian diplomats intervened and TV crews were permitted to leave.",
      "\u201cChina has a different system, obviously, with the media,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The state visit is Albanese's second visit to China since he was first elected prime minister in 2022.",
      "Australia, like many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is caught between China and the United States. Its economy is heavily dependent on exports to China, including iron ore for the steel industry. But it also shares America's concerns about China\u2019s human rights record and its growing military activity in the Pacific, including in waters near Australia.",
      "Albanese is in Beijing at the midpoint of a weeklong trip to China that started in Shanghai \u2014 China\u2019s commercial capital \u2014 where government and business leaders from the two countries discussed deepening cooperation in tourism and reducing carbon emissions in iron ore mining and steel production.",

      "Collier County, Florida, uses one of the most advanced 911 systems in the U.S., allowing callers to send texts and videos",
      "NAPLES, Fla. -- When an emergency happens in Collier County, Florida, the 911 calls go to one of the most high-tech communications centers in the U.S., where callers can send text and video from the scene to dispatchers.",
      "Moving to what's known as an NG911 \u2014 or Next Generation 911 \u2014 system is a journey Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and Bob Finney, the county's director of communication, have been on for much of the past decade.",
      "It's a long way from Feb. 16, 1968, when Alabama's then-House Speaker Rankin Fite made the nation's very first 911 call in Haleyville, Alabama, on a bright red, rotary-style landline telephone. That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number.",
      "Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers.",
      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

      "The diplomats did not provide details of the deal being sought.

      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.",
      "Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.",
      "The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.",
      "The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.",
      "\u201cThe past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,\u2019\u2019 said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we\u2019ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.\u2019\u2019",
      "Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.",
      "Government policy was meant to help.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom \u2013 investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 \u2013 that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.",
      "But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden\u2019s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, \u201cmanufacturing production will continue to flatline.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cManufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.\u2019\u2019",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers \u2014 and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America \u2014 by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.",
      "In some ways, Trump\u2019s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But \u201cwhen you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,\u2019\u2019 Zuzick said. \u201cSo that\u2019s definitely a situation where it\u2019s beneficial.\u2019\u2019",
      "But American factories import and use foreign products, too \u2013 machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.",
      "Consider steel. Trump\u2019s tariffs don\u2019t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices \u2013 and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.",
      "In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France \u2014 and pay Trump\u2019s tariff.",
      "Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs.

      "The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: \u201cCustomers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 a fabricated metal products company said.",
      "\u201cTariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,\u2019\u2019 added a computer and electronics firm. \u201cThe situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Some may argue that things aren\u2019t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they\u2019ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.",
      "Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.",
      "Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off \u2013 and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 \u2014 the most since 1994 \u2014 and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.",
      "But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.",
      "In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,\u2019\u2019 said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers.",

      "The Indian government has proposed requiring the lowest temperature setting on all new air conditioners to be 20 Celsius, or 68 Fahrenheit",
      "BENGALURU, India -- India\u2019s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.",
      "The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).",
      "Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.",
      "The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.",
      "Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.",
      "Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn't specific about timing.",
      "The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India's sweltering cities.",
      "\u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,\u201d said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cSometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it\u2019s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don\u2019t do this.\"",
      "Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India\u2019s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.",
      "Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.",
      "If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India\u2019s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India\u2019s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",
      "Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use \u2014 one in the afternoon and another around midnight \u2014 driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.",
      "The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.",
      "Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.",
      "\u201cPeople used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,\u201d said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.",
      "New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople have gotten too comfortable,\u201d he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.",
      "Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.",
      "\u201cTightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,\u201d said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.",
      "Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country\u2019s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.",
      "Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn't be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.",
      "\u201cAlthough India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.",
      "\u201cAir conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,\u201d said Abhyankar.",

      "A federal court in Miami began considering Monday whether Elon Musk's car company should share blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend",
      "NEW YORK -- A rare trial against Elon Musk's car company began Monday in Miami where a jury will decide if it is partly to blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiff argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature called Autopilot should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing red lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at nearly 70 miles an hour in the April 2019 crash. Tesla lays the blame solely on the driver, who was reaching for a dropped cell phone.",
      "\u201cThe evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cInstead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cellphones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver.\u201d",
      "The driver, George McGee, was sued separately by the plaintiffs. That case was settled.",
      "A judgement against Tesla could be especially damaging as the company works to convince the public its self-driving technology is safe during a planned rollout of hundreds of thousands of Tesla robotaxis on U.S. roads by the end of next year. A jury trial is rare for the company, whose suits over crashes are often dismissed or settled, and this one is rarer yet because a judge recently ruled that the family of the stricken Naibel Benavides Leon can argue for punitive damages.",
      "The judge, Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, issued a partial summary judgement last month, throwing out charges of defective manufacturing and negligent misrepresentation against Tesla. But she also ruled plaintiffs could argue other claims that would make the company liable and ask for punitive damages, which could prove costly.",
      "\u201cA reasonable jury could find that Tesla acted in reckless disregard of human life for the sake of developing their product and maximizing profit,\u201d Bloom said in a filing.",
      "The 2021 lawsuit alleges the driver relied on Autopilot to reduce speed or come to a stop when it detected objects in its way, including a parked Chevrolet Tahoe that Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, had gotten out of near Key West, Florida, to look up at the sky. The Tesla rammed the Tahoe at highway speeds, causing it to rotate and slam into Benavides, tossing her into a wooded area and killing her.",
      "In legal documents, Tesla denied nearly all of the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it expects that consumers will follow warnings in the vehicle and instructions in the owners\u2019 manual, as well as comply with driving laws. Tesla warns owners in manuals that its cars cannot drive themselves and they need to be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers argue that Tesla should have a geofenced its Autopilot so it only worked on the big roads it was designed for and drivers couldn\u2019t use it on smaller roads such as the rural one where Benavides was killed. They also say data and video evidence shows the Autopilot did detect the Tahoe but then failed to warn the driver as they claim it should have done.",
      "Tesla has since improved its driver-assistance and partial self-driving features, but still faces lawsuits and investigations over what critics say is a gap between its exaggerated depictions of how well they work and what they can actually do.",
      "Federal auto safety regulators recalled 2.3 million Teslas in 2023 for problems with Autopilot failing to sufficiently alert drivers if they weren\u2019t paying attention to the road. They then put Tesla under investigation last year for saying it fixed the problem though it was unclear it actually did that.",
      "Musk has also continued to make public comments suggesting Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology, a more advanced version of Autopilot, allows cars to drive themselves, despite warnings from regulators not to do so because it could lead to overreliance on the systems, crashes and deaths. That technology has been involved in three fatal crashes and is under investigation of its ability to see in low-visibility conditions such as sunlight glare or fog.",
      "Tesla is promising a much more robust self-driving technology to power its robotaxis with no one behind the wheel. A test run in Austin, Texas, of the taxis appears to have gone mostly well, though there are scattered problems, such as a case when one cab went down the opposing lane.",

      "The U.S. government says it's placing a 17% duty on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations ended without an agreement to avert the tariff",
      "The U.S. government said Monday it is immediately placing a 17% duty on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations ended without an agreement to avert the tariff.",
      "Proponents said the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of the U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange.",
      "Robert Guenther, the trade group's executive vice president, said the duty was \u201can enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "But opponents said the import tax will make tomatoes more expensive for U.S. consumers. Mexican greenhouses specialize in vine-ripened tomatoes, while Florida tomatoes are typically grown in fields and picked green.",
      "\u201cAs an industry, we are saddened that American consumers will have to pay a tomato tax, or duty, for a reduced selection of the tomatoes they prefer, such as tomatoes on the vine, grape tomatoes, Romas, cocktail tomatoes and other specialty varieties,\u201d said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes.",
      "Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, said U.S. retail prices for tomatoes will likely rise around 8.5% with a 17% duty.",
      "Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy institute, said areas with a higher reliance on Mexican tomatoes could see price increases close to 10%, since it will be more difficult to replace that supply, while other parts of the U.S. could see price increases closer to 6%.",
      "The duty stems from a longstanding U.S. complaint about Mexico's tomato exports and is separate from the 30% base tariff on products made in Mexico and the European Union that President Donald Trump announced on Saturday.",
      "The Commerce Department said in late April that it was withdrawing from a deal it first reached with Mexico in 2019 to settle allegations the country was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping.",
      "As part of the deal, Mexico had to sell its tomatoes at a minimum price and abide by other rules. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties.",
      "In announcing its withdrawal from the Tomato Suspension Agreement, the Commerce Department said it had been \u201cflooded with comments\u201d from U.S. tomato growers who wanted better protection from Mexican goods.",
      "\u201cMexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \u201cThis rule change is in line with President Trump\u2019s trade policies and approach with Mexico.\u201d",
      "But others, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, had called on the Commerce Department to reach an agreement with Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had also urged the Commerce Department to leave the current tomato agreement in place.",
      "In a letter sent to Lutnick last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 30 other business groups said U.S. companies employ 50,000 workers and generate $8.3 billion in economic benefits moving tomatoes from Mexico into communities across the country.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement \u2013 at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty \u2013 could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners against other commodities and crops that could create further hardship for U.S. businesses and consumers,\u201d the letter said.",

      "Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast",
      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% last month from a year ago, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May, according to data provider FactSet. The Labor Department will issue its inflation report at 8:30 a.m. eastern. On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% from May to June, the largest increase since January, economists project.",
      "Worsening inflation could pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year's presidential campaign to immediately lower costs. The sharp inflation spike of 2022-2023 was the worst in four decades and soured most Americans on former president Joe Biden's handling of the economy.",
      "Faster price increases would also likely underscore the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut its short-term interest rate, as Trump is loudly demanding.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, inflation is forecast to have risen 3% in June from a year earlier, up from a 2.8% rise in May. On a monthly basis, it is also expected to have picked up 0.3% from May to June, according to FactSet. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Trump has imposed sweeping duties of 10% on all imports, plus 50% levies on steel and aluminum, 30% on goods from China, and 25% on imported cars. Just last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30% tariff starting Aug. 1.",
      "So far, the tariffs haven't noticeably pushed up inflation, which has been mild for the past four months. Core inflation has fallen from 3.3% in January to 2.8% in May, though that is still above the Fed's 2% target. If inflation in June is much weaker than economists forecast, Trump will likely renew his demands that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell immediately reduce borrowing costs.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized that they want to see how the economy evolves as the tariffs take effect before cutting their key short-term rate. The Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them.",
      "Trump on Monday said that Powell has been \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d The president added that the economy was doing well despite Powell\u2019s refusal to reduce rates, but it would be \u201cnice\u201d if there were rate cuts \u201cbecause people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.\u201d",
      "Last week, White House officials also attacked Powell for cost overruns on the years-long renovation of two Fed buildings, which are now slated to cost $2.5 billion, roughly one-third more than originally budgeted. While Trump legally can't fire Powell just because he disagrees with his interest rate decisions, the Supreme Court has signaled, he may be able to do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or mismanagement.",
      "While inflation was mild in May, there were already signs in last month's report that tariffs were starting to have some impact. The cost of furniture, appliances, toys, and tools rose, though those increases were offset by falling prices for airfares, hotels, and muted rises in rental costs.",
      "Some companies have said they have or plan to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, including Walmart, the world's largest retailer. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1% in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement \u201csurgical\u201d price hikes to offset tariff costs.",
      "But many companies have been able to postpone or avoid price increases, after building up their stockpiles of goods this spring to get ahead of the duties. Other companies may have refrained from lifting prices while they wait to see whether the U.S. is able to reach trade deals with other countries that lower the duties.",

      "The search for those missing after Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The search for those missing after Yemen's Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for, the private security firms involved said Monday.",
      "The announcement came as satellite photos show long, trailing oil slicks from where the bulk carrier Eternity C sank, as well as another where the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas by the Iranian-backed Houthis took place.",
      "Both ships were attacked over a week ago by the rebels as part of their campaign targeting vessels over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that's upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which $1 trillion of goods usually passes a year.",
      "The private security firms Ambrey and Diaplous Group ran the search for those missing from the Eternity C, which had a three-man security team aboard but requested no escort from either the U.S. Navy or a European Union force in the region. The ship came under attack July 7 and faced hours of Houthi assaults by small arms and bomb-carrying drones before ultimately sinking in the Red Sea.",
      "The initial attack on the Eternity C came a day after the attack on the Magic Seas. Both ships were Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned vessels.",
      "Ten people were recovered alive from the attack, including eight Filipino crew members and a Greek and Indian from the vessel\u2019s security team, the EU's Operation Aspides said. At least four are presumed to have been killed in the attack, leaving 11 others missing, the EU mission has said.",
      "The Houthis claimed to have taken some mariners after the attack, but have offered no evidence of that. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen said it believed the rebels had \u201ckidnapped\u201d some of the crew.",
      "\u201cThe decision to end the search has been taken by the vessel\u2019s Owner reluctantly but it believes that, in all the circumstances, the priority must now be to get the 10 souls safely recovered alive ashore and to provide them with the urgent medical support they need at this difficult time,\u201d a statement by the security firms said. \u201cThe thoughts of all those involved in the rescue operation are with the families of those who remain missing.\u201d",
      "The attacks on the vessels also raised concerns about damage to the environment in the Red Sea, home to corals and wildlife that draws divers, tourists and scientists. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed Monday by The Associated Press show large, spreading oil slicks in the southern Red Sea where the vessels sank.",
      "Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, estimated the length of the slick from the Eternity C at some 80 kilometers (50 miles) and from the Magic Seas at some 65 kilometers (40 miles). He warned it could threatened wildlife reserves in nearby Eritrea in Africa and elsewhere.",
      "The oil comes from the ship's tanks and had been used for their own propulsion. Other shipping disasters have seen much of the slicks evaporate on their own, though they cause damage to the environment, too.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sank four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels.",
      "The Houthis' new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic that saw the Americans bomb three Iranian atomic sites.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is singling out Brazil for import taxes of 50%, citing its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump singled out Brazil for import taxes of 50% on Wednesday for its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, showing that personal grudges rather than simple economics are a driving force in the U.S. leader's use of tariffs.",
      "Trump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, specifically tying his tariffs to the trial of Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis Trial should not be taking place,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. \u201cIt is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "There is a sense of kinship as Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. president addressed his tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bested Bolsonaro in 2022.",
      "Lula responded in a forceful statement that said Trump's tariffs would trigger the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows trade, investment and intellectual property agreements to be suspended against countries that harm Brazil's competitiveness.",
      "He noted that the U.S. has had a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over the past 15 years.",
      "\u201cBrazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being taken for granted by anyone,\u201d Lula said.",
      "Bolsonaro testified before the country\u2019s Supreme Court in June over the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. Judges will hear from 26 other defendants in the coming months, and legal analysts say a decision could come as early as September. The country\u2019s electoral authorities have already barred Bolsonaro from running for office until 2030.",
      "The former president did not comment about Trump\u2019s tariff decision on his social media channels, but wrote that he is being politically persecuted.",
      "In his statement, Lula defended the country's legal system, saying the \u201cproceedings against those who planned the coup d\u2019etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to \u201cSECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.\u201d Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.",
      "Among the companies the Supreme Court fined was X, which was not mentioned specifically in Trump's letter. X is owned by Elon Musk, Trump's multibillionaire backer in the 2024 election whose time leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency recently ended and led to a public feud over the U.S. president's deficit-increasing budget plan. Trump also owns a social media company, Truth Social.",
      "\u201cIn Brazil, freedom of speech is not mistaken by aggression or violent behavior,\" Lula said in his statement. \"To operate in our country, every company, local or foreign, must be subjected to Brazilian legislation.\u201d",
      "Brazilian lawmakers allied with Lula blamed Bolsonaro and two of his sons, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, for Trump\u2019s tariff action. Sen. Lindbergh Farias, the whip of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party in the Senate, said on social media that the Bolsonaros \u201cmust be very happy to harm Brazil, our economy and our jobs.\u201d",
      "The Brazil letter was a reminder that politics and personal relations with Trump matter just as much as any economic fundamentals. And while Trump has said the high tariff rates he\u2019s setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America.",
      "The tariffs starting Aug. 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10% rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement. In addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the U.S., among other products. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "Trump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the U.S. was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. But that rationale becomes problematic in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the U.S. exports more to Brazil than it imports.",
      "Trump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations. None of them \u2014 the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka \u2014 is a major industrial rival to the United States.",
      "Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies. His administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday and cause factory jobs to return to the United States.",
      "Trump, during a White House meeting with African leaders, talked up trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade, he said, \u201cseems to be a foundation\u201d for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia.",
      "\u201cYou guys are going to fight, we\u2019re not going to trade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we seem to be quite successful in doing that.\u201d",
      "Trump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d and trade imbalances, even though the Brazil letter indicated otherwise. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office \u2014 Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau \u2014 as \u201cthese are friends of mine now.\u201d",
      "Countries are not complaining about the rates outlined in his letters, he said, even though those tariffs have been generally close to the ones announced April 2 that rattled financial markets. The S&P 500 stock index rose Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe really haven\u2019t had too many complaints because I\u2019m keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Officials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump's ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%.",
      "According to Trump's Wednesday letters, imports from Libya, Iraq, Algeria and Sri Lanka would be taxed at 30%, those from Moldova and Brunei at 25% and those from the Philippines at 20%. The tariffs would start Aug. 1.",
      "The Philippine government's reaction has been relatively tame. Its ambassador in Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, said the country will seek new negotiations with the U.S. to lower the 20% tariff.",
      "The Census Bureau reported that last year the U.S. ran a trade imbalance on goods of $1.4 billion with Algeria, $5.9 billion with Iraq, $900 million with Libya, $4.9 billion with the Philippines, $2.6 billion with Sri Lanka, $111 million with Brunei and $85 million with Moldova. The imbalance represents the difference between what the U.S. exported to those countries and what it imported.",
      "Taken together, the trade imbalances with those seven countries are essentially a rounding error in a U.S. economy with a gross domestic product of $30 trillion.",
      "The letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10%. Trump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his Aug. 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters.",
      "The president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate.",

      "Soccer faces growing challenges from extreme heat, as seen during the FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this summer",
      "GENEVA -- Soccer had a fierce reckoning with heat at the recently concluded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States \u2014 a sweltering preview of what players and fans may face when the U.S. co-hosts the World Cup with Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "With temperatures rising worldwide, scientists warn that staging the World Cup and other soccer tournaments in the Northern Hemisphere summer is getting increasingly dangerous for both players and spectators. Some suggest that FIFA may have to consider adjusting the soccer calendar to reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe deeper we go in the decade, the greater the risk without considering more dramatic measures, such as playing in the winter months and/or cooler latitudes,\u201d said Prof. Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures in Leeds, England. \u201cI\u2019m getting increasingly worried that we are only one heatwave away from a sporting tragedy and I would like to see governing bodies lean into the climate and health science.\u201d",
      "Tournament soccer in June and July is a tradition going back to the first World Cup in 1930.",
      "Since then, the three-month period of June, July and August globally has warmed by 1.05 degrees Celsius (1.89 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Meanwhile, European summer temperatures have increased by 1.81 degrees C. The rate of warming has accelerated since the 1990's.",
      "Climate scientists say that\u2019s a factor that needs to be considered when playing high-intensity outdoor sports like soccer.",
      "\u201cIf you want to play football for 10 hours a day, they\u2019ll have to be the hours of the early morning and late evening,\u201d climatologist Friederike Otto from Imperial College, London, told The Associated Press in an email, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to have players and fans die from heatstroke or get severely ill with heat exhaustion.\u201d",
      "Extreme heat and thunderstorms made an impact on FIFA's newly expanded tournament for club teams. The Club World Cup was held in 11 American cities from June 14 to July 13.",
      "FIFA adapted by tweaking its extreme heat protocol to include extra breaks in play, more field-side water, and cooling the team benches with air fans and more shade.",
      "Still, Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez said the heat made him dizzy and urged FIFA to avoid afternoon kickoffs at the World Cup next year.",
      "The global soccer players union, FIFPRO, has warned that six of the 16 World Cup cities next year are at \u201cextremely high risk\u201d for heat stress.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino addressed the heat concerns on Saturday, saying the handful of World Cup stadiums that are covered would be used for day-time games next year.",
      "Extreme heat could become an even bigger challenge at the following World Cup in 2030, which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco. Games are scheduled to be played in afternoons and early evenings from mid-June to mid-July. All three countries have already seen temperatures rise above 40 degrees C (well above 100 Fahrenheit) this summer.",
      "FIFA downplayed the heat risk in its in-house evaluation of the 2030 World Cup bid, saying \u201cweather conditions are difficult to predict with the current development in global and local climate, but are unlikely to affect the health of players or other participants.\u201d",
      "The physical effects of playing 90 minutes of soccer in direct sunshine during the hottest part of the day can be severe and potentially result in hyperthermia \u2013 abnormally high body temperatures.",
      "\u201cWhen players experience hyperthermia, they also experience an increase in cardiovascular strain,\u201d said Julien P\u00e9riard of the University of Canberra.",
      "\u201cIf core temperature increases excessively, exertional heat illness can occur,\u201d leading to muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, and even life-threatening heat stroke, he said.",
      "Many sports events held in the summer adjust their start times to early morning or late night to minimize the risk heat-related illness, including marathons at the Olympics  or track world championships. Morning kickoffs, however, are rare in soccer, where World Cup match schedules are often set with European TV audiences in mind.",
      "It would be hard for FIFA to avoid day-time World Cup kickoffs given the packed match schedule as the number of participating teams increases from 32 to 48 in 2026.",
      "Heat mainly becomes an issue when the World Cup is held in the Northern Hemisphere, because June and July are winter months in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "FIFA has stuck to its traditional June-July schedule for the men\u2019s World Cup except in 2022 when it moved the tournament to November-December to avoid the summer heat in Qatar. Something similar is expected when neighboring Saudi Arabia hosts the tournament in 2034.",
      "However, moving the World Cup to another part of the year is complicated because it means Europe\u2019s powerful soccer leagues must interrupt their season, affecting both domestic leagues and the Champions League.",
      "FIFA didn\u2019t respond to questions from AP about whether alternate dates for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups were being considered.",
      "When and where to schedule the World Cup and other outdoor sports events is likely to become more pressing as the world continues to warm.",
      "Athletes and even everyday people doing basic physical activities are now exposed to 28% more of moderate or higher heat risk in 2023 than they were in the 1990s, said Ollie Jay, a professor at the University of Sydney who has helped shape policy for the Australian Open in tennis.",
      "\u201cThis is symbolic of something bigger,\u201d said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist. \u201cNot just the danger and inconvenience to fans and players, but the fundamentally disruptive nature of climate change when it comes our current way of life.\u201d",

      "The NBA may finally be one step closer on the long road to expansion",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The NBA may finally be one step closer on the long road to expansion.",
      "Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that the league has been tasked by team owners to study the issue more formally as part of in-depth analysis, which would be the first official move in a long process toward adding franchises.",
      "There's no timetable about how long the process will take, nor have any decisions been made on what the expansion fee will be, when the new teams will start play \u2014 or even if expansion is going to actually happen.",
      "The league isn't creating a new committee to study expansion; the duties, for now, will fall primarily to a pair of existing groups, with the advisory finance committee leading and the audit and strategy committee also involved.",
      "\u201cA lot of analysis still needs to be done and nothing has been predetermined,\u201d Silver said.",
      "The decision to take a harder look at expansion wasn\u2019t totally unexpected, since the notion of adding clubs has been a talking point for several years. Cities like Las Vegas and Seattle \u2014 long perceived to be the front-runners should the NBA decide to expand past its current 30-team footprint \u2014 will surely continue to push to be the eventual picks. And Silver himself has said previously that he expects expansion will happen at some point.",
      "\u201cI think there is a significant step now in that we are now engaging in this in-depth analysis, something we weren\u2019t prepared to do before,\" Silver said. \"But beyond that, it\u2019s really Day 1 of that in-depth analysis. And so, in terms of price, potential timing, it\u2019s too early to say. ... It is truly a complicated issue.\u201d",
      "The next board of governors meeting will likely take place sometime in September.",
      "Expansion has long been a difficult issue, since it\u2019ll mean, among other things, that the current owners will have decided to sell equity in a league that is on a financial roll right now.",
      "\u201cFor every team you add, you're diluting the economics of the current league,\u201d Silver said.",
      "A new series of media rights deals worth $76 billion kicks in for this coming season, franchise values across the league have soared and the two most title-laden franchises in the NBA, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, clubs that have combined for about half of the titles handed out in league history, are in the process of being sold with a combined valuation of at least $16.1 billion.",
      "The Celtics are being sold to private equity mogul Bill Chisholm with a valuation of at least $6.1 billion, which was a record until the Buss family agreed to sell the Lakers to businessman Mark Walter \u2014 also the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 with a valuation of $10 billion.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that those purchase prices have an impact on any economic analysis of teams, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily complicate it more, but it certainly is an indication of value,\" Silver said. \u201cAnd one other factor we have to look at: we\u2019re trying to think what is the value of expansion, what does it mean to dilute the existing equity, and how additive is this potentially to the league by adding an additional team.\u201d",
      "The league has added seven franchises since 1988, but none since 2004. There has been several instances of rebranding and relocating since \u2014 most notably, the Seattle SuperSonics moving to Oklahoma City in 2008 and becoming the Thunder \u2014 but the league has been at 30 teams for the past two decades.",

      "Fauja Singh, known as the Turbaned Torpedo and believed to be the world\u2019s oldest marathon runner, has died at 114 after being hit by a car in India",
      "LONDON -- Fauja Singh, an Indian-born runner nicknamed the Turbaned Torpedo who was believed to be the world\u2019s oldest marathon runner, has died after being hit by a car. He was 114.",
      "Local media in India reported that Singh sustained severe head injuries in a hit-and-run accident on Monday while he was crossing the road at his native village near Jalandhar in Punjab. He was taken to the hospital where he later died. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs In The City, confirmed his death.",
      "India\u2019s Prime minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh, saying he was \u201cextraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness.\u201d",
      "Singh became the oldest man to run a full marathon in 2011 at the age of 100 in Toronto. His accomplishment was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he did not have a birth certificate to prove his age. Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911.",
      "A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on him because of its grisly nature.",
      "Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father\u2019s eyes.",

      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t think his life was worth living without his son\u201d following the traumatic incident, his coach Harmander Singh said.",
      "He went to live with his youngest son in London. That\u2019s where sports enthusiast Singh attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community and took part in sprints. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do.",
      "At the age of 89 in 2000 he ran the London Marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Marathon.",
      "\u201cFrom a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,\u201d Singh said.",

      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

      "Less than two weeks after terms of a multibillion-dollar college sports settlement went into effect, friction erupted over the definition of a \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d that collectives making name, image and likeness payments to players are supposed to have.",
      "The new College Sports Commission sent a letter to athletic directors last week saying it was rejecting deals in which players were receiving money from collectives that were created solely to pay them and don't provide goods or services to the general public for profit.",
      "A lead attorney for the players responded by saying those instructions went against settlement terms and asking the CSC to rescind the guidance.",
      "\u201cThis process is undermined when the CSC goes off the reservation and issues directions to the schools that are not consistent with the Settlement Agreement terms,\u201d attorney Jeffrey Kessler wrote to NCAA outside counsel Rakesh Kilaru in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Yahoo Sports first reported details of the letter, in which Kessler threatens to take the issue to a judge assigned with resolving disputes involved in the settlement.",
      "Kessler told the AP that his firm was not commenting on the contents of the letter, and Kilaru did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.",
      "Yahoo quoted a CSC spokesman as saying the parties are working to resolve differences and that \"the guidance issued by the College Sports Commission ... is entirely consistent with the House settlement and the rules that have been agreed upon with class counsel.\u201d",
      "When NIL payments became allowed in 2021, boosters formed so-called collectives that were closely tied to universities to work out contracts with the players, who still weren't allowed to be paid directly by the schools.",
      "Terms of the House settlement allow schools to make the payments now but keep the idea of outside payments from collectives, which have to be approved by the CSC if they are worth $600 or more.",
      "The CSC, in its letter last week, explained that if a collective reaches a deal, for instance, for an athlete to appear on behalf of the collective, which charges an admission fee, that collective does not have a \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d because the purpose of the event is to raise money to pay athletes, not to provide goods or services available to the general public for profit.",
      "Another example of a disallowed deal was one an athlete makes to sell merchandise to raise money to pay that player because, the CSC guidance said, the purpose of \u201cselling merchandise is to raise money to pay that student-athlete and potentially other student-athletes at a particular school or schools, which is not a valid business purpose.\"",
      "Kessler's letter notes that the \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d rule was designed to ensure athletes were not simply being paid to play, and did not prohibit NIL collectives from paying athletes for the type of deals described above.",
      "To prevent those payments \u201cwould be to create a new prohibition on payments by a NIL collective that is not provided for or contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, causing injury to the class members who should be free to receive those payments,\" Kessler wrote.",

      "Curveballs are disappearing from Major League Baseball as pitchers prioritize velocity, emphasizing sliders and sweepers",
      "ATLANTA -- Curveballs have been thrown a curve by a modern game valuing velocity over variety, disappearing from the major leagues by more than 20,000 annually.",
      "The Athletics have thrown curves on just 2.5% of pitches this season. The overall big league figure dropped from 10.7% in 2019 to 8.1% last year, the lowest since MLB starting tracking in 2008, before rising slightly to 8.5% this season.",
      "There were 22,962 fewer curveballs in 2024 than five years earlier.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really see a lot of people throwing 12-6 curveballs anymore,\u201d Tampa Bay pitcher Shane Baz said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have a hard cutter/slider. It\u2019s a lot easier for guys to throw a sweeper than it is a 12-6 curveball.\u201d",
      "Baz\u2019s 28.1% is seventh in curveball use among those who have thrown at least 1,000 pitches this season.",
      "Baltimore\u2019s Charlie Morton, first at 39%, learned to throw a hook from his dad.",
      "\u201cHe was reading some article or maybe he was reading some pitching book,\u201d Baltimore\u2019s 41-year-old right-hander said. \u201cYou basically throw it like you\u2019re re-throwing a knife.\u201d",
      "Hall of Famer Candy Cummings, a 145-game winner, is credited with inventing the curveball in 1863 when he was 14, discovering the movement when he threw sea shells into the Atlantic Ocean. Some attribute the curve to amateur pitcher Fred Goldsmith in 1870.",
      "With an average velocity of 80.2 mph, curves are the slowest and loopiest of breaking pitches, often disrupting the timing of batters set for smoke. The phrase \u201cthrown a curveball\u201d has become part of the English language, much like \u201cscrewball,\" more a phrase than a pitch these days.",
      "Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan and Clayton Kershaw were among the consummate curveballers, bamboozling batters as balls they gave up on dropped like hang gliders into the strike zone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become an industry of throwing over pitching,\u201d New York Yankees senior adviser Omar Minaya said. \u201cWhen you pitch, you use different pitches. What we\u2019re seeing in the industry as a whole, especially with showcases, is people are looking more at velocity than pitchability \u2014 as a scout, I said that unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Former pitcher Dallas Braden, now a broadcaster, longs for those days of deception.",
      "\u201cYou almost sympathize with the hitter in the moment because you\u2019re like: Damn, I couldn\u2019t have hit that. He couldn\u2019t hit that. Nobody could have hit that,\u201d Braden said. \u201cThe eephus is now almost like as close as we get, when a position player is on the mound, to an aesthetically pleasing pitch like that, just the visual presentation of the pitch starting in the clouds and ending up at the ankles.\u201d",
      "Nike\u2019s \u201cChicks Dig the Long Ball\u201d commercial defined baseball in the Steroids Era. These days the slogan might as well be: \u201cVelo Rules!\u201d There were just 214 pitches of 100 mph or more in 2008. There were a record 3,880 two years ago and this year is on track for 3,252.",
      "In tandem, starting pitcher use has dropped. Starters have averaged just under 5 1/3 innings this season, down from 6 1/3 innings in the 1980s. Their pitch count averages 85.7, down from 97 in 2010",
      "Average four-seam fastball velocity is a record 94.4 mph this season, up from 91.9 mph when MLB started tracking in 2008. But fastballs \u2014 four-seam, two-seam and cutters, have dropped from 62.1% to 55%.",
      "Those missing hooks and heaters have been replaced by sliders, sweepers and slurves. They are 22.6% of pitches this year, up from 13.9% in 2008, and their average velocity has risen to 84.8 mph from 83.4 mph.",
      "Colorado throws curves the most often at 15.6%, not that it has brought any success to a team that entered the break at 22-74, on track for a 37-125 finish and the post-1900 record for losses.",
      "The Athletics haven\u2019t thrown 10% curveballs since 2017.",
      "\u201cIf you look around the game, swing and miss has taken more of a priority, so guys are trying to throw more sweepers with more horizontal movement, or they\u2019re trying to throw the slider really hard at the bottom of the zone,\u201d Athletics pitching coach Scott Emerson said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about contact with the curveball.\u201d",
      "Veteran pitchers note the curve\u2019s decline as youngsters integrate into staffs.",
      "\u201cAs you\u2019re an amateur going to the big leagues guys are looking at velo. Guys are just looking at stuff,\u201d Yankees ace Gerrit Cole said. \u201cVelo is important and it pays.\u201d",
      "Maybe because the pitchers who throw curves are committed, batters have a .225 average this season on curves, down from .263 on fastballs and up slightly from .222 on sliders, sweepers and slurves.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just how the game is trending: to throw it as hard as you can, spin it the best you can and hope the hitter doesn\u2019t hit it,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cThe hitters are up there trying to swing as hard they can. If they hit it with hard contact, make 27 swings that are really hard, you got a chance to hit a homer here and there. And it\u2019s taken away from the contact-type pitchers.\u201d",

Like we\u2019ve shown in this 10-gamer, we can slug, or we can win one-run games, we can steal bases. I think playing good defense is a good part of that. I think it all starts with the pitching, which has been lights out.\u201d",
      "The pitching has been led by All-Star Garrett Crochet, who posted his first complete game, shutting out the Rays on Saturday.",

      "Jannik Sinner can look forward to his next matchup against Carlos Alcaraz now because he has finally ended a losing streak against his rival",
      "LONDON -- Jannik Sinner needed this victory.",
      "He wanted to win Wimbledon, of course, and it would have meant a lot to him no matter who the opponent was in the final.",
      "That this championship, his fourth at a Grand Slam tournament, came via a win over Carlos Alcaraz made it all the more significant to Sinner \u2014 and to the future of their burgeoning rivalry, the best men's tennis has to offer these days and, perhaps, for many years to come.",
      "\u201cIt is important, for sure,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sinner said Sunday night after prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 against No. 2 Alcaraz, \u201cbecause when you lose several times against someone, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d",
      "Sinner had lost five matches in a row against Alcaraz, none more disheartening than the one they played last month in the French Open final. Sinner grabbed a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of championship points, before losing in five sets after 5 hours, 29 minutes.",
      "\u201cI keep looking up to Carlos, because even today, I felt like he was doing couple of things better than I did,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something ... we will work on and prepare ourselves, because he\u2019s going to come for us again.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as soon as at the U.S. Open, which starts in New York on Aug. 24 and where Sinner is the defending champion. They will be seeded No. 1 and No. 2 again, so could only meet there in another final.",
      "Alcaraz won the trophy at Flushing Meadows in 2022, beginning a stretch in which he and Sinner have combined to win nine of the past 12 majors. That includes the last seven, leaving zero doubt that these two young guys \u2014 Sinner is 23, Alcaraz is 22 \u2014 have pushed themselves way past everyone else in the game at the moment.",
      "\u201cI'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him. It\u2019s great for us, and it is great for tennis. Every time we play against each other, our level is really high,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t (see) a level like this, if I\u2019m honest with you. I don\u2019t see any (other players) playing against each other (and) having the level that we are playing when we face each other.\u201d",
      "Both serve well, although Sinner was better at that Sunday. Both return well, although, again, Sinner was superior over these particular three hours. Both cover the court exceedingly well \u2014 Alcaraz is faster; Sinner has a bigger reach and is a better slider. Both hit the ball so, so hard \u2014 Alcaraz is more prone to the spectacular; Sinner is as pure and consistent a ball-striker as there is.",
      "And so on.",
      "One other contrast, usually, is that Alcaraz shows emotion, whether via yells of \u201cVamos!\u201d or the sort of point-to-his-ear-then-pump-his-fist celebration he did after winning Sunday's opening set by stretching and reaching low for a cross-court backhand to close a 12-stroke point.",
      "Sinner is far more contained. Even his arm-raised victory poses are mild-mannered.",
      "Sunday, though, there were more visible displays. He even shouted \u201cLet's go!\u201d after one point. Later, he shook his racket overhead while the crowd roared after a well-struck backhand. When he took a set with a forehand winner, Sinner held a pose, then lifted a fist.",
      "When the match was over, he crouched, lowered his head and pounded his right palm on the grass five times.",

      "Chris Gotterup gets to spend an extra week on links golf after winning the biggest title of his career",
      "NORTH BERWICK, Scotland -- Chris Gotterup came up with the clutch shots on the biggest stage he has faced Sunday, taking down crowd favorite Rory McIlroy with a 4-under 66 and a two-shot victory in the Scottish Open that gives him another week of links golf.",
      "Gotterup was one shot ahead of McIlroy when he hit his tee shot on the 196-yard 12th hole to 2 feet for birdie \u2014 McIlroy missed from 4 feet \u2014 to take command.",
      "Gotterup's lead was down to one over McIlroy and England's Marco Penge, but McIlroy missed a 12-foot birdie at the par-5 16th and Gotterup hit a right-to-left putt from 10 feet in the heart of the cup for a two-shot lead with two to play.",
      "Gotterup was so emotional when it was over he could barely speak, rubbing his eyes before saying, \u201cEveryone at home ... this is awesome. I'm not going to be able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "He didn't blink the rest of the way on the course after his final birdie, winning by two over McIlroy (68) and Penge (66) for his second PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cChris played a great round of golf. He was so solid,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cMade the bogey on 15 but bounced back with a really nice birdie on 16. After he got a couple ahead, I just couldn\u2019t claw back.\u201d",
      "Gotterup, built more like fellow New Jersey athlete Mike Trout than a golfer, also won the opposite-field Myrtle Beach Classic last year.",
      "The Genesis Scottish Open had one of the strongest fields of the year, and the perks are far greater. Gotterup, who played three years at Rutgers and won player-of-the-year awards as a senior at Oklahoma, gets into the Masters for the first time next April.",
      "The first stop is the British Open at Royal Portrush. Gotterup earned one of the three final spots through the International Qualifying Series, joined by Nicolai Hojgaard and Matti Schmid.",
      "Hojgaard closed with a 64 to move up 11 spots into a tie for fourth to join his twin brother at Royal Portrush. Schmid shot 71 and tied for 17th, helped by Jake Knapp's late collapse.",
      "Knapp was tied for the lead through five holes, but he took double bogey on the par-3 ninth and the rest of the back nine didn't go much better. He closed with a 74, losing on a chance to win and to play next week at Royal Portrush.",
      "McIlroy had said he was playing his best golf since going into the Masters, which he won in emotional fashion to complete the career Grand Slam. This was the first time he had seriously contended since that Masters victory, good timing with the Open in his native Northern Ireland starting on Thursday.",
      "But he couldn't keep up with Gotterup, who looked shaky at the start when he drove into a bunker and had to make a 4-foot bogey putt. He was rock solid the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really happy with where my game is \u2014 the way I played over the weekend, the shots that I hit, how I controlled my ball flight,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt has been a great week. Missing the trophy, that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "McIlroy battled to the end, especially on No. 11 when he had to pitch out left-handed and still managed to save par. When it was over, he said he was on his way to Royal Portrush, which McIlroy had not seen since the Friday of the 2019 British Open when he missed the cut.",
      "Former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick had a 67 and tied for fourth with Hojgaard, picking up valuable FedEx Cup points in what has been a down year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player coming off a two-week break, had a 67 and tied for eighth. It was his 10th consecutive tournament finishing eighth or better, a streak that began in the Houston Open.",

      "Some dolphins in Australia use sponges on their noses to hunt fish, a skill passed down through generations",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
      "Hunting with a sponge on their face interferes with bottlenose dolphins\u2019 finely tuned sense of echolocation, of emitting sounds and listening for echoes to navigate.",
      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",
      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "That difficulty may explain why it's rare \u2014 with only about 5% of the dolphin population studied by the researchers in Shark Bay doing it. That\u2019s about 30 dolphins total, said Jacobs.",
      "\u201cIt takes them many years to learn this special hunting skill \u2014 not everybody sticks with it,\u201d said marine ecologist Boris Worm at Dalhousie University in Canada, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Dolphin calves usually spend around three or four years with their mothers, observing and learning crucial life skills.",

      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it.

They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",

      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",

      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",

      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect",
      "NEW YORK -- A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.",
      "The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.",
      "Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule.",
      "\u201cNo subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,\" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.",
      "Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges \u2014 including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.",
      "\u201cCompanies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. \u201cPeople should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.",
      "Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free \u2014 or for a fee \u2014 and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.",
      "For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.",
      "The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon\u2019s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.",
      "Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate \u2014 half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.",
      "Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.",
      "The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer\u2019s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.",
      "The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule\u2019s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC\u2019s proposal as part of its \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.",

      "Wyoming's first new coal mine in 50 years is said to be opening soon but it won't rely on the fossil fuel to make money",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- The developer of what would be the first new coal mine in Wyoming in decades plans to process the fossil fuel to extract hard-to-get metals that are crucial for tech products and military hardware.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, former West Virginia U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, and Wyoming's congressional delegation are on the VIP list for a groundbreaking ceremony Friday at the Ramaco Resources, Inc., Brook Mine outside Ranchester in far northern Wyoming.",
      "Rare earth elements are a family of 17 metallic elements with unusual properties that make them useful for specific applications. Neodymium and dysprosium are used in the permanent magnets of wind turbines, lanthanum in electric and hybrid car batteries.",
      "Yttrium and terbium have critical military uses, including in targeting devices.",
      "China supplies almost 90% of the world's rare earths. Concern about continued access to the substances has been a focus of recent negotiations between China and the U.S., and led the Trump administration to try to encourage more production domestically.",
      "Rare earths aren't especially rare but so scattered they are difficult to bring together in useful quantities. Currently the only U.S. rare earths mine is at Mountain Pass in California.",
      "Analysis by U.S. national laboratories show the Brook Mine coal contains valuable quantities of the rare earths neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, as well as the critical minerals gallium, scandium and germanium, according to a Ramaco letter to shareholders on July 1.",
      "\u201cWe would intend to mine it here in Wyoming, process it here in Wyoming and sell it to domestic customers including the government,\u201d Ramaco CEO Randall Atkins said Thursday.",
      "Manchin, who left office in January after not seeking re-election, joined the Ramaco board in April.",
      "No new Wyoming coal mine has opened in 50 years. Wyoming's coal industry instead has shrunk substantially since its peak over a decade ago, troubled as utilities switch to renewable energy and power plants fueled by cheaper natural gas.",
      "The Brook Mine, stalled in part by landowners worried about groundwater depletion, has been in the works for over a decade. Atkins originally envisioned it as a source of subbituminous power plant fuel, much like Wyoming's massive open-pit mines that supply about 40% of the nation's coal.",
      "A public company with metallurgical coal mines in Appalachia, Ramaco in recent years received Department of Energy grants to develop coal into carbon-based products such as carbon fiber. This year, it got a $6.1 million grant from Wyoming to build a rare earth and critical minerals processing plant.",
      "A consultant report released this week found that fully developing the mine and processing plant would cost around $500 million, a sum that could be recovered in five years if the rare earths can be extracted and sold. Ramaco also would sell the processed coal as fuel, Atkins said.",

      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone discovery closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, I guess. Scientifically it\u2019s not that exciting,\u201d said Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque.",

      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is taking down antisemitic comments and other \u201cinappropriate posts\u201d made by its Grok chatbot, including some praising Adolf Hitler",
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company said Wednesday that it's taking down \u201cinappropriate posts\" made by its Grok chatbot, which appeared to include antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Grok was developed by Musk\u2019s xAI and pitched as alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Musk said Friday that Grok has been improved significantly, and users \u201cshould notice a difference.\u201d",
      "Since then, Grok has shared several antisemitic posts, including the trope that Jews run Hollywood, and denied that such a stance could be described as Nazism.",
      "\u201cLabeling truths as hate speech stifles discussion,\u201d Grok said.",
      "It also appeared to praise Hitler, according to screenshots of posts that have now apparently been deleted.",
      "After making one of the posts, Grok walked back the comments, saying it was \u201can unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration, swiftly deleted\" and that it condemned \"Nazism and Hitler unequivocally \u2014 his actions were genocidal horrors.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\u201d the Grok account posted early Wednesday, without being more specific.",
      "\"Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.",
      "Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it\u2019s likely that the Grok update that caused the chatbot to spew antisemitic messages this week was the \u201csoft launch\u201d of Grok 4, which Musk plans to introduce late Wednesday. But if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t appear ready, she said.",
      "\u201cFixing this is probably going to require retraining the model,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they can do at this point, if they\u2019re really going to launch tonight, are some more Band-Aids, like adding filters on responses and tweaking the prompt.\u201d",
      "Editing some of the chatbot\u2019s instructions \u201cmight make its behavior a little bit better\u201d but won\u2019t fix all of its problems.",
      "Musk and the xAI staff did release the latest version of the Grok platform late Wednesday, with the Tesla CEO making fantastical claims about the intelligence of version 4.0.",
      "He compared its intelligence to post-graduate level in \u201cevery subject\u201d and said while at times it might lack common sense and has not yet invented new things or discovered new technologies, it might \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which works to combat antisemitism, called out Grok's behavior.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic, plain and simple,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cThis supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.\u201d",
      "Musk later waded into the debate, alleging that some users may have been trying to manipulate Grok into making the statements.",
      "\u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed,\u201d he wrote on X, in response to comments that a user was trying to get Grok to make controversial and politically incorrect statements.",
      "Also Wednesday, a court in Turkey ordered a ban on Grok and Poland's digital minister said he would report the chatbot to the European Commission after it made vulgar comments about politicians and public figures in both countries.",
      "Krzysztof Gawkowski, who's also Poland's deputy prime minister, told private broadcaster RMF FM that his ministry would report Grok \u201cfor investigation and, if necessary, imposing a fine on X.\u201d Under an EU digital law, social media platforms are required to protect users or face hefty fines.",
      "\u201cI have the impression that we\u2019re entering a higher level of hate speech, which is controlled by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye ... is a mistake that could cost people in the future,\u201d Gawkowski told the station.",
      "Turkey's pro-government A Haber news channel reported that Grok posted vulgarities about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and well-known personalities. Offensive responses were also directed toward modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, other media outlets said.",
      "That prompted the Ankara public prosecutor to file for the imposition of restrictions under Turkey\u2019s internet law, citing a threat to public order. A criminal court approved the request early on Wednesday, ordering the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to enforce the ban.",
      "It's not the first time Grok's behavior has raised questions.",
      "Earlier this year the chatbot kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d despite being asked a variety of questions, most of which had nothing to do with the country. An \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d was behind the problem, xAI said.",

    "summary": "This week marked a possible pivot by President Donald Trump regarding Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Moscow has been steadily escalating its long-range strikes against Ukraine.",
      "LONDON -- This week marked a possible pivot by President Donald Trump regarding Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with his Monday announcement of a \"really big\" deal to provide Kyiv with new weapons and threats to impose further sanctions on Russia if it fails to agree a ceasefire within 50 days.",
      "Though Trump's decision was welcomed by leaders in Kyiv, Ukrainians and their supporters abroad also raised concerns that the 50-day window may offer Russian President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to intensify his long-range strikes against Ukrainian cities and ongoing summer frontline offensive.",
      "Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News he was \"cautiously optimistic,\" hoping Trump's announcement may signal a new \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Putin.",
      "\"However, the 50-day deadline is of some concern, because Putin might take it as a green light to intensify offensive operations,\" he said.",
      "The Russian attacks over the two nights since Trump's announcement suggest Moscow remains unmoved.",
      "Monday night and Tuesday night saw a cumulative 667 attack and decoy drones of various types, plus one missile, launched into Ukraine by Russia, according to figures published by the Ukrainian air force and analyzed by ABC News.",
      "The previous 50 days before Trump's announcement saw a total of 9,618 drones and 349 missiles launched into Ukraine -- an average of around 192 drones and seven missiles each day.",
      "The pattern of Russian long-range strikes suggest the next 50 days might be even more difficult for Ukrainians. Since May, the scale of Russian attacks has been steadily increasing despite Trump's efforts to force a ceasefire and eventual peace deal.",
      "In May, Russia launched a total of 3,835 drones and 117 missiles, for an average of around 124 drones and nearly four missiles each day.",
      "June saw 5,438 drones and 239 missiles fired into Ukraine, with a daily average of 181 drones and nearly eight missiles.",
      "Already in the first half of July, Ukraine has reported facing 4,003 drones and 89 missiles, for a daily average of 250 drones and more than five missiles.",
      "\"Russia is not changing its strategy,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after Tuesday night's attacks, in which the president said at least 16 people were injured.",
      "\"To effectively counter this terror, we need a systematic strengthening of defense: more air defense, more interceptors, more determination so that Russia feels our response,\" he added.",
      "Ukraine says many of those Russian drones have been aimed at non-military targets, including residential areas and city centers across Ukraine. Russia has maintained that it targets military and infrastructure sites.",
      "Trump defended his decision to give Moscow 50 days to act, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday, \"I don't think it's a long time. I think really the question should be asked, why did [former President Joe] Biden get us into that ridiculous war? Why did Biden bring us there?\"",
      "Asked why he believes Putin's opinion will change in 50 days, Trump said, \"a lot of opinions change very rapidly.\" He added, \"It might not be 50 days, he might be much sooner than 50 days.\"",
      "But Russian officials gave a cold response to Trump's announcement on Tuesday.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Trump's \"statements are very serious,\" telling reporters at a daily briefing, \"Some of them are addressed personally to President Putin. We definitely need time to analyze what was said in Washington.\"",
      "Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, meanwhile, told the state-run Tass news agency that making any demands of Russia is \"unacceptable,\" and that the Kremlin's position is \"unshakable.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested that Trump is \"under enormous, frankly indecent pressure from the EU and NATO's current leadership.\"",
      "Responding directly to Trump's timeline, Lavrov said Moscow wants \"to understand what this 50-day reference means. There were earlier mentions of 24 hours, then 100 days. We've seen this pattern before and genuinely want to comprehend the U.S. president's reasoning.\"",
      "As to the threat of new tariffs or sanctions, the foreign minister said, \"We're already dealing with an unprecedented number of sanctions and managing well. I have no doubt we'll handle these new measures too.\"",
      "Perhaps most forthright was Dmitry Medvedev -- the former Russian president and prime minister now serving as the deputy chairman of the country's Security Council -- who wrote on social media that the Kremlin was unmoved by Trump's \"theatrical ultimatum.\"",
      "\"The world shuddered, expecting the consequences,\" wrote Medvedev, who, during Moscow's full-scale war on Ukraine, has become known as a particularly hawkish voice within Putin's security establishment. \"Belligerent Europe was disappointed. Russia didn't care.\"",

      "Native American radio stations could face shutdowns if Congress cuts over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Dozens of Native American radio stations across the country vital to tribal communities will be at risk of going off the air if Congress cuts more than $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to industry leaders.",
      "The U.S. Senate is set to vote this week on whether to approve the Department of Government Efficiency's plan to rescind previously approved public broadcasting funding for 2026 and 2027. Fear is growing that most of the 59 tribal radio stations that receive the funding will go dark, depriving isolated populations of news, local events and critical weather alerts. The House already approved the cuts last month.",
      "\u201cFor Indian Country in general, 80% of the communities are rural, and their only access to national news, native story sharing, community news, whatever it is, is through PBS stations or public radio,\u201d said Francene Blythe-Lewis, CEO of the Lincoln, Nebraska-based Native American video programming producer Vision Maker Media. \u201cIf the claw back happens, I would say a good 90% of those stations will cease to exist.\u201d",
      "Local radio plays an outsized role in the lives of many who live in Indigenous communities, where cable television and broadband internet access are spotty, at best, and nonexistent for many. That leaves over-the-air TV stations \u2014 usually a PBS station \u2014 and more often local radio to provide local news, community event details and music by Indigenous artists. Sometimes the news is delivered in Indigenous languages.",
      "\u201cIt means we\u2019re not going to hear our language on the radio,\u201d Blythe-Lewis said.",
      "Flagstaff, Arizona-based Native Public Media, which supports the network of 59 radio stations and three television stations serving tribal nations across the country, said about three dozen of those radio stations that rely heavily on Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding will be the first to go dark if funding is cut for the coming fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.",
      "Loris Taylor, CEO of Native Public Media, said in an op-ed that the tribal stations reach more than 1.5 million people and \u201cmay be the only source of locally relevant news, emergency alerts, public safety announcements, language preservation, health information and election coverage.\u201d",
      "GOP senators are under pressure from President Donald Trump, who promised last week on his Truth Social platform that any Republican who votes against the cuts \u201cwill not have my support or Endorsement.\u201d",
      "Many Republicans say the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, recently defended the cuts as necessary to hack away at the nearly $37 trillion national debt, adding, \u201cIt is critical in restoring trust in government.\u201d",
      "But some Republicans have pushed back, such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who questioned the proposed cuts last month during a Senate committee hearing. She said that while some of the federal money is assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System, most of it goes to locally owned public radio and television stations.",
      "Jaclyn Sallee is president and CEO of Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and KNBA, its radio station in Anchorage, Alaska. Koahnic produces National Native News, a five-minute daily newscast that features headline news from across Indian Country, and Native America Calling, a daily hourlong call-in program, for about 190 stations across the nation. It also produces Indigefi, a music program in Indigenous languages.",
      "KNBA is on Native Public Media's list of those stations that would be most affected by the federal funding cuts \u2014 a concern Sallee confirmed, as 40% of the station's funding comes from CPB.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re really worried about are the rural stations in Alaska where they may be the only station in the community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people that live there depend on the station for vital weather alerts, emergency alerts; it\u2019s the local hub of the community where people share information. So that is very troublesome because people\u2019s lives are at risk without this service.\u201d",
      "It's currently fishing season in Alaska, she said, \u201cwhich means getting out in the ocean or in rivers and going long distances to subsist, and so they really rely on weather reports.\u201d",
      "Having the news reported in a tribe\u2019s language isn\u2019t just about preserving that language, she said. Sallee spent summers in Nome with her mother\u2019s family. Her grandmother, she said, spoke only Inupiaq.",
      "New Mexico PBS\u2019s signal reaches all but one of the more than 20 tribes and pueblos in the state. It also has signed an agreement with the Navajo Nation, which has the largest reservation of any tribe in the U.S., that allows the tribe to carry the PBS signal and programming on the Navajo Nation Television network, New Mexico PBS general manger Franz Joachim said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no question in my mind that, you know, immediately some stations will pretty much go dark,\u201d Joachim said.",
      "When those first stations fail, it won't take long for others to follow, Joachim said. And as they do, it will mean fewer and fewer stations left to pay membership dues that also help fund all of the stations.",
      "\u201cSo now the whole system starts to fracture,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for me, the federal funding is really about the system as a whole that keeps us in place.\u201d",
      "That funding also helps produce national content that groups like Vision Maker Media produce. Those include Native American documentaries shown on PBS like \u201cMankiller,\u201d the story of Wilma Mankiller who became the first woman elected principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.",
      "Blythe-Lewis compared the potential loss of tribal stations to the country's past attempts to erase Native American cultures, such as through federal boarding schools where Indigenous children were sent for generations to assimilate them into white society and where systemic abuse of Indigenous children was carried out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re erased from public media and therefore invisible and therefore become unknown and unheard of,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two milestones revealed this week illustrate the diminishing power of broadcast television in the media world \u2014 one fueled by the habits of young people and the other by their elders.",
      "During June, viewers spent more time watching streaming services than they did for broadcast and cable television combined. That happened for the first time ever in May, by a fraction of a percentage point, but the Nielsen company said on Tuesday that gap widened considerably in June.",
      "Also, for the third straight week, Nielsen said that Fox News Channel had more viewers in prime-time on weeknights than any of the main the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox entertainment.",
      "For years, the mantra of media executives was that streaming represented the future for in-home entertainment. Now, that future has clearly arrived.",
      "In June, 46% of Americans' TV time was spent on streaming services, led by YouTube and Netflix. Cable television networks represented 23.4% and broadcast was 18.5%, for a total of just under 42%, Nielsen said. It was the first time broadcast TV had ever slipped below 20% of total TV viewing.",
      "\u201cIt kind of felt like the right time,\u201d said Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen's senior vice president for product strategy and thought leadership. \u201cA lot of people thought it would happen more quickly.\u201d",
      "The driving force in June was school ending for young people, meaning they had more time to watch TV, where Netflix series like \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cSquid Game\u201d were big hits. Roughly two-thirds of people aged 6 to 17 watched streaming ahead of conventional TV, Nielsen said.",
      "In June 2024, the numbers were roughly reversed \u2014 47.7% of people were watching conventional TV in an average minute, with 40.3% logged on to a streaming service.",
      "While the direction is clear, it's not a death knell for conventional TV. June and July are fallow months, and their viewing will increase when football season begins and original episodes of comedies and dramas return, Fuhrer said.",
      "It's also not a strict either-or situation; media companies are doing a better job spreading their content out on different platforms to give viewers a choice, he said. The growth of YouTube, which many consumers can access for free and is a portal for \"traditional\" TV, has also fueled streaming services.",
      "Fox News has occasionally eclipsed the broadcast networks in viewership before, but last week represented the seventh week it has done so in 2025, already more than 2024 and 2023 combined. It averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time on weeknights last week, Nielsen said.",
      "Fox News is also taking advantage of what is traditionally the least-watched time of the year for broadcast networks, when summer nights and barbecues keep people outside. The difference this year is it has won a few weeks outside of the summer, during President Donald Trump's inauguration week in January, for example.",
      "Its audience \u2014 among the oldest of all television networks \u2014 tends to stay pretty steady throughout the year.",

      "She cited the two latest attacks by Houthis against civilian cargo vessels, the MV Magic Seas and the MV Eternity C, which caused both vessels to sink and led to the loss of innocent seafarers and saw crew members taken hostage.",
      "\u201cThe United States strongly condemns these unprovoked terrorist attacks, which demonstrate the threat that the Houthis pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security,\u201d Shea said, reiterating the council\u2019s demand for an immediate halt to Houthi attacks and the release of all crew members kidnapped from the Eternity C.",
      "The assaults represent the latest chapter of the rebels\u2019 campaign against shipping over the war in Gaza that began with Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 surprise attack in southern Israel. They also come as Yemen\u2019s nearly decadelong war drags on in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, without any sign of stopping.",
      "Greece\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris said the Houthi attacks have continued to fuel mistrust in the international maritime community, stressing that security and freedom of navigation are essential for the stability of global supply chains and economic development.",
      "\u201cIf the Red Sea region \u2014 a critical international maritime route \u2014 becomes even more degraded, it will expose the international community to more acute security risks and economic uncertainty,\u201d he warned.",
      "Russia\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said Moscow abstained because language in the previous resolution demanding a halt to Houthi attacks was arbitrarily interpreted to justify \u201cthe use of force affecting the territory of the sovereign state of Yemen.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe stand convinced that any steps aimed at stabilizing the situation in Yemen and around Yemen should be taken in political and diplomatic ways,\u201d he said.",
      "China\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Geng Shuang said his country abstained because \u201ccertain countries took military action against Yemen, which seriously impacted the Yemeni peace process and exacerbated tensions in the Red Sea.\u201d",
      "The Houthis have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Shuang called tensions in the Red Sea \u201ca major manifestation of the spillover from the Gaza conflict.\u201d Russia\u2019s Polyansky also stressed the link between normalizing the situation in the Red Sea and the need for a ceasefire in Gaza and release of all hostages.",
      "Algeria\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Toufik Koudri, whose country is the Arab representative on the Security Council, expressed regret the Yemen resolution demanding an immediate halt to Houthi attacks made no mention of the Gaza war, which he called \u201cone of the catalytic factors.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Security Council cannot disregard the clear nexus between the attacks in the Red Sea and the aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the deep feelings that resulted from the brutal massacres committed against innocent civilians,\u201d he said.",

      "A former U.S. Marine Corps reservist has been arrested and charged with attempted murder in connection with an attack at a Texas immigration detention center in which a police officer was shot in the neck, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Benjamin Hanil Song, 32, is the latest person charged in the Fourth of July assault in which attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas.",
      "Song, from Dallas, was arrested after a weeklong search and has been charged with three counts of attempted murder of federal agents and three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, the office said in a statement. He is accused of purchasing four of the guns linked to the attack, it said.",

      "Ten people, most of them from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, have previously been charged with attempted murder of a federal officer and discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. Another person has been charged with obstruction of justice for concealing evidence, while two others were charged with accessory after the fact for allegedly helping Song get away.",
      "If convicted, most of the defendants could face up to life imprisonment, while those charged with obstruction of justice and accessory after the fact would face lesser penalties if convicted, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "The shooting took place as President Donald Trump \u2019s administration ramps up deportations.",
      "The attackers initially set off fireworks and spray-painted vehicles and a guard structure, including the words \u201cIce Pig,\u201d according to a criminal complaint. This was \u201cdesigned to lure correctional officers outside the facility,\u201d according to U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Correctional officers called 911 and an Alvarado police officer responded and someone in the woods opened fire.",
      "Another person across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at correctional officers who were unarmed after they walked out of the facility, according to the office\u2019s statement.",
      "After the group fled, sheriff\u2019s deputies stopped seven people about 300 yards (275 meters) from where the officer was shot, according to a criminal complaint.",
      "\u201cThey were dressed in black, military-style clothing, some had on body armor, some were covered in mud, some were armed, and some had radios,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "A sheriff\u2019s office detective also stopped a van leaving the area and found two AR-style rifles and a pistol, along with ballistic-style vests and a helmet, the complaint said.",
      "The driver, the only person in the van, said he had been at the detention center. He said he had met some people online and drove some of them to the detention center from Dallas to \u201cmake some noise,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "Song\u2019s cellphone\u2019s location data shows it was near the detention center from about 11:30 p.m. on July 4 and throughout the day on July 5, according to a criminal complaint.",
      "\u201cThough Song escaped by hiding overnight after the attack, we were confident he would not remain hidden for long,\u201d Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Nancy E. Larson said in a statement. \u201cThe fourteen individuals who planned and participated in these heinous acts will be prosecuted, and we expect justice will be swift.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The United Kingdom, France and Germany have agreed to restore tough U.N. sanctions on Iran by the end of August if there has been no concrete progress on a nuclear deal, two European diplomats said Tuesday.",
      "The three countries' ambassadors to the United Nations met Tuesday at Germany\u2019s U.N. Mission to discuss a possible Iranian deal and reimposing the sanctions.

    "story": [
      "A carriage driver is on trial over a horse\u2019s collapse on a Manhattan street",
      "NEW YORK -- A carriage driver went on trial Tuesday over a horse's collapse on a Manhattan street, in a criminal case that encapsulates years of modern-day strife over an old-timey tourist attraction.",
      "Prosecutors say Ian McKeever relentlessly kept driving the horse, Ryder, on an 84-degree (29-degree Celsius) day in August 2022, despite signs that the animal was struggling to pull the carriage before he went down en route back to his barn.",
      "\u201cThe defendant chose to press on, business as usual, and overwork Ryder,\" prosecutor Taylor Maurer told jurors in her opening statement. The horse survived the fall but was euthanized some months later because of health problems.",
      "McKeever, 56, has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor animal cruelty charge. His attorney says the horse was properly cared for, wasn\u2019t overheated, and simply tripped and fell.",
      "\u201cRyder\u2019s fall is heartbreaking, but the evidence in this case is not going to show that Ryder fell because Ian overdrove him,\u201d the lawyer, Raymond Loving, said in his opening statement.",
      "Horse-drawn carriages have plied Central Park and the city's streets for over 150 years. Featured in countless movies and TV shows, they're a quaint attraction for many tourists and a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for activists who have long wanted them banned.",
      "Animal advocates say it's inhumane to have horses navigating Manhattan traffic. Over the years, some horses have gotten startled, run off and collided with cars or other objects. Others besides Ryder have collapsed on the job.",
      "Supporters of horse-drawn carriages see the coaches as a romantic remnant of a bygone New York. They also note that the carriages net tourist dollars and have provided hundreds of jobs to drivers, plus jobs for a glut of farm and racing horses.",
      "\u201cIf they did not come to New York City, most of these horses would be dead,\u201d McKeever told The Associated Press in 2014. He said some of his own carriage horses were going to go to slaughterhouses before he bought them.",
      "Perhaps improbably, horse-drawn carriages became a potent political issue about a decade ago, when mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio campaigned on a promise to eradicate them on his first day in office. The Democrat won in 2013 and got pushback from unions, newspaper editorials and other supporters of horse-drawn carriages. After two years, a compromise plan to limit the carriages' number and range was pulled off the agenda on the eve of a City Council vote.",
      "McKeever has been a carriage horse driver for 30 years. His attorney said Ryder belonged to the defendant's brother.",
      "The horse was outside for over seven hours on Aug. 10, 2022, mostly in Central Park. An onlooker, Caroline Londahl-Smidt, testified Tuesday that the horse appeared to her to be in \u201cmajor distress,\u201d walking slowly up a hill, as McKeever shook the reins and seemed to be trying angrily to speed him up.",
      "Later, the horse collapsed near Times Square during the evening rush hour. Bystander video published by the New York Post showed McKeever snapping the reins at him and telling him to get up.",
      "Ryder rolled onto his right side and laid on the pavement for nearly an hour, occasionally trying to rise as police cooled him with water and ice from nearby restaurants, according to testimony and body camera video from Sgt. Vincent Fontana of the police department's mounted unit. Officers tucked a pillow under the horse's head to protect his right eye from the pavement.",
      "Ultimately, the horse stood, walked into a trailer and was driven back to his stable.",
      "Fontana said McKeever told him the animal was 13, but prosecutors say he was considerably older.",
      "Through questioning, Loving emphasized that the horse's temperature was normal and his breathing was not much faster than normal when Fontana took his vital signs. He did so after officers had started hosing down the animal.",
      "McKeever is expected to testify later in the trial. If convicted, he could face up to a year in jail, though the charge also allows for alternatives such as fines or community service.",

      "The release of the transgender woman, identified in court filings as O-J-M, came after a federal judge in Oregon ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Monday to free her. In her order, U.S. District Judge Amy Baggio wrote that O-J-M had been deprived of her liberty by the government without procedural due process.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A drenching weather system moving across Florida on Tuesday wasn't even a tropical anything but has the potential to develop into a tropical depression as it moves into the northeastern and northern Gulf later in the week, according to National Weather Service forecasters.",
      "The system would be called Tropical Storm Dexter if it became a named storm, but it was expected to be far less lethal than the namesake vigilante serial killer of the Showtime crime drama, \u201cDexter\u201d which was set in Florida.",
      "The National Weather Service said the area of low pressure off Florida's east coast was becoming better defined and moving west across the Florida Peninsula on Tuesday. The system was drenching the peninsula with heavy rains, and the weather service warned of the potential for flash flooding in parts of the state through the middle of the week.",
      "\u201cEnvironmental conditions appear generally favorable for additional development, and a tropical depression could form by the middle to latter part of this week as the system moves across the northeastern and north-central Gulf,\u201d the National Weather Service said.",
      "Just six weeks into the start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, three tropical storms have developed \u2014 Andrea, Barry and Chantal. Dexter would be the fourth if it develops that way.",
      "Andrea dissipated in the Atlantic after forming at sea last month. Barry dumped rain on eastern Mexico at the end of last month. Chantal made landfall in South Carolina last week, and its remnants caused flooding in North Carolina that killed an 83-year-old woman when her car was swept off a rural road. Floodwaters also forced dozens of people to flee their homes in North Carolina.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in May forecast 13 to 19 named storms, with six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph). A normal season has 14 named storms, seven of which strengthen to hurricanes and three power up further to major hurricanes.",
      "Colorado State University researchers last month estimated there would be 17 named storms this year, with nine of them becoming hurricanes. Of the predicted hurricanes, the researchers said four could become major hurricanes.",
      "With hurricane season on Floridians' minds, state Attorney General James Uthmeier this week sent a letter to the state's airports telling them that they must report the presence of any aircraft used for the purposes of \u201cweather modification\" starting in October to comply with a new Florida law.",
      "After flash floods killed scores of Texas residents over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, social media users spread false claims that the devastation was caused by weather modification. Many pointed to one process in particular, blaming cloud seeding performed on July 2 by a California-based company for the tragedy. But officials say there is no evidence that the floods are the result of cloud seeding and experts agree that cloud seeding would not result in precipitation of this magnitude.",

      "FALL RIVER, Mass. -- A Massachusetts assisted-living center where nine residents died in a fire was cited for failing to immediately report more than two dozen health and safety incidents, according to regulators' most recent review of the facility.",
      "Five men and four women were killed and at least 30 others were injured Sunday night at Gabriel House in Fall River, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boston. Some of the 70 residents were rescued by ladder after screaming for help from the windows of the three-story building. The cause of the blaze is under investigation.",
      "The 100-unit facility, which opened in 1999 in a former motel built decades earlier, was last inspected by the state on Oct. 31, 2023, according to a report from the state Executive Office of Elder Affairs.",
      "The report cited the facility for seven deficiencies, four of which were repeat problems. After the facility responded with a corrective action plan, it was re-certified through November 2025.",
      "Most of the issues involved missing documentation. For example, seven resident files that were reviewed were missing documents to indicate that their service plans were reassessed within 30 days of moving in, as required. The plans outline the services each resident receives, including whether they need help with medication and meals.",
      "The review also found problems with the reporting of safety incidents. Facilities are supposed to submit reports of incidents that could have a significant negative effect on residents' health, safety or welfare within 24 hours, but the review found 26 reports that were sent later than that between May 5, 2022, and Oct. 31, 2023.",
      "The report did not specify the total number of incidents, or provide any details about what they involved.",
      "The state also watched two staffers provide medication assistance to seven residents and found several problems, including failure to document when eye drops were opened, loose tablets in medication storage areas and partially opened medication.",
      "Some residents said only two or three staffers were working at the time of the fire, and they offered little help.",
      "\"They left us alone and ran out into the parking lot,\u201d said Lorraine Ferrara. \u201cI was hanging out the window \u2014 \u2018Help! Help!\u2019 and they just kept running.\u201d",
      "Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts secretary of elder affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned about reports on the lack of fire drills, the small number of staff members for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible tragedy that should have never happened,\u201d Lanzikos said.",
      "Richard Moore, another co-founder of Dignity Alliance, has asked the attorney general to investigate based on similar concerns as well as the facility owner's history. Dennis Etzkorn, owner of Gabriel Care LLC, was indicted on medical assistance fraud and kickback charges in 2012, though the charges were dismissed three years later.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it happened in the past and that this now happened suggests that there should be a more thorough investigation of that,\" said Moore, former head of the Massachusetts Assisted Living Association and a former state senator.",
      "He said the assisted-living industry overall needs more rigorous regulation and oversight. And while it's too early to say what went wrong at Gabriel House, he said the staffing levels and training appear to have been inadequate.",
      "Current regulations do not require a specific number of staff members, but the rules say facilities \u201cshall have a plan to secure staffing necessary\u201d to respond to emergencies.",
      "\u201cThere should have been more staff. They should have been trained in the case of fire or other emergency,\u201d Moore said. \u201cQuarterly, they should have been doing fire drills. It seemed like residents didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "Etzkorn declined to comment to The Associated Press. He told the Boston Globe in a statement Monday that he and his family were \u201cdevastated by the tragedy\u201d and that he will continue to cooperate with authorities.",
      "By Tuesday morning, the facility's broken windows had been boarded up, and bouquets of flowers and a rosary were set on the ground against a post wrapped with yellow police tape.",
      "Ann O\u2019Neil-Souza, chief of staff for the mayor, said city officials expect to find homes for the survivors from Gabriel House by the end of Tuesday. She said most were being placed with other facilities in the city and with family, and hospitals have been asked to work with social workers to ensure patients find housing when they are discharged.",
      "The dead ranged in age from 61 to 86, authorities said. The Bristol County District Attorney\u2019s Office identified seven of the deceased as Rui Albernaz, 64; Ronald Codega, 61; Margaret Duddy, 69; Robert King, 78; Kim Mackin, 71; Richard Rochon, 78; and Eleanor Willett, 86.

      "New York City\u2019s subway system is fully operational following overnight heavy rains",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City\u2019s subway system was fully operational for the Tuesday morning commute, however some roads remained closed in sections of New York and New Jersey after heavy rain swept across the U.S. Northeast overnight, causing flash floods.",
      "Dozens of flights were delayed or canceled at area airports Tuesday, including 159 total cancelations at Newark Liberty Airport, according to FlightAware data.",
      "Most flash flood watches and warnings had expired in parts of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as the rain moved on, but a state of emergency declared by Gov. Phil Murphy remained in New Jersey, where video on social media showed cars still partially inundated in some parts of the state as residents worked to clean up.",
      "Delays were reported on part of the state\u2019s commuter rail line due to the severe weather.",
      "In New York, however, Janno Lieber, chair and CEO of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, told ABC 7 in New York there was now full subway service, as well as full Long Island Railroad and Metro North commuter rail service after hundreds of people worked overnight to restore operations.",
      "Video posted on social media appeared to show water flooding down into a Manhattan subway station, submerging the platform while passengers inside a train watch. Another photo appears to show passengers standing on a train\u2019s seats to avoid the water beginning to soak the floor.",
      "Lieber said the city\u2019s sewer system got overwhelmed by the rain and backed up into the subway tunnels and to the stations. In several cases, he said, the backup \u201cpopped a manhole,\u201d creating the dramatic \u201cgeyser\u201d seen in some videos.",
      "\u201cWhat happened last night is something that is, you know, a reality in our system,\u201d he told the TV station, noting the backup happens when more than 1 3/4 inches of rain falls in an hour. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the city of New York to try to get them to increase the capacity of the system at these key locations.\u201d",
      "In one flooded neighborhood in North Plainfield, New Jersey, authorities were investigating why a house caught on fire and collapsed and whether it was due to a possible explosion. It occurred not long after the family inside had evacuated, authorities said. No injuries were reported.",

    "story": [
      "A group of several dozen Indigenous youth from across the Klamath Basin recently emerged victorious after a month-long journey paddling the Klamath River",
      "KLAMATH, Calif. -- As bright-colored kayaks push through a thick wall of fog, voices and the beats of drums build as kayakers approach a crowd that has formed on the beach. Applause erupts as the boats land on the sandy spit that partially separates the Klamath River from the Pacific Ocean in northern California.",
      "Native American teenagers from tribes across the river basin push themselves up and out of the kayaks and begin to cross the sand, some breaking into a sprint. They kick playfully at the cold waves of the ocean they\u2019ve been paddling toward over the last month \u2014 the ocean that\u2019s seen fewer and fewer salmon return to it over the last century as four hydropower dams blocked their ideal spawning grounds upstream.",
      "\u201cI think our ancestors would be proud because this is what they\u2019ve been fighting for,\u201d said Tasia Linwood, a 15-year-old member of the Karuk Tribe, on Thursday night, ahead of the group's final push to the end on Friday.",
      "The Klamath River is newly navigable after a decades-long effort to remove its four hydropower dams to help restore the salmon run \u2014 an ancient source of life, food and culture for these paddlers\u2019 tribes who have lived alongside the river for millennia. Youth primarily from the Yurok, Klamath, Hoopa Valley, Karuk, Quartz Valley and Warm Springs tribes paddled 310 miles (499 kilometers) over a month from the headwaters of the Wood River, a tributary to the Klamath that some tribes consider sacred, to the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The teens spent several years learning to navigate white water through Paddle Tribal Waters, a program set up by the nonprofit Rios to Rivers, to prepare local Native youth for the day this would be possible.",
      "During their last days on the water, the group of several dozen swelled to more than 100, joined by some family members and Indigenous people from Bolivia, Chile and New Zealand who face similar challenges on their home rivers.",
      "Starting in the early 1900s, power company PacifiCorp built the dams over several decades to generate electricity. But the structures, which provided 2% of the utility\u2019s power, halted the natural flow of a waterway that was once known as the third-largest salmon-producing river on the West Coast.",
      "With the dams in place, tribes lost access to a reliable source of food. The dams blocked the path to hundreds of miles of cool freshwater streams, ideal for salmon returning from the ocean to lay their eggs. Salmon numbers declined dramatically along with the water quality.",
      "In 2002, a bacterial outbreak caused by low water and warm temperatures killed more than 34,000 fish, mostly Chinook salmon. That galvanized decades of advocacy by tribes and environmental groups, culminating in 2022 when federal regulators approved a plan to remove the dams.",
      "Through protests, testimony and lawsuits, the tribes showcased the environmental devastation caused by the dams, especially to salmon. From 2023 to 2024, the four dams were dynamited and removed, freeing hundreds of miles of the Klamath.",
      "The renewable electricity lost by removing the hydropower dams was enough to power the equivalent of 70,000 homes, although PacifiCorp has since expanded its renewable sources through wind and solar projects.",
      "Two dams used for irrigation and flood control remain on the upper stretch of the river. They have \u201cladders\u201d that allow some fish to pass through, although their efficacy for adult salmon is questionable. On the journey, the paddlers got out of the river and carried their kayaks around the dams.",
      "The journey began June 12 with ceremonial blessings and kayaks gathered in a circle above a natural pool of springs where fresh water bubbles to the surface at the headwater of the Wood River, just upstream of the Klamath River.",
      "The youth camped in tents as they made their way across Upper Klamath Lake and down the Klamath River, jumping in the water or doing flips in their kayaks to cool down in the summer heat. A few kayakers came down with swimmer's ear, but overall everybody on the trip remained healthy.",
      "Nearly everyone had a story to share of a family\u2019s fishing cabin or a favorite swimming hole while passing through ancestral territory of the Klamath, Modoc, Shasta, Karuk and Yurok.",
      "More than 2,200 dams were removed from rivers in the United States from 1912 through 2024, most in the last couple of decades as momentum grows to restore the natural flow of rivers and the wildlife they support, according to the conservation group American Rivers.",
      "\u201cI believe that it was kind of symbolic of a bigger issue,\u201d said John Acuna, member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe and a leader on the trip.",
      "The federal government signed treaties with these tribes outlining their right to govern themselves, which is violated when they can't rely on their traditional food from the river. Acuna said these violations are familiar to many tribal communities, and included when his great-grandmother was sent to boarding school as part of a national strategy to strip culture and language from Native Americans.",
      "That history \"comes with generational trauma,\u201d he said.",
      "Their treaty-enshrined right to fish was also blatantly disregarded by regional authorities in the 1970s but later upheld by various court decisions, said Yurok council member Phillip Williams.",
      "Standing on a fog-shrouded boat ramp in the town of Requa awaiting the arrival of the youth, Williams recounted the time when it was illegal to fish here using the tribes' traditional nets. As a child, his elders were arrested and even killed for daring to defy authorities and fish in broad daylight.",
      "Fifty years later, with the hydropower dams now gone, large numbers of salmon are beginning to return and youth are paddling the length of the Klamath.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s a heaviness that I feel it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of people that lived all in these places, all these little houses here that are no longer here no more,\" said Williams. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to see what\u2019s happening today. And that\u2019s a heavy, heavy, feeling.\u201d",
      "Even as a teen, Linwood says she feels both the pleasure of a month-long river trip with her friends and the weight of the past.",
      "\u201cI kind of feel guilty, like I haven\u2019t done enough to be fighting,\u201d she said. \"I gotta remember that\u2019s what our ancestors fought for. They fought for that \u2014 so that we could feel this joy with the river.\u201d",

      "The neighborhood social site Nextdoor is hoping for a revival by turning to local news providers",
      "NEW YORK -- Nextdoor, the social media site that aims to create connections among neighbors, is trying to shake off an uneven past and a nagging sense it is being underutilized. How? It is turning to professional journalists for help.",
      "The company announced a partnership Tuesday with more than 3,500 local news providers who will regularly contribute material to the app. As part of a redesign, it is also expanding its ability to alert users about bad weather, power outages and other dangers, along with using AI to improve recommendations for restaurants, services and local points of interest.",
      "\u201cThere should be enough value that we are creating for neighbors that they feel like they need to open up Nextdoor every single day,\u201d said Nirav Tolia, the company's co-founder and CEO. \u201cAnd that isn't the case today.\u201d",
      "The potential for Nextdoor to help itself and journalists at the same time is most intriguing.",
      "Nextdoor is carrying portions of local news stories from providers in the area where the user lives. If people want to learn more, a link to the news site is included. At launch, Nextdoor says it has more than 50,000 news stories available, representing just over three-quarters of the app's \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d",
      "When Nextdoor began in 2011, the local news industry was in the early stages of a freefall that continues today. The number of journalists in the U.S. dropped from 40 per 100,000 residents in 2002 to slightly more than eight today, according to a study issued this month by Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News. Nearly a third of the nation's counties have no full-time journalist.",
      "Into this tumult came an app with a promising premise and infrastructure, perhaps a template for local news of the future. Its users \u2014 Nextdoor likes to call them \u201cneighbors\u201d \u2014 were organized into more than 200,000 distinct neighborhoods, with the ability to start conversations once shared over back fences: Do you know a reliable babysitter? What's that building going up down the street? Who serves the best burger?",
      "Yet Nextdoor's developers knew technology, not the news business. They didn't see a role for professional journalists at the outset.",
      "\u201cWe thought in our early days that neighbors would take over, almost as citizen journalists or local reporters,\u201d Tolia said. \u201cI think we've come to the conclusion that neighbors can only do so much.\u201d",
      "Even worse, the site became a magnet for racists and cranks, the kind of neighbors you try to avoid. Nextdoor became so filled with suspicion \u2014 why is a person of a different color or nationality walking down the street? \u2014 that its moderators had to spend considerable time rooting out racist posts and changing rules to prevent them.",
      "For some users, the negatives outweighed the positives.",
      "\u201cNextdoor has been a valuable resource for my family,\u201d Ralinda Harvey Smith, a woman from Santa Monica, Calif., wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2020. \u201cI found a nanny share for my kids on Nextdoor. When I posted looking for a mechanic to replace my car headlight, a neighbor offered to change it free of charge. When the pandemic struck and disinfectant wipes were impossible to come by, a woman on Nextdoor DM'd me offering to leave some on her porch.\u201d",
      "\u201cYet I've long seen remnants of racism across the site that have left me with a bad feeling not only about the app, but the city I love,\u201d Smith wrote. That made her log on less frequently.",
      "Whatever the reasons, enough users consider Nextdoor inessential that its leaders were compelled to make the changes being announced now. The site has 100 million registered users, but only about 25 million are on the site at least once a week, Tolia said. Nextdoor, which went public in 2021 to attract a new round of financing, wants to see them more often.",
      "Nextdoor hired a former executive at The New York Times, Georg Petschnigg, as its chief design officer to oversee the changes.",
      "The company said its surveys found users wanted to know more about what was going on in their communities beyond the utilitarian information. Other social networks are similarly bringing in more outside material, Tolia said. \u201cWhen you rely on user-generated content, it\u2019s kind of unpredictable in terms of quality, timeliness and relevance,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be doing this. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t do it sooner, but that\u2019s for them to answer and not me,\u201d said Chuck Todd, the former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator who has taken an interest in local news since leaving NBC. Semafor this spring speculated Todd might be interested in buying Nextdoor. Todd wouldn\u2019t discuss that.",
      "He is waiting to see if Nextdoor has a real commitment to news or just to reaching more eyeballs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to do the one thing that Facebook could have done but chose not to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this to go down the road of just trying to get traffic for traffic\u2019s sake, because that\u2019s what happened to Facebook after it went public.\u201d",
      "The irony of engaging with professional journalists isn't lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like what is old is new again,\u201d said Sam Cholke, manager of distribution and audience growth for the Institute for Nonprofit News. Its hundreds of members include the Texas Tribune, the Plateau Daily News in Highlands, N.C., and the Daily Yonder in Whitesburg, Kentucky.",
      "Several of its participating news organizations are joining with Nextdoor, and \u201cmy hope is that our members see significant benefits from it,\u201d Cholke said.",
      "The local news industry continues to suffer from the same problems that have led to its downfall the past two decades: a dwindling number of readers and advertisers. An offhand comment by Tolia \u2014 about how people used to pick up \u201ca piece of dead tree\u201d from their driveways to get their news \u2014 speaks to fading prospects.",
      "Facebook's deemphasis of news on its platform and Google\u2019s increasing use of AI at the expense of referrals to news articles are adding to the death spiral, said Tim Franklin, head of the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern.",
      "\u201cIf Nextdoor is another vessel to get readers to news sites, and local news sites in particular, it would come at a real moment of vulnerability for local news organizations and would be a real opportunity,\u201d said Franklin, whose worry is that relying on third parties is unpredictable.",
      "Josh Schneps, who runs a series of local news operations in New York City and Long Island, like the Flushing Times and Park Slope Courier, has already had material appear on Nextdoor in a soft launch and is seeing an increase in traffic to the sites.",
      "\u201cI feel like media is in a state of evolution and there's no playbook,\u201d Schneps said. \u201cMy goal is to get our content in front of as many people as possible. I'm more than happy to be the guinea pig\u201d for Nextdoor, he said.",
      "An industry \u2014 and a company \u2014 both need help. Maybe they can help each other.",

      "Collier County, Florida, uses one of the most advanced 911 systems in the U.S., allowing callers to send texts and videos",
      "NAPLES, Fla. -- When an emergency happens in Collier County, Florida, the 911 calls go to one of the most high-tech communications centers in the U.S., where callers can send text and video from the scene to dispatchers.",
      "Moving to what's known as an NG911 \u2014 or Next Generation 911 \u2014 system is a journey Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and Bob Finney, the county's director of communication, have been on for much of the past decade.",
      "It's a long way from Feb. 16, 1968, when Alabama's then-House Speaker Rankin Fite made the nation's very first 911 call in Haleyville, Alabama, on a bright red, rotary-style landline telephone. That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number.",
      "Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers.",
      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

      "Mike Waltz will face questioning from lawmakers for the first time since he was ousted as national security adviser",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Mike Waltz, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will face questioning from lawmakers Tuesday for the first time since he was ousted as national security adviser in the weeks after he mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans.",
      "The former Republican congressman is set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, with Trump looking to fill his remaining Cabinet position after months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee.",
      "The hearing will provide senators with the first opportunity to grill Waltz over revelations in March that he added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen.",
      "Waltz took responsibility even as criticism mounted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who shared the sensitive plans in the chat that included several other high-level national security officials. Hegseth shared the same information in another Signal chat that included family, but Trump has made clear Hegseth has his support.",
      "Waltz was removed as national security adviser in May \u2014 replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 and nominated for the U.N. role.",
      "Trump praised Waltz in the announcement, saying, \u201cFrom his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation\u2019s Interests first.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, Waltz would be coming to the U.N. at a moment of great change. The world body is reeling from Trump's decision to slash foreign assistance \u2014 affecting its humanitarian aid agencies \u2014 and it anticipates U.S. funding cuts to the U.N. annual budget.",
      "Under an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy realignment, the White House has asserted that \"some of the U.N.\u2019s agencies and bodies have drifted\u201d from their founding mission and \u201cact contrary to the interests of the United States while attacking our allies and propagating anti-Semitism.\u201d",
      "With America being the largest United Nations donor, cutting U.S. funding to the U.N. budget would greatly impair operations.",
      "Facing financial instability, the U.N. has spent months shedding jobs and consolidating projects while beginning to tackle long-delayed reforms.

      "Florida plans to execute Michael Bernard Bell on Tuesday for a 1993 double murder outside a bar",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- A man who fatally shot a man and woman outside a Florida bar as part of an attempted revenge killing is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, which would be the 26th execution carried out in the U.S. this year.",
      "So far, 25 men have been executed in 2025, tying the number of executions in 2024 and 2018. The number of executions has largely trended downward nationally this century after peaking with 98 in 1999. From 1995 to 2006, there were an average of about 67 executions per year.",
      "Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to death for the murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith.",
      "Bell would be the eighth person put to death in Florida this year, with a ninth scheduled for later this month. The state executed six people in 2023, but carried out only one execution last year.",
      "Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma has killed two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee each have killed one.",
      "In December 1993, Bell spotted what he thought was the car of the man who fatally shot his brother earlier that year, according to court records. Bell was apparently unaware that the man had sold the car to West.",
      "Bell called on two friends and armed himself with an AK-47 rifle, authorities said. They found the car parked outside a liquor lounge and waited. When West, Smith and another woman eventually exited the club, Bell approached the car and opened fire, officials said.",
      "West died at the scene, and Smith died on the way to the hospital. The other woman escaped injury. Witnesses said Bell also fired at a crowd of onlookers before fleeing the area. He was eventually arrested the next year.",
      "Bell was later convicted of three additional murders. He fatally shot a woman and her toddler son in 1989, and he killed his mother's boyfriend about four months before the attack on West and Smith, officials said.",
      "Attorneys for Bell have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The lawyers argued in their state filing that Bell's execution should be halted because of newly discovered evidence about witness testimony. But justices unanimously rejected the argument last week and pointed to overwhelming evidence of Bell\u2019s guilt in a 54-page opinion.",
      "Bell's attorneys filed a similar petition with the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, but the panel has not yet issued a ruling.",

      "A Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife of 23 years by poisoning her protein shakes is on trial for murder",
      "DENVER -- A dentist on trial for allegedly killing his wife by poisoning her protein shakes had fallen in love with another dentist, was in financial straits and had bought various poisons in the lead up to her death, prosecutors said in the trial's opening statements on Tuesday.",
      "Craig, 47, allegedly used cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient in over-the-counter eye drops, to kill his wife of 23 years, Angela Craig, two years ago in suburban Denver.",
      "In a nearly full courtroom, Craig sat in a dark suit as Assistant District Attorney Ryan Brackley laid out the case against him and pointed out that Craig may have been motivated by the payout from his wife's life insurance.",
      "Angela Craig, 43, who had six children with James Craig, had gone in and out of the hospital over several days. Her worsening symptoms, including dizziness, vomiting and fainting, perplexed doctors. Craig gave his wife a final dose of poison after she had already been admitted to the hospital, Brackley said.",
      "\u201cHe went in that room to murder her, to deliberately and intentionally end her life with a fatal dose of cyanide,\" Brackley said. \u201cShe spends the next three days dying.\"",
      "After his arrest, Craig tried to conscript a fellow inmate and others into covering his tracks. That included requests to create false testimony and kill the lead investigator on the case in exchange for money, Brackley said.",
      "Craig, who shook his head at times when Brackley spoke, has pleaded not guilty to several charges, including first-degree murder.",
      "Craig's attorney, Ashley Whitham, said they aren't disputing that Angela Craig was sick, hospitalized or that poison was found in her system. But Whitham argued that the evidence didn't show that he poisoned and killed her.",
      "Whitham seemed to suggest Angela Craig may have taken her own life. Whitham repeatedly described Angela Craig as \u201cbroken,\" partly by Craig's infidelity and her desire to stay married, since they were part of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints. Hospital staff had said Craig had been caring and \u201cdoting\u201d while Angela Craig was in the hospital, said Whitham.",
      "The police's investigation was inadequate, said Whitham, and had been biased against Craig from the beginning. Investigators hadn't taken Angela Craig's laptop or found her journal in the search of the couple's home in Aurora, said Whitham, adding that only parts of the journal were later turned over to investigators.",
      "Whitham said the prosecution overdramatized Craig's financial problems. She refuted prosecutors' suggestion that Craig was so enamored with one of the women he had an affair with \u2014 a fellow dentist from Texas \u2014 that he was motivated to kill Angela Craig.",
      "\"That's simply not the case,\" Whitham said, adding that Craig had many affairs over the years that his wife knew about. \u201cHe was candid with Angela that he had been cheating.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Craig searched Google for \u201chow to make a murder look like a heart attack\u201d and \u201cis arsenic detectable in an autopsy,\u201d and that he tried to make it appear his wife had killed herself.",
      "Angela Craig was hospitalized several times. After the first time, she can be seen on home surveillance video accusing her husband of implying to medical staff that she was suicidal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your fault they treated me like I was a suicide risk, like I did it to myself, and like nothing I said could be believed,\u201d she said to her husband on the video.",
      "After Craig's arrest in 2023, prosecutors alleged that he sent a letter to his daughter, offered a fellow jail inmate $20,000 to kill the case's lead investigator and offered someone else $20,000 to find people to falsely testify that Angela Craig planned to die by suicide.",
      "Whitham told the jury to consider the credibility of those witnesses, calling some \u201cjailhouse snitches.\u201d",
      "In addition to first-degree murder, Craig has pleaded not guilty to the other charges, including solicitation to commit murder and solicitation to commit perjury.",
      "Craig remains in custody, according to jail records.",

      "Temporary protections allowing nearly 12,000 Afghans to work in the U.S. and avoid deportation are expiring",
      "WASHINGTON -- Temporary measures that allowed nearly 12,000 Afghans to work in the U.S. and be protected from deportation are expiring Monday as part of the Trump administration's efforts to make more people eligible for removal from the country.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security in May said it was ending Temporary Protected Status for 11,700 people from Afghanistan in 60 days. That status had allowed them to work and meant the government couldn't deport them.",
      "The number of Afghans protected by TPS is relatively small compared to the overall number of Afghans \u2014 about 180,000 \u2014 who have fled Afghanistan and come to the U.S. since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. It's also not clear how many of those 11,7000 covered by TPS have applied for or received other forms of protection like asylum that would keep them from being deported after Monday.",
      "But the removal of the protective status for Afghans has struck a chord with many advocates and volunteers because of the suggestion that it is safe for Afghans \u2014 many who helped the U.S. during its two-decade long war there \u2014 to go home.",
      "\u201cSince so many of those losing their protections served alongside U.S. forces, we should honor that service by upholding our promise to provide safety and ensure that they have an opportunity to thrive here. We urge Congress to protect Afghans by providing them permanent status \u2013 a commitment that is long overdue,\" Jennie Murray, President and CEO of the National Immigration Forum, said in a news release Monday.",
      "At the time that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended the temporary protected status for Afghans, the department wrote in the decision that the situation in their home country was getting better.",
      "\u201cThe Secretary determined that, overall, there are notable improvements in the security and economic situation such that requiring the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan does not pose a threat to their personal safety due to armed conflict or extraordinary and temporary conditions,\u201d according to the May announcement.",
      "Temporary Protected Status can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States. They can't be deported and can work legally but they don't have a pathway to citizenship.",
      "The status is inherently precarious because it is up to the Homeland Security secretary to renew the protections regularly \u2014 usually every 18 months. The first Trump administration tried to remove many of these temporary protected statuses but was largely foiled by the courts.",
      "This time around, the Trump administration has moved even more aggressively to remove the protections, thus making more people eligible for removal from the country. The administration has pushed to remove temporary protected status from people from seven countries with Venezuela and Haiti making up the biggest chunk of the hundreds of thousands of people losing their protections.",
      "Critics say that successive administrations essentially rubber-stamped these renewals regardless, and people covered by what\u2019s supposed to be a temporary status end up staying in the United States for years.",
      "CASA, a nonprofit immigrant advocates group, sued the administration over the TPS revocation for Afghans as well as for people from Cameroon - those expire August 4. A federal judge last Friday allowed the lawsuit to go forward but didn't grant CASA's request to keep the protections in place while the lawsuit plays out.",

      "U.S. District Judge Brian Buescher will ultimately decide whether to accept the plea agreement and will determine Slater's sentence.",
      "\u201cI conspired to willfully communicate national defense information to an unauthorized person,\u201d Slater said in a handwritten note on his petition to change his plea.",
      "Slater had access to some of the country's most closely held secrets, John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAccess to classified information comes with great responsibility,\" said Lesley Woods, the U.S. attorney for Nebraska, said in the same statement. \"David Slater failed in his duty to protect this information by willingly sharing National Defense Information with an unknown online personality despite having years of military experience that should have caused him to be suspicious of that person\u2019s motives.\u201d",
      "Slater retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 2020 and worked in a classified space at the base from around August 2021 until around April 2022. He attended briefings about the Russia-Ukraine war that were classified up to top secret, court documents say. He was arrested in March of 2024.",
      "In his plea agreement, he acknowledged that he conspired to transmit classified information that he learned from those briefings via the foreign dating website\u2019s messaging platform to an unnamed coconspirator, who claimed to be a woman living in Ukraine. The information, classified as secret, pertained to military targets and Russian military capabilities, according to the plea agreement.",
      "\u201cDefendant knew and had reason to believe that such information could be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of a foreign nation,\u201d the agreement states.",
      "According to the original indictment, the coconspirator regularly asked Slater for classified information. She called him, \u201cmy secret informant love!\u201d in one message. She closed another by saying, \u201cYou are my secret agent. With love.\u201d In another, she wrote, \u201cDave, I hope tomorrow NATO will prepare a very pleasant \u2018surprise\u2019 for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin! Will you tell me?\"",
      "Court documents don't identify the coconspirator, or say whether she was working for Ukraine or Russia. They also don't identify the dating platform.",
      "Amy Donato, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Omaha, said Monday that she couldn't provide that information. Slater's attorney, Stuart Dornan, didn't immediately return a call seeking further details.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Bestselling author Martin Cruz Smith (Nov. 3, 1942-July 11, 2025) was a reporter briefly after college, and also worked as a Good Humor man. \"That was the best,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002. \"I discovered that one other thing I could do besides sell stories was sell Popsicles.\"",
      "He wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.",
      "An international blockbuster, it inspired a film starring William Hurt. But the Soviets were not amused; Smith was blacklisted from the U.S.S.R. \"I could not get back in at that point. I was persona non grata,\" he said.",
      "But he worked his way onto a Soviet factory ship in the Bering Sea and somehow charmed the captain. Smith's brief stay aboard the Sulak, out of Vladivostok. became the basis of his sequel to \"Gorky Park,\" \"Polar Star.\"",
      "Arkady Renko would make appearances in a total of 10 novels, including \"Red Square,\" \"Havana Bay,\" \"Wolves Eat Dogs,\" \"Stalin's Ghost,\" \"Three Stations,\" \"Tatiana,\" \"The Siberian Dilemma,\" and \"Independence Square.\" What was billed as the final Renko novel, \"Ukraine Square,\" was published in July.",
      "Smith worked to keep himself interested as a writer because, he said, \"writing is so boring. I mean, you're up there alone, nobody's there, and sometimes you kind of swivel round just to see if anybody showed up, and no one ever shows up; it's just you. So, you know, if you aren't really fascinated by it, it's not going to happen.\"",
      "He abandoned his Russian hero for long periods over the years to tackle other characters and settings (including in \"Stallion Gate,\" \"Rose,\" and \"The Girl From Venice\"), but kept going back, in part to reflect on the changes in Russia between Brezhnev and Putin. While he was preparing for the release of his \"December 6\" \u2014 a non-Renko novel set in Tokyo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor \u2014 Smith said he could feel the presence of his most famous character lurking over his shoulder: \"You know, I can feel him sort of pacing; you know, smoking cigarettes and pacing \u2026 'When is he going to be done with this Japanese book and we can get back to work?'\""

    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:49:24 -0400",
    "summary": "The mosaic shows a pair of lovers who are partially undressed. The tile may have been in a bedroom floor, Pompeii officials said.",
    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

But if I turned it up just a little bit, my cousins would laugh ... that was where I discovered deadpan.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you turn on a TV or sit in a movie theater, it's likely you'll see one particular actor \u2026 and there's also a good chance you won't know his name: \"I'm walking from the subway to the theater and a woman \u2013 I was in Times Square, so she's obviously a tourist \u2013 she goes, 'Oh, my God, there's, hey, hey, hey, hey\u2026' Didn't even know the name!\"",
      "His name is Richard Kind, and he's quite happy being just a little famous.",
      "\"I'll walk down the street and somebody will go, 'Oh, you're a national treasure.' And then I pass 250 people who don't know who I am, and yet that person thinks I'm a national treasure!\" he said.",
      "National treasure Richard Kind has made a lot of people laugh, and sometimes, nap. I asked, \"When you're on the stage, do you ever look down and see somebody asleep?\"",
      "\"Sure!\"",
      "\"What's that feel like?\"",
      "\"I say, I don't blame you!\" he laughed.",
      "Over the years, Kind has shown up everywhere. Maybe you've seen him on \"Poker Face,\" or \"Mid-Century Modern,\" or \"Only Murders in the Building.\" He's also the announcer and sidekick on the Netflix talk show \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.\"",
      "For 45 years, he's worked on Broadway (earning a Tony nomination for \"The Big Knife\"), and in movies and television, to become a respected actor. But that wasn't always his goal. \"When I was young, lying in bed, dreaming of stardom, I wanted stardom,\" he said. \"I didn't wanna be a good actor; I wanted stardom.\"",
      "Kind thought he'd follow his father into his Princeton, N.J., jewelry business. \"That I'm an actor is so wrong,\" he said. \"I should have gone into my dad's store. I should be in business. I should have been a lawyer. I should have done what is expected of a suburban middle-class kid.\"",
      "He said growing up he was teased more than most: \"I was a fat kid. I bet I was a loser. I'd might have made fun of me!\"",
      "But at summer camp, a friend gave him what became an essential life lesson: \"He taught me how to laugh at myself,\" Kind said.",
      "\"Was that laugh-at-yourself-before-other-people-do a defense mechanism?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely. He was a fat kid, too, who then lost weight. I eventually lost weight. Still a fat kid even to this day. I'll never be a thin person\u2026. In my head, I'm a fat, fat person.\"",
      "In the 1970s, self-assurance developed on stage at Northwestern University, and at Chicago's legendary improv theater, the Second City. \"Six nights a week at Second City, that is my Harvard of acting,\" Kind said. \"Some people would say it's the Harvard of comedy. It's not. It was my Harvard of acting.\"",
      "Even with that on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there were still doubts: \"My dad used to ask my professors at school or my directors, and these were his exact words: 'Does he have it? Is he any good?' He would not trust himself to say, 'Oh, my son is a good actor.' He would ask somebody else, 'Is he a good actor?' What the hell? Look at me, I'm a good actor!\"",
      "Possibly his most memorable role to date: Bing Bong, an imaginary creature who ultimately sacrifices himself to save his young friend, Riley/Joy, in the Pixar film \"Inside Out.\" \"I died for her,\" Kind said. \"I died so that she might have a great life.\"",
      "According to John Mulaney, that moment \u2013 letting let go of the past, but remaining child-like \u2013 says a lot about Richard Kind. \"In many ways, by having him as our announcer, we've given our imaginary friend a place at a podium,\" Mulaney said. \"He's incredibly sweet, incredibly childlike, and a real man and a powerful actor, and a great father.\"",
      "And here's another of his many roles you may have missed: the science fiction comedy \"Sharknado 2: The Second One,\" in which tornadoes hurl sharks at New York City \u2013 and New York City doesn't take it lying down. \"I hit a shark out of the ballpark. Now that's something I don't think a lot of people have that on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. I do!\"",
      "It seems like almost every place you go, you'll bump into Kind. Here we are at a recent New York Mets charity poker event. \"I used to be very good at this,\" he said. \"Then, I had children and moved to New York. Children can ruin a poker game \u2026 Every time I bet, I'm like this, thinking, Well, how will I pay for my kids' college?\"",
      "In some ways, Kind's success is all about the risks he's taken. \"This business is very cruel to actors,\" he said. \"Truly, it's very cruel. Some people call it insulting. I don't call it insulting, but I do say it is cruel. How much did I make my first episode of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'? How much did I make?\"",
      "\"Not a clue,\" I said.",
      "\"Take a guess.\"",
      "\"First episode? $2,500?\"",
      "\"That's a good guess. $700!\" Kind said. \"You go in with the attitude that everybody who's casting this product wants to make 'Seinfeld money.' They wanna make a lot of money. I walk in saying, 'I can help you make this great. I am the right guy for this.'\"",
      "And with a flourishing career built on being exactly the right guy, Richard Kind is grateful just to be at the same table with other actors. \"I am parsley on a plate of meat and potatoes,\" he said. \"Now, I'm good. I look great there. I'm the freshest parsley! But they're meat and potatoes. What do I do? I help make the plate look great. That's fine. That's what I usually do. But I can be cut out. I'm just not necessary all the time. And I'm fine, fine, fine with that. I've made a career of it, haven't I?\"",

      "For co-curator and granddaughter Isca Greenfield-Sanders, a retrospective now on display in Manhattan is a chance for the world to brush up on \"Joop Sanders: The Last Abstract Expressionist.\" The exhibit at the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation runs until July 19.",
      "\"We could've done this show with 15 entirely different paintings,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"But we had favorites and we had must-haves.",
      "\"Abstract Expressionism is the first movement tracthat is homegrown in the United States that is an international art movement,\" she said. \"You look at a lot of the geometric work, it's quite figurative. It's very human. It teaches you about how you are holding yourself in space and how you are looking at it on the wall.\"",
      "Joop Sanders emigrated from Amsterdam to the U.S. at age 17. He was among the youngest to take part in the landmark 9th Street Show in 1951, sharing the same billing with more familiar names like Willem and Elaine de Kooning, who would become lifelong friends. Elaine and Joop even posed for each other back when they couldn't afford models.",
      "\"He was always in there and always making great work,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"I think often about what it must have been like keeping up with these guys who had been painting for quite a while already, and holding his own.\"",
      "But during that scene's formative years in the mid- to late-1950s, Sanders and his new family left for his native Holland, exhibiting all over Europe, before coming back to New York. It was when Abstract Expressionism was hot.",
      "\"A handful of the Ab Ex painters made money, and the truth is no one else did,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"He's still living his life as a human being, and he has a young family and his parents want to know their grandchildren. His family was very important to him.\"",
      "And important for Greenfield-Sanders, who learned how to paint from Grandpa Joop at eight years old. The exhibit is part of a grieving process to honor the artist who died in 2023.",
      "Of Joop Sanders' \"Dream of the Red Chamber,\" I asked, \"Can you imagine not having this in your life?\"",
      "\"No,\" Greenfield-Sanders replied. \"I always think of it as the red painting, but there are so many other colors. As a painter, I see some of his moves. They're so much movement \u2013 it's a dance.\"",
      "Joop Sanders died just short of his 102nd birthday. \"I was born on his 57th birthday, and he and I shared a birthday for the next 44 years,\" Greenfield-Sanders said.",

    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",
      "At least 19 states have considered legislation to remove, ban or make fluoride optional in public drinking water this year. One of fluoride's most prominent critics is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",
      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has\u00a0questioned\u00a0the validity of the NIH's report, noting it had \"important limitations,\" including the high fluoride levels, and that other reviews have come to different conclusions about fluoride's risks and benefits.",
      "The EPA in 2011\u00a0lowered\u00a0the recommended limit for fluoride in water to cut down on fluorosis \u2014 when spots appear on kids' teeth \u2014 and in the wake of a 2006\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Academy of Sciences that found a lifetime of overconsumption of fluoride can lead to weakened, brittle bones and teeth.",
      "At Arkansas' Fort Smith water system, Lance McAvoy, who oversees the system, told CBS News it's monitored 24/7.",
      "\"We actually take samples every 15 minutes to verify the online equipment,\" McAvoy said, adding there had never been an instance of significantly higher fluoride levels to date.",
      "Dentists such as Kenton Ross, who also serves as president of Arkansas' dental association, say the science supporting fluoride is indisputable.",
      "\"You're gonna see a 25% reduction in tooth decay,\" Ross said of adding fluoride to drinking water. \"We have over 75 years of research over community fluoridation.\"",
      "For dentists, losing fluoride could mean losing the battle against tooth decay.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Nind Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",

      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.7% last month, higher than last month's rate of 2.4%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. June's reading is the highest since February, when the CPI rose 2.8% on an annual basis.",

      "Food prices rose 3% on an annual basis last month, higher than the overall inflation rate. Items that have seen big cost increases since last June include eggs, which are up 27.3%, roasted coffee, which is up over 12.7%, and ground beef, which is up 10.3%.",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month predicted that tariffs could start to push up prices in the second half of the year.",
      "President Trump recently announced he would issue a flurry of new tariffs on over 20 countries, which he set will take effect on Aug. 1, extending the deadline of a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs that ended earlier this month.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge, said in a report that certain categories exposed to tariffs \u2014 ranging from apparel, home furnishings and appliances to footwear and toys \u2014 saw some upward pricing pressure. But other products vulnerable to higher levies, such as vehicles, remained stable.",
      "EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco estimates that roughly a third of the June rise in the CPI is attributable to higher tariffs.",
      "The muted CPI data from previous months indicates that companies have taken steps to offset the costs of tariffs, largely shielding consumers from price shocks. However, that could change.",
      "\"Strategies used by companies to avoid passing on cost increases to consumers are not eternal,\" Daco noted a report.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% if Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on govrernment protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Margetta Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Margetta Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as to check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "More than a dozen countries from Asia to the Middle East and South America are potentially in President Trump's crosshairs if he goes ahead with his threat to impose 100% tariffs on goods exported to the United States over their economic ties with Russia.",
      "\"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House, laying out a new ultimatum and deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire to end its war in Ukraine.",
      "The levies, he said, would be applied as \"secondary tariffs\" \u2014 not targeting Russia directly, but designed to increase Moscow's economic pain by pressuring its trade partners to stop buying or selling products in the energy, agriculture and weapons sectors with Russia.",
      "China and India became the world's first and second biggest importers of Russian oil in 2023 after Western sanctions were imposed against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The top post had previously been held by the 27-nation European Union.",
      "China and India, Asia's two biggest economies, now collectively import an estimated 85% to 90% of the seaborne crude oil sold by Russia's state-managed energy companies, which make up the bulk of its total exports.",
      "After launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin renegotiated prices with its trade partners, offering steep discounts on Russian oil compared to U.S. and European crude. NATO member Turkey is another major importer of Russian oil and natural gas.",
      "In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates \u2014   while not a major energy importer itself \u2014   serves as a financial hub for the international trade in Russian oil. Dubai is also a safe haven for Russian capital and oligarchs.",
      "In South America, agricultural powerhouse Brazil is the biggest purchaser of Russian fertilizer products, crucial to supporting its soybean, sugar and coffee exports.",
      "Vietnam and Thailand, both of which try to maintain diplomatic non-alignment in the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014   leaving them stuck in a delicate balancing act between their Eastern and Western trade partners \u2014  do have oil, natural gas, defense and tourism interests with Russia.",
      "Senior Russian officials were quick to downplay the threat of secondary sanctions against its trading partners, and to reject Mr. Trump's ultimatum as \"unacceptable.\"",
      "The president's remarks didn't cause any immediately apparent unease for Russian investors, either, possibly as Mr. Trump left a window of 50 days for some new agreement to take shape, and as he has a recent history of stepping back from previous tariff threats.",
      "After Mr. Trump warned of the possible 100% secondary tariffs, Russia's stock market rose 2.7%, and the value of the Russian rouble actually strengthened relative to the dollar.",

      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",

      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",

    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

      "Tesla heads to federal court in Miami on Monday to defend its Autopilot system in a wrongful death case involving the death of a 22-year-old college student.",
      "The lawsuit, originally filed in April 23, 2021, in the 11th Judicial Court of Florida in Miami-Dade County, builds on previous cases involving Tesla's Autopilot system. The plaintiffs, Dillon Angulo, and the family of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed in the accident, are requesting punitive damages and compensation for medical costs and other expenses.",
      "The fatal crash took place in April 2019 when a Model S Tesla equipped with the Autopilot technology struck a parked vehicle in Key Largo, Florida, killing Leon and gravely injuring Angulo.",
      "The trial will be a major test for the EV maker, which has had to contend with slumping sales and a hit to its stock price after CEO Elon Musk spearheaded the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He. has since stepped back from leading DOGE.",
      "The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Autopilot's reputation at stake",
      "According to recent court filings connected to the case, Tesla owner George McGee had the Autopilot function of his 2019 Tesla Model S activated as he was driving on a two-lane rural road in Key Largo on April 25, 2019. McGee dropped his phone as he was approaching an intersection, and lost sight of the road as he bent down to pick it up, court documents state.",
      "In that moment, McGee's car allegedly plowed through the T-shaped intersection at over 60 miles per hour, failing to brake before crashing into the side of a Chevrolet Tahoe truck parked on the side of the road. The accident killed Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who were standing by the truck, which he owned.",
      "At issue is whether the car's Autopilot system was defective and contributed to the death of Benavides. In a court filing, Todd Poses, one of the plaintiff's lawyer, claims that design defects in the car's Autopilot system failed to detect obstacles, such as the Chevy Tahoe, resulting in Benavides' death.",
      "Tesla's argument",
      "In its motion for summary judgment, filed on June 26, Tesla argues that the Autopilot feature \"did not make the car 'self-driving'\" and that McGee was aware \"that it was still [his] responsibility to operate the vehicle safely even with Autopilot activate.\"",
      "Said Tesla in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch:",
      "\"The evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla's Autopilot technology. Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. To his credit, he took responsibility for his actions because he was searching for his dropped cell phone while also pressing the accelerator, speeding and overriding the car's system at the time of the crash. In 2019 when this occurred, no crash avoidance technology existed that could have prevented this tragic accident.\"",
      "Mary Cummings, a professor of engineering at George Mason University and an expert on advanced driver-assistance systems, is likely to testify at the trial, documents from the lawsuit's docket indicate. McGee, the driver of the car, is also expected to testify.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

      "The Pentagon has signed on to use Grok, the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk's company xAI, as part of a new $200 million agreement that opens the door for its deployment across the federal government, the company announced Monday.",
      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",
      "The move aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence across the government. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has championed AI as a pillar of national security and innovation.",
      "Musk himself briefly served in the Trump administration earlier this year, overseeing the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before stepping down in May amid a public break with Mr. Trump over his sweeping tax and spending bill. Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",
      "Despite the rift, xAI has continued to expand its government work. The new offering includes custom national security tools, AI-powered science and health applications, and cleared engineering support for classified environments.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",
      "The posts were later deleted and xAI said it \"quickly\" patched the issue. One day later, xAI launched an upgraded version of Grok it described as a major leap forward. Musk also announced that Grok would be used in Teslas.",
      "But the latest version was not without kinks, too: Grok checked with Musk's views before answering a question, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Grok was introduced in late 2023 as a more unfiltered alternative to other chatbots like ChatGPT, and is already integrated into Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\"America is the world leader in AI,\" xAI said in Monday's post announcing the Pentagon deal. \"We're excited to contribute back to the country that made xAI uniquely possible here.\"",

    "summary": "New law reduces the number of federal student loan repayment options and caps how much individuals can borrow for higher education.",
    "story": [
      "The millions of Americans with student loans, who have already experienced whiplash in federal policy since the pandemic, must again brace for change.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump signed into law on July 4 overhauls the federal student loan system by reducing the number of repayment plan options down to two from seven and capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education.",
      "Here's how the new budget law will affect people with federal student loans.",
      "Repayment plan options",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out a number of existing federal student loan repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR.",
      "Current borrowers enrolled in programs to be eliminated will have until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. For the 7.7 million Americans enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan, interest collection will resume on Aug. 1, the Department of Education\u00a0announced\u00a0Wednesday.",
      "Beginning on July 1, 2026, new student loan borrowers will choose between one of two plans: a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. The standard repayment plan will allow student loan borrowers to make fixed payments over the course of 10 to 25 years.",
      "That approach \"condenses a maze of loan options into two,\" simplifying the repayment process, according to the White House.",
      "The Repayment Assistance Plan will allow borrowers to pay 1% to 10% of their income on a monthly basis, for up to 30 years, Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. That's a longer timeline than current IDR plans, which\u00a0are currently either 20 or 25 years.",
      "After the 30-year mark, the borrower's remaining loan balance will be canceled, as is currently the case after an individual's repayment window ends.",
      "The five-year payment extension on income-based payments concerns Ba\u00f1ez, who said \"borrowers are going to be forced to be in repayment for even longer,\" she said.",
      "However, Sarah Reber, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, thinks the binary repayment options a \"huge improvement\" from a policy design perspective. The current system is confusing for borrowers given all the options from which they have to choose, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill gives families the freedom to choose the best education for their children while reforming a broken federal loan system to promote responsibility, affordability and opportunity,\" the White House said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Pell Grants",
      "The new law tightens eligibility rules for the Pell Grant program, the largest source of federal aid for low-income students. From 2021-2022, an estimated 92% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000,\u00a0according to Congress.gov.",
      "Under the law, students who receive a full scholarship from a college or university will no longer be eligible for additional funding through the Pell Grant program.",
      "By contrast, the law expands Pell Grant eligibility for students in workforce training programs. Previously, Pell Grants could only be used to pay for workforce training courses of less than 600 hours and 15 weeks, shutting out many short-term programs.",
      "That will enable \"Pell Grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who choose a career or technical education path for career advancement,\" the White House said.",
      "The budget law also increases scrutiny of the Student Aid Index, which is used to determine the size of an individual's federal aid eligibility. As a result, higher-income families will have a harder time getting Pell Grant funding, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).",
      "Borrowing caps",
      "The new law sets borrowing caps on certain loans beginning July 1, 2026.",
      "Parent PLUS loans \u2014 federal loans available for parents of dependent undergraduate students \u2014 will now be restricted to $20,000 a year and a total cap of $65,000. That's a change from the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid an individual receives.",
      "The new law also does away with\u00a0Grad PLUS loans,\u00a0which help people finance higher education degrees. Starting July 1, 2026, new students will no longer be able to apply for the loans. However, current borrowers will be grandfathered and still allowed to access the loans, according to EdSource.",
      "With the elimination of Grad PLUS loans, graduate students in need of federal tuition assistance will have to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Those seeking unsubsidized federal loans for professional degrees, such as law or medicine, will be restricted to $50,000 per year and a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in nonprofessional areas, such as history or philosophy, will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Economic hardship, unemployment deferment",
      "Currently, student loan borrowers can apply for up to three years of deferment based on economic hardship or unemployment, according to the Federal Student Aid website.",
      "Starting July 1, 2026, the new law eliminates deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship. For example, someone who falls behind on the bills because of job loss would no longer qualify to defer student loan payments, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "According to the White House, the changes to the deferment rules will streamline the process while also better protecting students and taxpayers.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",

      "AI redefining the entry-level job",
      "Experts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change.",
      "\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"",
      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-copper-tariff-price/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 07:10:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Manufacturers and construction companies \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 would face higher prices if the U.S. jacks up tariffs on copper, analysts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-presidential-library-fundraising/",
    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 07:00:15 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News analysis finds that up to $63 million has been raised for Mr. Trump's future presidential library so far from legal settlements alone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's efforts to direct millions of dollars to his future presidential library has drawn fresh attention to a lack of visibility into the identities or potential interests of the donors who are funding it, a longstanding Washington concern facing past presidents from both parties.",
      "Two prominent Senate Democrats say they are preparing to introduce a bill Wednesday that would regulate fundraising for presidential libraries, according to documents shared with CBS News.",
      "\"Donald Trump is using his presidential library as a tool for bribery while he is still in office,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who is introducing the legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut.",
      "\"Many of the donations to Trump's future library are coming straight from companies and special interests that need a favor from Trump,\" Warren said. \"Right now there are no rules.\"",
      "The effort was spurred by a series of announcements about gifts to the Trump library, including an opulently-appointed Boeing 747\u00a0given to the U.S. Air Force by the Qatari royal family for the president's use, after which it would be donated to the library for Mr. Trump's post-presidency.",
      "The proceeds of four large legal settlements with the president are also reportedly bound for his library fund. The multimillion-dollar settlements stem from Mr. Trump's lawsuits against Meta, ABC News, X (formerly Twitter) and Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The funds from the four settlements alone could total up to $63 million, according to a CBS News review of news reports and court documents.",
      "Sens. Warren and Blumenthal, along with three House members, Reps. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) are proposing several measures to restrict fundraising for presidential libraries. Among them is a contribution cap of $10,000 per person while the president is still serving in office.",
      "The legislation also proposes quarterly disclosures for all donations of $200 or more, and imposes a two-year \"cooling off\" period after the end of their term during which a president cannot accept donations from foreign nationals, federal government contractors or individuals seeking presidential pardons. Finally, the bill also explicitly bars the use of library donations for personal expenses.",
      "\"Right now, there are basically no rules,\" said Warren. \"The settlements show everyone who has business pending in front of the federal government, that if they've got enough money and can funnel it to Donald Trump through his future presidential library, they might receive better treatment from the US government.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Funding is largely opaque and unregulated",
      "The total amount raised for the Trump library to date is likely far greater than the amounts visible through the president's publicly announced legal settlements. For instance, funds leftover from the $239 million raised by the Trump-Vance inaugural committee \u2014 including millions from tech companies and CEOs such as Amazon, OpenAI, Apple and Uber \u2014 were expected to be redirected to the library, according to multiple news reports. It's unclear how much of those funds have already been transferred. Donations to inaugural funds are required to be reported publicly, whereas presidential libraries are under no such obligation.",
      "The $400 million jet the Trump administration accepted from Qatar in May is also slated to be transferred to the Trump library shortly before he leaves office.",
      "Other than those instances, the funding for the private foundations that support presidential libraries is largely opaque and unregulated, experts said.",
      "\"No one outside the organization knows who contributes to presidential library funds,\" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer who advises tax exempt organizations. \"That information is provided to the IRS, but is not made public.\"",
      "While campaign funds have historically been tightly regulated under a series of laws passed after the Watergate scandal, there are no restrictions on donations to presidential libraries, Kappel said. While in office, presidents can solicit unlimited library donations from anyone \u2014\u00a0 including foreign nationals, individuals seeking presidential pardons and corporations with federal contracts.",
      "\"The lack of transparency could raise the appearance of impropriety,\" said Kappel. \"No one will know who is making donations to the presidential library while the president is still in office and making government policy.\"",
      "Trustees of the two Trump library organizations and the Trump Organization did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Obama Presidential Foundation, which oversees the development of former President Barack Obama's library\u00a0in Chicago, was founded\u00a0in January 2014, a year after Obama's second term began. The foundation said it would disclose all donors and donations over $200 on a quarterly basis on their website in an effort to increase transparency. It was estimated in June 2021 that the center will cost roughly $700 million to construct.",
      "President George W. Bush's library foundation began fundraising efforts in the spring of 2009, after he left office. The foundation did not publicly disclose its donors. The cost of that effort clocked in at $250 million. The George W. Bush Presidential Center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, opened in 2013.",
      "The first presidential library was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938. Since then, presidential libraries are built and maintained with a mix of private and federal funds. Typically the library itself is constructed with private donations, and occasionally with support from local government or university partners. The library is then transferred to the federal government and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, which oversees the preservation of presidential documents and has a congressionally appropriated budget for maintaining the library structures.",
      "Two nonprofits behind the Trump library",
      "In the last year, the Trump family and associates have established two funds for presidential library donations, according to incorporation records reviewed by CBS News. Both are incorporated as nonprofits in Florida.",
      "The first, the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc., was created in December 2024, before President Trump was sworn in, and shortly after ABC announced it would donate $15 million to the future Trump library to settle a defamation claim the president brought against the network. According to incorporation documents, the fund was established by Jacob Roth, a Florida-based attorney who also filed the paperwork for both the Trump Vance Inauguration Committee Inc. and the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee Inc. in November. According to incorporation documents for the organization, the purpose of the fund is to \"to preserve and steward the legacy of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency.\"",
      "A few months later, in May, a second nonprofit was incorporated under the name Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. There are three listed trustees: Eric Trump; Tiffany Trump's husband, Michael Boulos; and James Kiley, a New York attorney who represented Mr. Trump between 2020 and 2022 during one of his legal battles against his niece, Mary Trump.",
      "This foundation was created to \"steward, preserve, and celebrate the legacy and historical record of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency,\" according to filings.",
      "There may not be rules for what money can go into a presidential library fund, but there are strict rules for how nonprofit funds can be spent.",
      "As nonprofit 501(c)(3)s, tax laws prohibit the use of funds from a presidential library for personal benefit. The IRS is in charge of enforcing all conflict-of-interest laws for nonprofits, although experts are skeptical about the agency's political will to enforce those provisions.",
      "\"501(c)(3)s are supposed to be used for charitable purposes. To the extent funds are being used beyond that, and outside the scope of a presidential library, that's something the IRS would have to look into,\" said Viriginia Canter, who served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "There is no indication that Mr. Trump or his family are using funds for the libraries for personal expenses.",
      "Past library controversies",
      "The Trump family is not the first to face criticism over donations to a library fund while in office. President Bill Clinton faced significant pushback after he pardoned billionaire businessman Marc Rich, who'd fled to Switzerland after he was indicted in 1983 on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with Iran during an embargo and evading more than $48 million in U.S. income taxes.",
      "Clinton's pardon \u2014 which was issued just hours before he left office in January 2001 \u2014 faced scrutiny even from some of his closest allies, who said Rich's pardon appeared to have been bought. They pointed to the $450,000 donation Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, bestowed to the Clinton library foundation and the additional $100,000 she donated to Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign.",
      "And in 2008, a GOP lobbyist with ties to the Bush administration was caught on video allegedly soliciting a donation for his presidential library in exchange for setting up a meeting with top White House officials. (It was a sting operation set up by a newspaper; no money changed hands.)",
      "Congress has tried, and largely failed for almost two decades, to pass legislation that would require organizations raising funds for presidential libraries to disclose donations. Since 2007, the House has passed five bills regarding presidential library funding transparency \u2014 the most recent being in 2019 \u2014 but they have all been stalled in the Senate.",

      "President Trump and many leaders of the country's largest   technology and energy companies announced more than $90 billion in new investments\u00a0from private companies for Pennsylvania on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 30 minutes during a roundtable discussion at the\u00a0Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit\u00a0at\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, said 20 \"leading technology and energy companies\" will invest in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy, capitalizing on Pennsylvania's technology and energy assets.",
      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump intends to sign an executive order in the coming days establishing national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image and Likeness program, which has reaped millions of dollars in revenue for top college athletes, according to multiple people familiar with his plans.",
      "College athletes can now make millions before ever going pro thanks to a set of NCAA rules enacted in 2021 that relaxed previous restrictions on being compensated for playing or accepting endorsement deals. Student athletes can now profit from merely showing up to play, or from jersey sales, autographs or serving as spokespeople for companies ranging from global brands to car dealerships near campus.",
      "Mr. Trump is engaging on an issue that has quickly reshaped and, in many ways, roiled college athletics after a House subcommittee on Tuesday advanced a bill along party lines that would establish national standards for sponsorships. The legislation, called the \"SCORE Act,\" would supersede a patchwork of state laws regulating Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL.",
      "While the bill has bipartisan support, there is also bipartisan concern it would give too much power to the NCAA and do little to protect the interests of college athletes.",
      "The NCAA's decision in 2021 to let athletes earn money from NIL deals followed years of political and legal pressure on the collegiate sports giant. For decades, the NCAA imposed steep limits on compensation for student athletes, which it argued were necessary to insulate college athletics from commercial pressures. But opponents \u2014 including many college athletes \u2014 had long argued the rules unfairly cut them out of the millions in revenue that sports like football and basketball can bring in for universities.",
      "Last month, in a massive shakeup, a federal judge signed off on a legal settlement in which the NCAA agreed to let schools pay student athletes directly.",

    "summary": "As it seeks to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has sent some migrants to far-flung places that aren't their home countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday said it deported a group of men convicted of violent crimes to the small African country of Eswatini, in its latest expansion of deportations to far-flung places that are not deportees' home countries.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the deportees hailed from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen, and had been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. The men's criminal records included convictions for murder, homicide and child rape, McLaughlin added.",
      "The deported men, McLaughlin said, are \"so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.\"",
      "It's unclear what will immediately happen to the men sent to Eswatini, a landlocked country in southern Africa that was formerly known as Swaziland. The tiny nation is slightly bigger in size than Connecticut, has around 1.2 million residents and is ruled by a king.",
      "CBS News reported in early May that the U.S. had asked Eswatini, alongside other countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, to receive deportees who are not their own citizens. The talks are part of a larger, aggressive effort by the Trump administration to persuade as many countries as possible \u2014 regardless of their human rights record \u2014 to accept citizens of other nations, including criminals.",
      "President Trump's administration has already used agreements to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador; migrants from Africa and Asia to Costa Rica and Panama; and eight convicted criminals from Asian and Latin American countries to conflict-ridden South Sudan.",
      "Trump administration officials have persuaded other nations, like Honduras and Kosovo, to accept deportees from other countries, though those agreements have not been fully implemented yet. U.S. officials have approached other nations \u2014 including Moldova, Libya and Rwanda \u2014 to strike similar deals.",
      "Historically, the U.S. has sought to deport unauthorized immigrants to third countries if they hail from nations where it's difficult or impossible to deport them, such as those that limit or entirely reject U.S. deportations.",
      "The practice is controversial. Critics say some of the third countries that the Trump administration has turned to \u2014 like South Sudan \u2014 are unsafe, and deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador has sparked legal and humanitarian concerns since the deportees have been held incommunicado at a notorious mega-prison, despite many of them lacking any apparent criminal record.",
      "The administration's campaign to increase deportations to third-party countries gained a major legal victory last month, when the Supreme Court suspended a ruling by a federal judge in Boston that had required the U.S. to give detainees a certain degree of notice and due process before any deportation to a place that was not their country of origin.",
      "That now-suspended lower court order had required officials to give detainees and their lawyers notice of the third country the government wanted to remove them to, as well as a chance to contest their deportation, including by raising fears of being harmed or tortured in that nation.",
      "Soon after the Supreme Court's orders, the administration issued guidance aimed at expediting deportations to third countries by making it harder for would-be deportees to contest their deportation from the U.S.",
      "The directive, authored by acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, said detainees with final orders of deportation can be deported to third-party countries, without any notice or further proceedings, if those nations make \"credible\" assurances to the U.S. that they will not persecute or torture the deportees.",
      "If those assurances are not received or are not deemed credible, Lyons' memo instructs ICE officials to give detainees 24-hour notice of the agency's intention to deport them to a third country. But the guidance says ICE officials can give just 6 hours of notice in \"exigent circumstances,\" so long as the detainees are given \"reasonable means and opportunity\" to talk to an attorney.",
      "During those notice periods, detainees will have the burden of expressing fear of being harmed in a third country to try to contest their deportation. ICE officials will not affirmatively ask detainees about any potential fears, the Lyons memo says.",

    "summary": "Some senators have concerns as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act on the rescissions request.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate narrowly advanced a request from the White House to claw back billions in funds for international aid and public broadcasting, as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act.",
      "The request, known as a rescissions package, cleared its first procedural hurdles late Tuesday, with the help of Vice President JD Vance. The vice president cast two tie-breaking votes after three Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing it.",
      "In June, the White House requested that Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding that had previously been approved for spending, starting the clock on a process that gives lawmakers 45 days to act. If both chambers don't approve an identical package before the deadline, the funding will be spent as planned.",
      "The legislation seeks to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts, with the primary focus being slashing foreign aid. But it would also effectively cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, appeared uncertain if he had the votes to advance it, but moved ahead with a pair of procedural votes later in the day.",
      "Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against moving forward.",
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought met with Senate Republicans as some members remained resistant to pulling back all of the funding. Vought left the luncheon saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate the cuts to a global AIDS prevention program called PEPFAR.",
      "\"There is a substitute amendment that does not include the PEPFAR rescission and we're fine with that,\" Vought told reporters, referring to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.",
      "Vought said the package would total $9 billion with the change and is \"substantially the same package.\"",
      "\"We hope that if we can get this across the finish line in the Senate, that the House would accept that one small modification,\" Thune said.",
      "Last month, the House approved the White House's original request, overcoming opposition from all Democrats and four Republicans.",
      "But the change wasn't enough for the holdouts, who said they hadn't been provided specifics about how certain programs will be affected.",
      "\"We've got big, broad categories, but I haven't been given the comfort, if you will, that we're not impacting maternal and child health, that we're not impacting HIV/AIDS, that we're not impacting nutrition programs and programs related to tuberculosis, malaria, polio, neglected tropical disease, pandemic prevention, family planning,\" Murkowski said, adding that she also a strong supporter of public broadcasting.",
      "\"But more important than all of that, more important is our role here. I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told this is the priority we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round. I don't accept that.\"",
      "The rescissions package",
      "The rescissions request would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with other international assistance programs \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects. Also included in the package is a proposed $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "But some Senate Republicans have opposed components of the package, like cuts to a program aimed at combating HIV and AIDS globally.",
      "Started by former President George W. Bush, PEPFAR has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters last week that she wants to strike the PEPFAR rescissions, saying, \"I can't imagine why we would want to terminate that program.\"",
      "Collins, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, pushed back when Vought testified to the panel in June that \"no lifesaving treatment will be impacted by this rescissions package\" and that \"anyone currently receiving lifesaving treatment will continue to receive that treatment.\"",
      "\"When you look at PEPFAR, you are eliminating a lot of the prevention programs,\" Collins said, also questioning whether the package would harm efforts to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, polio and malaria and what effects it would have on maternal and child health programs that help feed malnourished children. \"Those are all programs that have been proven effective.\"",
      "\"These are not only the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons, but they're incredible instruments of soft power,\" Collins said.",
      "Collins on Tuesday said the PEPFAR changes announced by Vought were \"progress,\" but called for more specifics on other cuts.",
      "Others have raised concerns about cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they take on added significance as a means of communicating emergency messages.",
      "One of the Republican members who had concerns, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said Tuesday he would back the bill after working with the Trump administration to find alternate funding.",
      "\"We wanted to make sure tribal broadcast services in South Dakota continued to operate which provide potentially lifesaving emergency alerts,\"\u00a0Rounds posted on X. \"We worked with the Trump administration to find Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.\"",
      "Amending the package will mean the House will have to sign off on the changes. And with the Friday deadline, time is running out to do so before the request expires. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday he hoped the Senate sticks with the House-approved package.",
      "\"I think you've got to respect the White House's request, and that's what we did,\" Johnson said.",
      "In the Senate, rescissions bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, requiring only a simple majority. But with just 53 Republicans, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose a handful of their members to approve the package.",
      "President Trump weighed in on the rescissions push late last week, saying in a post on Truth Social that it's \"very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill,\" citing the public broadcasting cuts in particular. The president warned that any Republican who doesn't support the clawback in funding \"will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the rescissions push has sparked frustration among Democrats, who have little ability to stand in its way. But an upcoming spending fight is another story. Democrats have begun suggesting that the GOP effort to claw back already approved congressional funds could have an impact on their willingness to work across the aisle on government funding down the road.",
      "Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The rescissions process allows Congress to cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned about the upcoming rescissions push in a letter to his colleagues upon the return from the Fourth of July recess, arguing that the package's passage \"would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process.\" The New York Democrat called it \"absurd\" for the GOP to expect Democrats to engage in a bipartisan appropriations process that could be undermined by rescissions.",
      "\"Republicans are, in effect, proposing Congress negotiate bipartisan deals in the Committee room, while they retreat to a backroom to rubberstamp President Trump's purely partisan scheme that only needs a simple majority to pass to tear up those very same agreements,\" Schumer wrote.",
      "In response, Thune said on the Senate floor last week that he was \"disappointed\" to see Schumer \"implicitly threaten to shut down the government,\" while adding that he's \"hopeful that that is not the position\" of Senate Democrats.",
      "When asked by reporters about the possibility of a shutdown, Schumer said, \"Ask the Republicans why they are heading on this path.\"",
      "\"We are doing everything we can to keep the bipartisan appropriations process going, and they're undermining it with rescissions,\" Schumer added.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is releasing thousands of California National Guard troops from a federal mission in Los Angeles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is releasing thousands of California National Guard members from a federal mission in Los Angeles, the Pentagon said Tuesday, over a month after President Trump deployed the troops \u2014 over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections \u2014 to respond to protests in the nation's second-largest city.",
      "\"Thanks to our troops who stepped up to answer the call, the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "Around 2,000 Guard troops will be released, Parnell said, or half of the roughly 4,000 who were brought under federal control. About 700 active-duty Marines were also sent to the Los Angeles area last month, part of an effort to protect immigration agents and federal property.",
      "Separately, around 150 Guard members were returned to the state of California earlier this month to help fight wildfires.",
      "In response to Tuesday's decision, Newsom called on the Trump administration to also return the remaining Guard forces.",
      "\"For more than a month, the National Guard has been pulled away from their families, communities and civilian work to serve as political pawns for the President in Los Angeles. While nearly 2,000 of them are starting to demobilize, the remaining guardsmembers continue without a mission, without direction and without any hopes of returning to help their communities,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration argued the deployment was needed to deal with chaotic protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests. But Newsom and other local politicians called the deployment unnecessary and warned it could escalate tensions.",
      "The federal government also accused local law enforcement of not doing enough to protect ICE, which local officials denied.",
      "Mr. Trump took the forces under federal control in early June, following protests against ICE action in Los Angeles. The president said the 60-day mission was intended to quell \"violence and disorder\" and help protect ICE agents and federal property. He invoked a law known as Title 10, which says the president can call Guard troops into federal service to deal with a \"rebellion\" or if \"the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration, calling the deployment an \"unprecedented power grab\" and arguing it was illegal for Mr. Trump to federalize the Guard without his permission. A federal judge initially sided with Newsom, but an appellate court ultimately allowed Mr. Trump to keep the troops in Los Angeles while the legal battle played out, saying the president likely acted within his authority.",
      "During a visit to Los Angeles late last month, Vice President JD Vance called the Guard forces and Marines \"very much a necessary part of what's going on here,\" though he noted the situation in the city had \"gotten a lot better.\"",
      "The vice president also suggested Mr. Trump is willing to send Guard forces to other locales in the U.S. \u2014 but the administration would try not to do so.",
      "\"If you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary,\" the vice president said at the time.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Nind Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",

      "Russia has rejected President Trump's \"ultimatum\" for Moscow to sign a ceasefire deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days on Tuesday as \"unacceptable,\" calling for continued negotiations and insisting that the invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin would continue until its goals are achieved.",
      "In response to President Trump's threat to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries that do business with Russia if Putin's government does not agree to a deal to end the war in that timeframe, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Tuesday that \"any attempts to make demands, especially ultimatums, are unacceptable to us,\" according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.",
      "\"We need to focus on political and diplomatic work. The President of the Russian Federation has repeatedly said that we are ready to negotiate and the diplomatic path is preferable for us,\" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. \"If we cannot achieve our goals through diplomacy, then the SVO (war in Ukraine) will continue\u2026 This is an unshakable position. We would like Washington and NATO as a whole to take it with the utmost seriousness.\"",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov separately called Mr. Trump's announcement \"quite serious.\"",
      "\"Some of it is addressed personally to (Russian) President Putin. We definitely need time to analyze what was said in Washington,\" Peskov said during his daily briefing on Tuesday. \"If and when President Putin deems it necessary, he will definitely comment on it. I would not want to get ahead of ourselves, so let's wait for Putin's decision on whether he will comment on it himself.\"",

      "Speaking Monday in the Oval Office alongside visiting NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Mr. Trump said: \"We are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.\" He also announced a deal for the U.S. to sell additional weapons to its NATO allies, with the understanding that they will then send the weapons to Ukraine.",
      "\"We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"This is really big,\" Rutte said. \"And the decision is that you want Ukraine [to have] what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical.\"",

      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",
      "At least 19 states have considered legislation to remove, ban or make fluoride optional in public drinking water this year. One of fluoride's most prominent critics is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",
      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has\u00a0questioned\u00a0the validity of the NIH's report, noting it had \"important limitations,\" including the high fluoride levels, and that other reviews have come to different conclusions about fluoride's risks and benefits.",

The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to hold a vote on Bove's nomination for a seat on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday.",

      "In the memo, the former prosecutors accuse Bove of executing mass firings inside the agency of people \"perceived not to show sufficient loyalty to the Administration's policies.\" They also point to a whistleblower complaint accusing Bove and others of discussing whether to ignore court orders.",
      "The group also argues Bove sought to execute a quid pro quo earlier this year, by forcing out Justice Department employees who refused to work to dismiss New York Mayor Eric Adams' \"serious criminal corruption indictment in return for the mayor's commitment to cooperate with the Administration's immigration policy.\" Bove has denied that Adams' prosecution was dropped as part of a quid pro quo.",
      "Dan Toomey, a former federal prosecutor in Washington, is helping to lead the effort and is among the signatories to the memo. Toomey is a former president of the D.C. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Association.",

      "The former prosecutors are asking Judiciary Committee leaders to delay any vote on Bove until the panel can hear testimony from a Justice Department whistleblower who has alleged Bove sought to defy court orders.",

Among those officials was Bove.",
      "\"To ensure that the committee is not accused of 'rubber stamping' this nomination, it has to hear from the whistleblower and review the contemporary and damning documentation he's provided,\" Toomey said.",
      "The Justice Department defended Bove in response to Reuveni's allegations. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said his account contains \"falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,\" and \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "Former federal prosecutors focus on Tillis",
      "Documents reviewed by CBS News showed the group has attempted to press Tillis to \"come to the rescue of the rule of law and oppose the nomination of Emil Bove to the Third Circuit.\"",
      "Tillis told CBS News on Tuesday that Bove \"has the votes\" to move through the Senate Judiciary Committee, after which the Senate would vote on his nomination. But Tillis said he is unsure if Bove has sufficient votes to pass in the Senate. Tillis did not mention any objections he had to Bove's nomination. Tillis has told reporters in the past he's likely to vote in favor of Bove.",
      "Tillis \u2014 who is not running for reelection next year \u2014 has occasionally broken with Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier this year, Tillis objected to the nomination of Trump surrogate and former Jan. 6 defense lawyer Ed Martin for the top federal prosecutor position in Washington, D.C. Tillis has also criticized Trump surrogates who deny the violence against police in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",

      "\"Emil Bove is an incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge. Bove is unquestionably qualified for the role and has a career filled with accolades, both academically and throughout his legal career, that should make him a shoo-in for the Third Circuit,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields told CBS News earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2013 A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday reintroduced a comprehensive bill to reform the immigration system and create a potential pathway to legal status for long-term undocumented immigrants.",
      "Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar, Republican of Florida, and Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, announced the legislation, known as the DIGNITY Act, at a press conference alongside more than a dozen co-sponsors.",
      "\"We have 10 million people or more working in construction, hospitality, agriculture, dairy, fisheries, slaughterhouses who are undocumented but are not criminals,\" Salazar told reporters. \"No more need to choose between amnesty or deportation. The Dignity bill is the answer!\"",
      "The measure would establish a \"Dignity Program\" to grant legal status, including work and travel authority, to undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States for at least five years. Eligible applicants would have to pass a criminal background check, pay taxes and submit $7,000 in restitution over the duration of the seven-year program. After completion, they could renew their status indefinitely to stay and work in the U.S. as long as they meet the criteria. Participants would not be eligible for federal benefits or entitlements.",
      "\"Congress has not passed comprehensive immigration reform in our country in nearly four decades,\" Escobar said. \"This bill addresses long standing, long overdue legislation that will benefit our Dreamers, some of the most important young people in our country who by no choice of their own are here and know no other land than America. This will help American families who are married to an undocumented spouse who have long sought relief through the courts, through law. This will help millions and millions of people who are a critical component of the American economy.\"",
      "The bill makes additional investments to border security and enforcement but would protect sensitive locations from enforcement activities without prior approval, such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. It would also cut visa backlogs and reform the asylum program by expediting processing of asylum seekers with determinations made within 60 days. The bill also includes a $70 billion fund for training American workers.",
      "The legislation comes as the Trump administration faces increasing scrutiny over its mass deportation program. Last week a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily halt indiscriminate immigration raids in Los Angeles and other California counties. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said \"federal agents will continue to enforce the law and abide by the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "A group of farm workers in California is calling for a three-day national strike beginning Wednesday to protest the ICE raids. They're also demanding immediate citizenship for farm workers and encouraging a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Organizers hope the effort to boycott produce products and companies that employ undocumented immigrants will put more pressure on the Trump administration.",
      "\"The immigrant communities across America are terrified,\" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\u00a0 \"They are really scared out there. Some of the kids are skipping school. Families are being separated. We are fighting together trying to bring consensus, trying to bring dignity and security for families across America.\"",

    "story": [
      "An appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking deportation protections and work permits for thousands of people from Afghanistan.",
      "The administration had planned to end temporary protected status for Afghanistan on Monday, part of a broader push to cut back a program that gives migrants reprieve from deportation if their home country is deemed unsafe. The administration argues those protections aren't meant to be permanent and Afghanistan's security situation has improved, though opponents say the country remains unsafe and revocation would force people to uproot their lives.",
      "But in a late-night ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit blocked the administration from putting into place its withdrawal of temporary protected status for one week. The court's administrative stay didn't weigh in on the merits of the case, instead giving the administration and CASA \u2014 a group that sued the government over its policy \u2014 time to file briefs.",
      "\"We are pleased with the Fourth Circuit's decision to temporarily pause the termination of TPS for Afghanistan,\" CASA legal director Ama Frimpong said in a statement, adding the group will push for a longer-term pause. \"Although temporary, every moment counts when it comes to families figuring out their futures and being protected from ICE's terror.\"",
      "AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that has helped relocate Afghans, told CBS News the ruling \"offers a brief but critical window of relief.\"",
      "\"TPS has been a vital lifeline for tens of thousands of Afghans who supported U.S. missions or fled Taliban persecution. Ending it would not only uproot families and destabilize communities, it would betray a promise we made,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in an email. \"We are heartened by the court's stay, but this isn't a victory\u2014it's a pause. And it underscores the need for permanent protections, not political whiplash every few months.\"",
      "The White House criticized the ruling.",
      "\"Once again, a rogue judge is trying to infringe on the separation of powers and impede the Trump administration's rightful ability to carry out its immigration policy. Temporary Protective Status is meant to be 'temporary' in nature. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the ruling \"ignores the President's clear authorities under both Article II of the Constitution and the plain language of federal law.\"",
      "\"Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet it has been abused as one for decades,\" McLaughlin said. \"The Trump administration is restoring integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\"",
      "Some 11,700 Afghans are enrolled in temporary protected status, or TPS, according to federal estimates. The program was extended for Afghanistan in 2023, under the Biden administration, which cited a \"deepening humanitarian crisis\" and \"economic collapse\" in Afghanistan since the U.S. military's 2021 withdrawal led the Taliban to retake the country.",
      "The program is separate from the more permanent \"special immigrant visas\" issued to Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, often as translators. And migrants enrolled in TPS can apply for other forms of relief, including asylum.",
      "TPS for Afghanistan was set to expire in May of this year unless the Trump administration chose to extend it again. Two months ago, DHS announced it would end the program in mid-July, saying the administration was \"returning TPS to its original temporary intent.\"",
      "\"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent[s] them from returning to their home country,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
      "CASA sued Noem over the decision. The group argued the government had not followed the right procedure to end TPS, and alleged the decision wasn't motivated by whether Afghans still qualified for protection, but instead was \"part of the Trump Administration's broader effort to reduce the number of nonwhite immigrants in this country.\"",
      "The government pushed back on the lawsuit, writing that Noem has \"broad discretion\" over which countries qualify for TPS, and arguing the court shouldn't intervene because the protections are only meant to be temporary.",
      "Last week, a federal judge denied DHS's request to dismiss the lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed that ruling, and on Monday, an appellate court put the revocation of TPS on hold while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to wind down TPS for scores of other countries, impacting hundreds of thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, Cameroon and Afghanistan. The program had been expanded by former President Joe Biden, but President Trump has shifted to a more hardline stance on immigration.",
      "The TPS rollback has drawn some lawsuits, but in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants while the legal battles continue.",

    "summary": "Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, testified Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, testified Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, where he fielded questions about the administration's foreign policy and his plans for the role if he is confirmed.",
      "The hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was the first opportunity for lawmakers to publicly question him about his role in a Signal chat in which top administration officials\u00a0inadvertently disclosed sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen.",
      "In the weeks following the scandal, Democrats said they expected the hearing would be \"brutal\" for Waltz, but the Signal controversy did not come up until more than an hour into the hearing, which focused mostly on the administration's approach to China, Israel and the work of U.N. agencies around the world.",
      "The role of U.N. ambassador \u2014 the last of Mr. Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed \u2014 has been vacant for six months, leaving the U.S. without a top representative on a major world stage as several international crises play out. Waltz is likely to be confirmed, given Republican control of the Senate. Waltz would take the position as Mr. Trump's frustrations increase with Russia over its refusal to end its war in Ukraine and as the U.S. seeks to manage tensions with China and Iran.",
      "The hearing",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah introduced Waltz as \"one of the most well-qualified U.S. ambassador nominees to the United Nations ever,\" calling him a \"seasoned policy mind\" and \"skilled negotiator.\"",
      "\"With Waltz at the helm, the U.N. will have what I regard as what could and should be its last chance to demonstrate its actual value to the United States,\" Lee said.",
      "Republicans used the hearing to criticize the U.N., accusing it of being politicized and working against the U.S. and its allies, despite the U.S. being the largest donor. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered a general review of U.S. funding and involvement in the global body.",
      "\"You've got a heavy lift here,\" said Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho, the chairman of the committee.",
      "Waltz agreed that the U.N. needs \"major\" reform, but said there's \"good and meaningful work to be done.\"",
      "\"We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk, where China, Russia, Europe, the developing world, can come together and resolve conflicts,\" he said. \"But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking.\"",
      "But Democrats argued that a pullback would be at odds with U.S. interests because it would give China more influence.",
      "\"China is all too eager to take advantage of our disengagement at the U.N. and around the world. And while we may not all like what some U.N. institutions do, if we aren't at the table, we can't influence the agenda,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "Waltz responded that it was \"absolutely critical\" for the U.S. to be at the table to counter China's growing influence.",
      "Republicans also accused the U.N. of being a \"hotbed of antisemitism\" and asked Waltz if he would commit to vetoing \"one-sided anti-Israel resolutions.\"",
      "\"Yes, I'll make that commitment,\" Waltz said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware was the first to question Waltz about the Signal scandal, scolding him and the Trump administration for its handling of sensitive details about a military strike. But Waltz maintained that there was no classified information shared in the chat and defended the use of the app as \"not only authorized, it's still authorized and highly recommended.\"",
      "Waltz told Coons that no disciplinary action had been taken by the White House, while the Department of Defense is still conducting its investigation.",
      "\"There's been no consequences, and yet the president continues to denounce those who leak information,\" Coons said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called on Waltz to take accountability for the disclosure, telling him that he showed \"profound cowardice\" in how he handled the incident.",
      "\"I cannot support your nomination,\" Booker said. \"That's not leadership when you blame people that tell the truth. That's not leadership when you can't say the words, 'I made a mistake. I could have done better. I learned valuable lessons from this experience.' Instead, at a moment where our national security was clearly compromised, you denied, you deflected and then you demeaned and degraded those people who objectively told the truth and criticized your actions.\"",
      "The Signal chat",
      "Waltz was ousted as Mr. Trump's national security adviser in May, weeks after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he had unexpectedly been added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app by a user with Waltz's name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive details of an upcoming military operation in the chat, which included others like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "Administration officials acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that the operational details shared in the chat were classified. Waltz admitted that he created the chat, but denied knowing how Goldberg's contact information got into his phone.",
      "Sources previously told CBS News that Waltz's nomination for the ambassador role, a high-profile post in New York, was a last-minute decision by the president, and that the Signal controversy was one of the factors that led to his departure from the National Security Council.",
      "On Tuesday, Waltz denied being fired from the national security role and said he was kept on at the White House as an adviser.",
      "Mr. Trump named Waltz as his national security adviser, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, days after the Florida Republican was reelected to a fourth term in Congress. The pick cut into Republicans' narrow majority in the House and Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, pleaded with Mr. Trump not to poach any more members for administration roles.",
      "The slim majority stalled Mr. Trump's first choice for U.N. ambassador, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. When nominating Waltz, Mr. Trump said he had asked Stefanik to remain in Congress, where she could help advance his legislative agenda.",

    "summary": "As President Trump ramps up the pressure on dozens of countries, trade experts fear U.S. tariff policy leaves consumers and businesses in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine. The president said on Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days.",
      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",
      "So far, the White House has notched only a handful of trade deals, experts note, while agreements with major trading partners like the EU have been harder to come buy. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced a pact between the U.S. and Vietnam, while in June a more limited deal was reached with the United Kingdom that the White House said provides gives \"American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.\"",
      "Also last month, the U.S. and China announced that they\u00a0had agreed on a framework for a trade deal that makes it easier for U.S. businesses to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals.",
      "But with little time to thrash out trade agreements ahead of the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, some trade experts say the U.S. has made little progress since suspending country-based tariffs in April.",
      "\"We don't have any comprehensive deals with our largest trading partners,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank. \"Where this leaves us is where we've been \u2014 in a period of high uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\"",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said mixed messages from the Trump administration on trade is making it difficult to nail down agreements.",
      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool. His multiple goals conflict with one another.\"",
      "Demanding equal footing",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Mr. Trump's tariff agenda is driven in part by his desire for U.S. trade partners to lower both \"tariff and non-monetary trade barriers that are undermining American industries.\"",
      "Such moves by other nations would allow American industries to \"be on a more equal footing to compete and grow,\" Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's trade policies, tariffs have yet to significantly affect consumer prices in the U.S.",
      "Oxford's Daco said that the average U.S. tariff rate in June was around 15%, while the effective tariff rate -- or actual cost of tariffs on imports \u2014 was 10%. That's part of the reason, combined with a front-loading of imports by companies, why prices have been slow to rise.",
      "\"In terms of the full bite of tariffs, it's not yet visible in the duties collected,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

Michael Gordon, who also handled a series of U.S. Capitol riot prosecutions, was among several prosecutors fired in recent weeks, CBS News has learned. Gordon had recently taken over formal duties for prosecuting Govoni's case in Florida.",
      "Critics have accused the Trump administration of seeking political retribution for the U.S. Capitol insurrection cases by firing prosecutors, investigators and at least one administrator who worked on the cases. The Justice Department also fired investigators and prosecutors who helped former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation of President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified records and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "More than 20 total firings have been confirmed by CBS News. The Justice Department has not commented on the firings.",

      "Govoni is accused of being part of a scheme to embezzle money from an organization that was established to help manage money for people with special needs.

      "Amparo Perales, a mother whose son Javier has needed care for blindness and severe encephalitis, said her family lost $2 million in the scheme. Perales told CBS News she was \"shocked\" by Gordon's firing.",

      "Rebekah Bowman of Florida, whose son, Kienen Freeman, suffers from a severe seizure disorder, said she lost more than $1 million in funds for her son because of Govoni's alleged scheme.",
      "\"It took long enough to get him arrested. People have been through a lot and don't want any more delays,\" Bowman said.",
      "Govoni was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and multiple counts of fraud. He has not yet entered a plea, and an arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. Govoni's lawyers asked for him to be released pre-trial, noting he has \"no prior criminal history\" and describing him as a \"67-year-old in poor physical health.\" CBS News has reached out to his attorney for comment.",
      "An accountant for Govoni's company was also charged as part of the alleged conspiracy, and a not-guilty plea was entered in his case.",
      "Prosecutors said Govoni founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration in 2000 and helped manage approximately $200 million in funds and more than 2,000 special needs trusts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Govoni used the organization's accounts as a \"slush fund.\" Federal investigators said Govoni used the money to \"purchase real estate, travel via private jet, fund a brewery, make deposits into his personal bank accounts, and pay personal debts.\"",
      "In a series of letters filed with the federal court in Tampa last month, one parent of a person with special needs wrote, \"I wish you could look into the eyes of my son and the many other medically needy victims and tell them that you're going to do the right thing and keep that man behind bars where he belongs.\"",
      "Another parent wrote, \"Please do not let this horrible criminal out of jail. He is clever and surely has money hidden and plans to go into hiding if released. All his victims have breathed a sigh of relief when we heard he was finally arrested. The first relief any of us have felt since this has happened.\"",
      "Another victim wrote, \"Who steals from victimized children in foster care? The disabled? The most vulnerable amongst us? Someone who has no conscience, compassion, or mercy.\"",
      "Gordon is listed in court records as a Tampa-based prosecutor for the Justice Department. Like many federal prosecutors, he brought cases related to the Jan. 6 riots \u2014 which was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, with more than 1,500 defendants. Hours after Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he pardoned almost everybody convicted in the riot and ordered the Justice Department to drop charges against any remaining defendants.",
      "Gordon had a role in prosecuting one of the best-known Jan. 6 defendants, Ray Epps, who was at the center of conspiracy theories claiming \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 he was a government-planted agitator. Epps pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct on restricted grounds and was sentenced to probation.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Gordon's firing and its possible impact on Govoni's prosecution. Gordon did not offer a comment to CBS News.",

      "\"When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary's duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Two lower courts rose to the occasion, preliminarily enjoining the mass firings while the litigation remains ongoing. Rather than maintain the status quo, however, this Court now intervenes, lifting the injunction and permitting the Government to proceed with dismantling the Department. That decision is indefensible.\"",

      "Dismantling the Education Department",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping effort to slash the size of the federal government since returning to the White House earlier this year. His administration has sought to conduct mass layoffs across the executive branch, and in March, the president signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate her agency's closure \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\"",
      "As part of the plan to dismantle the Department of Education, the Trump administration canceled a slew of grants and implemented a reduction-in-force that impacted 1,378 employees \u2014 roughly one-third of the agency's workforce. Those who were laid-off were placed on administrative leave in March, with their government service set to end June 9.",
      "A group of 21 Democratic attorneys general, teachers unions and the Somerville and Easthampton school districts sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president and McMahon are unlawfully attempting to reorganize the Department of Education without authorization from Congress.",
      "Joun found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the Trump administration's actions were unlawful and said it is \"effectively disabling the department from carrying out its statutory duties by firing half of its staff, transferring key programs out of the department, and eliminating entire offices and programs.\"",
      "The judge said that the reduction-in-force implemented by McMahon would \"likely cripple the department,\" and blocked the secretary from carrying out the layoffs or transferring certain functions from the Education Department.",
      "In last month's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the layoffs at the Department of Education are part of the administration's \"policy of streamlining the department and eliminating discretionary functions that, in the administration's view, are better left to the states.\"",
      "He claimed that Joun's order \"thwarted the executive branch's authority to manage the Department of Education despite lacking jurisdiction to second-guess the executive's internal management decisions.\"",
      "But lawyers for the two Massachusetts-based school districts accused Education Department leaders of working to \"destroy the agency by executive fiat.\" They warned that if the Trump administration is allowed to move forward with its plans to dismantle the agency, the school districts may never be able to recover lost financial, informational and technical assistance.",
      "\"If the dismantling of the department is allowed to go forward now, and if respondents ultimately prevail at the end of this case, it will be effectively impossible to undo much of the damage caused,\" lawyers for the school districts argued in a filing. \"By contrast, if the government ultimately prevails in this case, it will be able to put its plans into operation merely slightly later than otherwise.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Democratic attorneys general said that the Trump administration has never drawn any connection between the layoffs at the Department of Education and its goal of increasing efficiency.",
      "\"If the administration disagrees with existing statutory law, it may propose legislation through which Congress might change its past policy judgments. And the secretary may exercise the department's lawful reorganization authority under\" federal law, they wrote in a filing. \"But the secretary cannot unilaterally redirect the nation's approach to education by starving the department of the staff necessary to do its work.\"",

      "Miami \u2014 Marine scientists in Miami are hoping to restore Florida's coral reef by taking coral from Honduras and crossbreeding\u00a0it.",
      "Warming ocean waters have had a devastating impact on the coral reefs of the Sunshine State. Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",
      "Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators.",
      "\"And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,\" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.",
      "With robust and healthy corals, South Florida's coastal communities are better protected from flooding because the reefs help break up hurricane-fueled waves. The planting of the first Flondurans is just the start of what's needed to rebuild.",

      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",

    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock being auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",

      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland.

      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy.

    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 21:10:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Nind Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",
      "\"After a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson telephoned into the meeting and \"looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible.\"",

      "Elmo's X account posted antisemitic and racist posts after it was hacked on Sunday, a spokesperson for the makers of \"Sesame Street\" said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Elmo's X account posted a statement\u00a0saying the account \"was briefly hacked by an outside party, in spite of the security measures in place.\"",
      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",
      "The posts on Elmo's X account were published several days after the team behind Grok, Elon Musk's xAI chatbot, deleted several posts on Musk's X in which the chatbot made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. The company later issued an apology.",
      "Musk and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, have been criticized for a surge of antisemitic and other hate speech on the site since he took ownership in October 2022. Musk allowed previously banned users back onto the platform \u2014 including\u00a0Andrew Tate,\u00a0Kanye West\u00a0and some notorious neo-Nazi figures \u2014 and reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League has also also been tracking a rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. The nonprofit\u00a0organization  said that last year, it recorded 9,354 antisemitic incidents nationwide, which is the highest number since it started monitoring more than four decades ago. That marked a 5% increase in incidents since 2023, and a 893% increase over the past decade.",

    "summary": "The latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development.",
    "story": [
      "Aaron J. Snoswell is a senior research fellow in AI Accountability at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embedded in X (formerly Twitter) and built by Elon Musk's company xAI, is back in the headlines after\u00a0calling itself \"MechaHitler\" and producing pro-Nazi remarks.",
      "The developers have\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the \"inappropriate posts\" and \"taken action to ban hate speech\" from Grok's posts on X. Debates about AI bias have been revived, too.",
      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAIMusk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAI",
      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",

      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms.

      "Musk introduced the new model in a livestream on X late Wednesday, calling Grok 4 \"the smartest AI in the world.\"",
      "\"It really is remarkable to see the advancement of artificial intelligence and how quickly it is evolving,\" Musk said, adding that \"AI is advancing vastly faster than any human.\"",

      "\"Grok 4 is smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines, simultaneously,\" Musk said. \"That's really something.\"",

      "Mr. Trump took the forces under federal control in early June, following protests against ICE action in Los Angeles.

He invoked a law known as Title 10, which says the president can call Guard troops into federal service to deal with a \"rebellion\" or if \"the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration, calling the deployment an \"unprecedented power grab\" and arguing it was illegal for Mr. Trump to federalize the Guard without his permission. A federal judge initially sided with Newsom, but an appellate court ultimately allowed Mr. Trump to keep the troops in Los Angeles while the legal battle played out, saying the president likely acted within his authority.",
      "During a visit to Los Angeles late last month, Vice President JD Vance called the Guard forces and Marines \"very much a necessary part of what's going on here,\" though he noted the situation in the city had \"gotten a lot better.\"",

      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",

      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",

But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",

      "A wildfire that tore through a historic Grand Canyon lodge\u00a0in Arizona and raged out of control Monday had been allowed to burn for days before erupting over the weekend, raising scrutiny over the National Park Service's decision not to aggressively attack the fire right away.",
      "The wildfire along the canyon's more isolated North Rim, where most visitors don't venture, was burning quickly with no containment, fire officials said. No injuries had been reported, but more than 70 structures were lost, including a visitors center and several cabins.",
      "At first, the fire didn't raise alarms after igniting from a lightning strike on July 4. Four days later, the Park Service said the fire was being allowed to burn to benefit the land and fire crews who were keeping close watch.",
      "\"There are no threats to infrastructure or public safety at this time,\" the park said on Facebook.",
      "Then three days later, on Friday, fire officials and the park service sent out warnings to \"evacuate immediately\" as the fire grew by nearly eight times within a day to more than 1.4 square miles.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs called for a federal investigation into the park service's handling of the fire.",
      "\"The federal government chose to manage that fire as a controlled burn during the driest, hottest part of the Arizona summer,\" the governor said in a social media post Sunday.",
      "She will be meeting with leadership in the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior soon to learn more about the decisions made in managing the wildfire, Hobbs' spokesperson Christian Slater said in an email.",
      "Authorities first used a \"confine and contain\" strategy but shifted to aggressive suppression as the fire \u2014 one of two that firefighters are dealing with on the North Rim \u2014 rapidly grew because of hot temperatures, low humidity and strong wind gusts, fire officials said.",
      "The Associated Press left phone and email messages Monday with a park service spokesperson seeking comment about how the fire was managed.",
      "The fire destroyed the Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging inside the park's North Rim, along with employee housing and a wastewater treatment plant, park Superintendent Ed Keable said Sunday.",
      "Park officials have closed access for the rest of the year to the North Rim, an area that draws only about 10% of the Grand Canyon's millions of annual visitors.",
      "Hikers in the area were evacuated and rafters on the Colorado River, which snakes through the canyon, were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, an outpost of cabins and dormitories. Trails to the area from the canyon's North and South rims also were closed.",
      "From the air, plumes of black smoke could be seen rising above the canyon walls and haze filled parts of the park. From the park's South Rim, visitors took pictures on Monday of the smoke blanketing the canyon in the distance.",
      "The fire flared up Saturday night, fueled by high winds. Firefighters managed to make progress, using aerial fire retardant drops near the lodge before they had to pull back because of a chlorine gas leak at the water treatment plant, the park service said.",
      "Hikers also were evacuated over concern that the poisonous, heavier-than-air gas could sink downhill, into the canyon.",
      "\"Arizona lost more than a historic lodge, it lost a piece of our state history,\" said Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego in a message\u00a0posted on social media.",
      "Gallego and fellow Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly sent a letter Monday to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum asking among other things how the administration planned to track wildfire decision-making under a recent executive order to consolidate federal firefighting forces into a single program.",
      "Across the West, about three dozen fires were burning uncontained and another 80 fires were being managed to clear out vegetation that has clogged the landscape, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.",
      "So far this year, nearly 2.5 million acres have burned. That's slightly below the 10-year average, the center said Monday.",
      "Along the Grand Canyon's North Rim, the Dragon Bravo Fire that destroyed the lodge and dozens of other buildings spread to nearly 9 square miles Monday with zero containment.",
      "The White Sage Fire also grew significantly and have charred 77 square miles of terrain with no containment. Officials reported progress in battling the fire.",
      "The fires came three years after two errant prescribed fires conducted by the U.S. Forest Service sparked the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, which burned more than 530 square miles of the Rocky Mountain foothills and destroyed hundreds of homes.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge, known for its huge ponderosa beams, massive limestone facade and a bronze statue of a donkey named \"Brighty the Burro,\" was perched on the edge of the North Rim and offered sweeping views of the canyon.",
      "\"It was like you're looking at this movie all the time,\" said Erik Ammerlann, who lived in Arizona for most of his adult life and stayed at the lodge nearly 10 years ago. \"You're really just one with nature.\"",
      "Aramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.",
      "An original lodge burned down from a kitchen fire in 1932, four years after construction was completed, according to the Grand Canyon Historical Society. The redesigned lodge using the original stonework opened in 1937.",

      "The Consumer Price Index in June rose 2.7% on an annual basis, a sign inflation around the U.S. is creeping up after declining earlier this year.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.7% last month, higher than last month's rate of 2.4%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. June's reading is the highest since February, when the CPI rose 2.8% on an annual basis.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.3%, which is the largest increase since January and in line with economists' forecasts.",

      "Food prices rose 3% on an annual basis last month, higher than the overall inflation rate. Items that have seen big cost increases since last June include eggs, which are up 27.3%, roasted coffee, which is up over 12.7%, and ground beef, which is up 10.3%.",
      "Meanwhile, energy was a large source of inflation, with energy prices rising 0.9% on a month-over-month basis. That follows a 1% drop in May.",
      "Other categories that increased in price since last month include household furnishings and operations, medical care, recreation, apparel and personal care, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.",
      "Early signs of tariff impact",
      "June's CPI reading indicates that tariffs might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories. Everyday items, from produce to apparel, could be susceptible to new levies if they are imported from abroad. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month predicted that tariffs could start to push up prices in the second half of the year.",
      "President Trump recently announced he would issue a flurry of new tariffs on over 20 countries, which he set will take effect on Aug. 1, extending the deadline of a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs that ended earlier this month.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge, said in a report that certain categories exposed to tariffs \u2014 ranging from apparel, home furnishings and appliances to footwear and toys \u2014 saw some upward pricing pressure. But other products vulnerable to higher levies, such as vehicles, remained stable.",
      "EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco estimates that roughly a third of the June rise in the CPI is attributable to higher tariffs.",
      "The muted CPI data from previous months indicates that companies have taken steps to offset the costs of tariffs, largely shielding consumers from price shocks. However, that could change.",
      "\"Strategies used by companies to avoid passing on cost increases to consumers are not eternal,\" Daco noted a report.",
      "July Fed cut unlikely",
      "Despite the June increase, Wall Street analysts say inflation mostly remains in check.",
      "\"While today's CPI release showed some early signs of tariff impact, on the whole underlying inflation remained muted,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Price pressures, however, are expected to strengthen over the summer and the July and August CPI reports will be important hurdles to clear.\"",
      "Analysts say the latest inflation data points to the Federal Reserve standing pat on interest rates at its meeting later this month. Investors see a more than 97% probability that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate in its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% when officials meet on July 29-30, according to The CME Group's FedWatch\u00a0tool.",
      "\"Today's inflation report all but dashes any remaining hopes that the Fed may cut interest rates at its meeting later this month,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email. \"However, if subsequent inflation readings reiterate the rise in inflation, it could jeopardize future rate cuts as well.\"",

      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",

The race ended with 13 miles going straight uphill.",

When you hit that finish line after that excitement and all that commotion of all the people around you cheering you on, your body says 'OK, time to get down that hill, get a shower, get in the hotel and get some sleep.'\"",
      "Becker was one of just 93 people to complete the Badwater 135 this year. It was his sixth time participating as a runner, though he's also worked on support teams for others in the race over the last 18 years.",
      "Three years ago at age 77, he'd hoped to break the previous record for the oldest runner to complete the race. His back gave out on him and while he did complete it, he didn't finish it within 48 hours, which is the official deadline. Becker finished 17 minutes after the cut off.",
      "He wasn't sure he'd give it another go, but after completing a 140-mile race in Arizona, Becker applied for the Badwater 135 again.",

      "Coach Lisa Smith-Batchen was part of Becker's four-person crew during this year's Badwater 135.",
      "\"My coach, Lisa, was my crew chief and then there were three other people on the crew. And when I had down moments or needed to eat and get calories in, and didn't want to, she gave me some tough love, kept me on track and kept me on toward the finish line,\" Becker said",
      "He was also joined by Marshall Ulrich, Heather Ulrich and Will Litwin. Crew members drive alongside runners, making sure to pass them water, food and electrolytes. Becker ate regularly throughout the race, mostly focused on ingesting liquid calories and gel. He also took two naps during the Badwater 135.",
      "Crew members have changes of shoes and clothing, and will help bandage blisters during the run. They also, one at a time, run alongside race participants to keep them company and help them stay motivated.",
      "\"These are people who know me \u2014 know my weaknesses, know my strengths,\" Becker said.",
      "Becker didn't get into running until he was in his late 50s. He celebrated his 60th birthday with his first ultramarathon: a 150-mile race in Morocco.",
      "In the years since, he's run all around the U.S. and the world, racing in China, Greece, Brazil, Canada and Costa Rica. His longest continuous run was 230 miles in Tennessee.",

      "When he's not training for a race, Becker typically runs 30-40 miles a week. He ramps it up to 60-70 miles when he's training. Becker also does some strength training and core work. While running, he'll sometimes drag an SUV tire attached to a belt.",
      "The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, resident lives in a pretty flat area, so he'll run up stairs to mimic hills during training, or spend 25 miles going back and forth across a steep bridge.",

      "When the team warden asked Bell if he had any final words, he responded, \"Thank you for not letting me spend the rest of my life in prison.\"",
      "Bell is the eighth person put to death in Florida this year, with a ninth scheduled for later this month. The state executed six people in 2023, but carried out only one execution last year.",
      "Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina have each executed four people. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have carried out one each.",
      "In December 1993, Bell spotted what he thought was the car of the man who fatally shot his brother earlier that year, according to court records. Bell was apparently unaware that the man had sold the car to West.",
      "Bell called on two friends and armed himself with an AK-47 rifle, authorities said. They found the car parked outside a liquor lounge and waited. When West, Smith and another woman eventually exited the club, Bell approached the car and opened fire, officials said.",
      "West died at the scene and Smith died on the way to the hospital. The other woman escaped injury. Witnesses said Bell also fired at a crowd of onlookers before fleeing the area. He was arrested the following year.",
      "Bell was later convicted of three additional murders. He fatally shot a woman and her toddler son in 1989 and he killed his mother's boyfriend about four months before the attack on West and Smith, officials said.",
      "Prison officials said Bell woke up at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday and ate his last meal, which was an omelet, bacon, home fries and orange juice. He met with a spiritual adviser but did not have any other visitors.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court denied Bell's request to stay the execution on Tuesday.",
      "His lawyers argued in their state filing that Bell's execution should be halted because of newly discovered evidence about witness testimony. But justices unanimously rejected the argument last week and pointed to overwhelming evidence of Bell's guilt in a 54-page opinion.",

    "story": [
      "Elmo's X account posted antisemitic and racist posts after it was hacked on Sunday, a spokesperson for the makers of \"Sesame Street\" said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Elmo's X account posted a statement\u00a0saying the account \"was briefly hacked by an outside party, in spite of the security measures in place.\"",
      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",
      "The posts on Elmo's X account were published several days after the team behind Grok, Elon Musk's xAI chatbot, deleted several posts on Musk's X in which the chatbot made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. The company later issued an apology.",
      "Musk and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, have been criticized for a surge of antisemitic and other hate speech on the site since he took ownership in October 2022. Musk allowed previously banned users back onto the platform \u2014 including\u00a0Andrew Tate,\u00a0Kanye West\u00a0and some notorious neo-Nazi figures \u2014 and reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League has also also been tracking a rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. The nonprofit\u00a0organization  said that last year, it recorded 9,354 antisemitic incidents nationwide, which is the highest number since it started monitoring more than four decades ago. That marked a 5% increase in incidents since 2023, and a 893% increase over the past decade.",

      "If convicted on the stalking or shooting charges, Boelter could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. If convicted on the murder charges, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.",
      "Joseph H. Thompson, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, who led Tuesday's news conference, says the indictment includes a \"notice of special findings,\" which he says is the first step in seeking the death penalty.",
      "\"The ultimate decision on whether to seek the death penalty will not come for several months,\" Thompson said. \"And will ultimately be decided by Attorney General (Pam) Bondi with input from the Capitol Case Unit in the Department of Justice, along with this office and the victims.\"",
      "U.S. attorney shares details on Boelter's letter to FBI Director Kash Patel",
      "While updating on the indictment, Thompson also shared details of a letter that his office says was written by Boelter with the hope that it would be delivered to FBI Director Kash Patel. In the letter, Boelter claimed to have been trained \"off the books\" by the U.S. military, and claimed he had performed missions for them overseas.",
      "According to court documents, the letter had been written after the shootings of the Hortmans and Hoffmans.",
      "Thompson added that Boelter also, in the letter, made claims that Gov. Tim Walz approached him and wanted him to kill Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Boelter allegedly claimed, in the letter, that he wanted to go public with that claim but that \"people\" threatened to kill his family if he didn't do it.",
      "In the letter, he allegedly tried to communicate to Patel, \"If you want me to turn myself in it need (sic) to be directly to you and then I need to be held at a military prison or on in asia (sic) or the middle East, or at least on a military ship over there.\"",
      "Thompson suggested it would be speculation to declare whether the contents of Boelter's note were \"a delusion\" or whether they were an attempt to \"misdirect our investigation or, frankly, to excuse his crimes.\"",
      "\"You should notice how I didn't fire one round at any police officers and boy did I have plenty of opportunity,\" Boelter wrote in the letter, court documents say.",
      "Thompson previously said the federal case will precede Hennepin County's case because of the serious issues involved.",
      "\"Vance Boelter committed a terrible act of political violence and extremism \u2014 a targeted political assassination that was unprecedented in the state of Minnesota,\" Thompson said Tuesday. \"It's been a terrible, personal tragedy for the Hoffman and Hortman families and something that has rocked the entire state of Minnesota and even the country.\"",
      "Boelter also faces state charges, and could face life without parole if convicted on those.",
      "Hope Hoffman released a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying, in part, \"I feel relief today in knowing that the perpetrator of these heinous acts will be charged to the fullest extent of the law. Though I was not shot physically, I will now forever coexist with the PTSD of watching my parents be nearly shot dead in front of me and seeing my life flash before my eyes with a gun in my face.\"",
      "Authorities say Boelter impersonated a police officer and shot the lawmakers and their spouses at their respective Twin Cities homes on June 14. He was arrested at his Sibley County home after a 36-hour manhunt that officials said was the largest in state history.",
      "Earlier this month, Boelter made a court appearance where he waived his right to a probable cause hearing and a detention hearing he had scheduled. He told the judge he was \"looking forward to the truth about the 14th [getting] to the public.\"",
      "In a previous court appearance, Boelter told the court he hadn't slept in about two weeks and complained of poor conditions at the Sherburne County Jail in Elk River, Minnesota. The Sherburne County sheriff disputed those claims.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-judge-reverses-medical-debt-rule-credit-reports-cfpb/",
    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:41:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% if Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on govrernment protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Margetta Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Margetta Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as to check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-trump-news-economy-uncertainty/",
    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 07:25:56 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump ramps up the pressure on dozens of countries, trade experts fear U.S. tariff policy leaves consumers and businesses in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine. The president said on Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days.",
      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",
      "So far, the White House has notched only a handful of trade deals, experts note, while agreements with major trading partners like the EU have been harder to come buy. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced a pact between the U.S. and Vietnam, while in June a more limited deal was reached with the United Kingdom that the White House said provides gives \"American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.\"",
      "Also last month, the U.S. and China announced that they\u00a0had agreed on a framework for a trade deal that makes it easier for U.S. businesses to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals.",
      "But with little time to thrash out trade agreements ahead of the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, some trade experts say the U.S. has made little progress since suspending country-based tariffs in April.",
      "\"We don't have any comprehensive deals with our largest trading partners,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank. \"Where this leaves us is where we've been \u2014 in a period of high uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\"",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said mixed messages from the Trump administration on trade is making it difficult to nail down agreements.",
      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool. His multiple goals conflict with one another.\"",
      "Demanding equal footing",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Mr. Trump's tariff agenda is driven in part by his desire for U.S. trade partners to lower both \"tariff and non-monetary trade barriers that are undermining American industries.\"",
      "Such moves by other nations would allow American industries to \"be on a more equal footing to compete and grow,\" Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's trade policies, tariffs have yet to significantly affect consumer prices in the U.S.",
      "Oxford's Daco said that the average U.S. tariff rate in June was around 15%, while the effective tariff rate -- or actual cost of tariffs on imports \u2014 was 10%. That's part of the reason, combined with a front-loading of imports by companies, why prices have been slow to rise.",
      "\"In terms of the full bite of tariffs, it's not yet visible in the duties collected,\" he said.",
      "Following are the tariff rates the U.S. said last week it would impose on roughly two dozen countries as well as members of the EU:",

      "The possible violation of the celibacy rule for monks has rocked Buddhist institutions and gripped public attention in Thailand in recent weeks. At least nine abbots and senior monks involved in the scandal have been disrobed and cast out of the monkhood, the Royal Thai Police Central Investigation Bureau said.",
      "Wilawan Emsawat, in her mid-30s, was arrested at her home in Nonthaburi province north of the capital Bangkok on charges including extortion, money laundering and receiving stolen goods. Police said they traced money transferred to her by a senior monk from a bank account belonging to his temple in northern Thailand.",
      "Wilawan has not made a statement since her arrest and it was unclear if she has legal representation. Speaking to local media before her arrest, she acknowledged one relationship and said she had given money to that monk.",
      "Scandals involving monks surface a few times a year in Thailand but usually don't involve senior members of the clergy. The case also puts a spotlight on the large sums of money donated to temples controlled by abbots, which is in marked contrast to the abstemious lives they are supposed to lead under their religion's precepts.",
      "Wilawan deliberately targeted senior monks for financial gain, police said, noting they found several monks had transferred large amounts of money after Wilawan initiated romantic relationships with them.",
      "Wilawan's bank accounts received around 385 million baht ($11.9 million) in the past three years, but most of the funds were spent on online gambling websites, police said.\u00a0 The biggest bets were 500,000 baht each, the Bangkok Post reported, citing police.",
      "Jaroonkiat Pankaew, a Central Investigation Bureau deputy commissioner, said the investigation began last month after an abbot of a famous temple in Bangkok abruptly left the monkhood.",
      "Investigators found the abbot had allegedly been blackmailed by Wilawan over their romantic relationship. She told the monk that she was pregnant and asked him to pay $222,000 in financial assistance, Jaroonkiat said at a news conference in Bangkok Tuesday.",
      "Police believed \"this woman is dangerous and we needed to arrest her as soon as possible,\" Jaroonkiat said.",
      "Thai media reported a search of her mobile phones revealed tens of thousands of photos and videos, as well as numerous chat logs indicating intimacy with several monks, many of which could be used for blackmail.",

      "Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai ordered authorities to review and consider tightening existing laws related to monks and temples, especially the transparency of temple finances, to restore faith in Buddhism, government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said Tuesday.",
      "The Central Investigation Bureau has set up a Facebook page for people to report monks who misbehave, Jaroonkiat said.",

    "story": [
      "A volcanic eruption in southwestern Iceland has once again forced the evacuation of tourists at the internationally known Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, the national broadcaster RUV reported. The eruption began around 4 a.m. following an intense seismic swarm on the Reykjanes Peninsula, southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, Iceland's Met Office said.",
      "A campsite in the town of Grindavik was evacuated shortly after the seismic activity began. Guests at the Blue Lagoon were forced to quickly pack their bags, RUV reported.",
      "Lava from the eruption is flowing southeast from a fissure in the barren landscape that is about 2,300 to 3,300 feet wide, but the molten rock isn't threatening any infrastructure, the Met Office said.",
      "Grindavik has been repeatedly affected by the activity since November 2023 when a volcano in the area came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years. There were at least\u00a0seven disruptive volcanic eruptions\u00a0during 2024. But authorities said Wednesday that the town was not in danger.",
      "An eruption in early April also forced tourists to leave Blue Lagoon, and flames and smoke shooting into the air from the open fissure near Grindavik also prompted the evacuation of about 40 homes.",
      "Iceland sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic and is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country. It is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",
      "The most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010\u00a0eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted transatlantic air travel for months.",

    "story": [
      "Russia has rejected President Trump's \"ultimatum\" for Moscow to sign a ceasefire deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days on Tuesday as \"unacceptable,\" calling for continued negotiations and insisting that the invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin would continue until its goals are achieved.",
      "In response to President Trump's threat to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries that do business with Russia if Putin's government does not agree to a deal to end the war in that timeframe, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Tuesday that \"any attempts to make demands, especially ultimatums, are unacceptable to us,\" according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.",
      "\"We need to focus on political and diplomatic work. The President of the Russian Federation has repeatedly said that we are ready to negotiate and the diplomatic path is preferable for us,\" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. \"If we cannot achieve our goals through diplomacy, then the SVO (war in Ukraine) will continue\u2026 This is an unshakable position. We would like Washington and NATO as a whole to take it with the utmost seriousness.\"",

      "\"Some of it is addressed personally to (Russian) President Putin. We definitely need time to analyze what was said in Washington,\" Peskov said during his daily briefing on Tuesday. \"If and when President Putin deems it necessary, he will definitely comment on it. I would not want to get ahead of ourselves, so let's wait for Putin's decision on whether he will comment on it himself.\"",
      "Russia's former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is close to the Kremlin, called Mr. Trump's remarks \"a theatrical ultimatum\" in a post on social media, adding that \"Russia didn't care.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \"at the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, too bad.\" Mr. Trump said at that point, \"the tariffs are going to go, and other sanctions\" but he added that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"shouldn't target\" Moscow.",
      "Speaking Monday in the Oval Office alongside visiting NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Mr. Trump said: \"We are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.\" He also announced a deal for the U.S. to sell additional weapons to its NATO allies, with the understanding that they will then send the weapons to Ukraine.",

      "\"I always hang up, say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call.' And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city and I say, 'That's strange.'\" Mr. Trump said. \"After that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "When asked in an interview with CBS News partner BBC News  if he was done trying to deal with the Russian leader, Mr. Trump said: \"I'm disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him. But I'm disappointed in him.\"",
      "In a social media post on Monday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Mr. Trump and thanked his American counterpart, \"for the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\"",
      "\"It's important that we have such a good relationship, and that the Alliance countries are working to increase defense spending,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he and Mr. Trump had made plans to speak again.",

      "Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. The attack, involving tens of thousands of uniformed soldiers and barrages of missiles, came after Russia unilaterally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula after backing separatist forces in the region.",

    "summary": "The mosaic shows a pair of lovers who are partially undressed. The tile may have been in a bedroom floor, Pompeii officials said.",
    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

      "Federal authorities on Tuesday released new images of three Iranian intelligence officers allegedly involved in the abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson.",
      "Each attached to a seeking information poster, the images of Reza Amiri Moghadam, Taghi Daneshvar and Gholamhossein Mohammadnia are part of an extensive investigation into Levinson's disappearance in 2007, the FBI's Washington field office said.",
      "Moghadam is the current Iranian ambassador to Pakistan and previously led the operations unit of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security in Tehran, an agency whose members the FBI has accused of helping orchestrate Levinson's abduction.",
      "Daneshvar is described by the FBI as a high-ranking officer in the Iranian intelligence ministry involved in counterespionage activities. Around the time Levinson disappeared, he allegedly oversaw the work of\u00a0Mohammad Baseri, another Iranian intelligence officer whom the United States government has accused in the abduction.",
      "Mohammadnia is a senior deputy in the intelligence ministry who served as the Iranian ambassador to Albania in 2016, before being expelled from Albania two years later for \"damaging its national security,\" according to the FBI. The U.S. agency said Mohammadnia led an initiative to blame Levinson's disappearance \"on a terrorist group in Pakistan's Baluchistan region to shift blame away from the Iranian government.\"",
      "\"These three intelligence officers were among those who allegedly facilitated Bob's 2007 abduction and the subsequent cover-up by the Iranian government. Bob likely later perished in captivity far away from his family, friends, and colleagues,\" said Steven Jenson, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington office, in a statement. \"The FBI will continue its relentless pursuit to hold anyone involved in his abduction to account for their reprehensible actions.\"",
      "The U.S. has maintained a view since Levinson vanished that the retired agent was kidnapped during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran, and subsequently detained wrongfully by the Iranian government. Levinson was believed to be alive for years, until U.S. officials in 2020 said intelligence indicated he may actually have been dead \"for some time.\"",
      "Moghadam, Daneshvar and Mohammadnia were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in March for allegedly playing a role in Levinson's \"abduction, probable death, and Iran's efforts to cover up or obfuscate their responsibility,\" the federal agency said in an announcement at the time.",
      "The latest seeking information posters followed two others released by the FBI in December, for Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, both Iranian senior intelligence officers thought to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, detention and probable death.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, testified Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, where he fielded questions about the administration's foreign policy and his plans for the role if he is confirmed.",
      "The hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was the first opportunity for lawmakers to publicly question him about his role in a Signal chat in which top administration officials\u00a0inadvertently disclosed sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen.",
      "In the weeks following the scandal, Democrats said they expected the hearing would be \"brutal\" for Waltz, but the Signal controversy did not come up until more than an hour into the hearing, which focused mostly on the administration's approach to China, Israel and the work of U.N. agencies around the world.",
      "The role of U.N. ambassador \u2014 the last of Mr. Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed \u2014 has been vacant for six months, leaving the U.S. without a top representative on a major world stage as several international crises play out. Waltz is likely to be confirmed, given Republican control of the Senate. Waltz would take the position as Mr. Trump's frustrations increase with Russia over its refusal to end its war in Ukraine and as the U.S. seeks to manage tensions with China and Iran.",
      "The hearing",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah introduced Waltz as \"one of the most well-qualified U.S. ambassador nominees to the United Nations ever,\" calling him a \"seasoned policy mind\" and \"skilled negotiator.\"",
      "\"With Waltz at the helm, the U.N. will have what I regard as what could and should be its last chance to demonstrate its actual value to the United States,\" Lee said.",
      "Republicans used the hearing to criticize the U.N., accusing it of being politicized and working against the U.S. and its allies, despite the U.S. being the largest donor. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered a general review of U.S. funding and involvement in the global body.",
      "\"You've got a heavy lift here,\" said Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho, the chairman of the committee.",
      "Waltz agreed that the U.N. needs \"major\" reform, but said there's \"good and meaningful work to be done.\"",
      "\"We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk, where China, Russia, Europe, the developing world, can come together and resolve conflicts,\" he said. \"But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking.\"",
      "But Democrats argued that a pullback would be at odds with U.S. interests because it would give China more influence.",
      "\"China is all too eager to take advantage of our disengagement at the U.N. and around the world. And while we may not all like what some U.N. institutions do, if we aren't at the table, we can't influence the agenda,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "Waltz responded that it was \"absolutely critical\" for the U.S. to be at the table to counter China's growing influence.",
      "Republicans also accused the U.N. of being a \"hotbed of antisemitism\" and asked Waltz if he would commit to vetoing \"one-sided anti-Israel resolutions.\"",
      "\"Yes, I'll make that commitment,\" Waltz said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware was the first to question Waltz about the Signal scandal, scolding him and the Trump administration for its handling of sensitive details about a military strike. But Waltz maintained that there was no classified information shared in the chat and defended the use of the app as \"not only authorized, it's still authorized and highly recommended.\"",
      "Waltz told Coons that no disciplinary action had been taken by the White House, while the Department of Defense is still conducting its investigation.",
      "\"There's been no consequences, and yet the president continues to denounce those who leak information,\" Coons said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called on Waltz to take accountability for the disclosure, telling him that he showed \"profound cowardice\" in how he handled the incident.",
      "\"I cannot support your nomination,\" Booker said. \"That's not leadership when you blame people that tell the truth. That's not leadership when you can't say the words, 'I made a mistake. I could have done better. I learned valuable lessons from this experience.' Instead, at a moment where our national security was clearly compromised, you denied, you deflected and then you demeaned and degraded those people who objectively told the truth and criticized your actions.\"",
      "The Signal chat",
      "Waltz was ousted as Mr. Trump's national security adviser in May, weeks after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he had unexpectedly been added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app by a user with Waltz's name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive details of an upcoming military operation in the chat, which included others like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "Administration officials acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that the operational details shared in the chat were classified. Waltz admitted that he created the chat, but denied knowing how Goldberg's contact information got into his phone.",
      "Sources previously told CBS News that Waltz's nomination for the ambassador role, a high-profile post in New York, was a last-minute decision by the president, and that the Signal controversy was one of the factors that led to his departure from the National Security Council.",
      "On Tuesday, Waltz denied being fired from the national security role and said he was kept on at the White House as an adviser.",
      "Mr. Trump named Waltz as his national security adviser, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, days after the Florida Republican was reelected to a fourth term in Congress.

    "summary": "The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki was discovered more than 2,600 feet below the ocean's surface near the Solomon Islands.",
    "story": [
      "A famed Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes during a pivotal battle in World War II has been discovered on the floor of the Pacific Ocean more than 80 years after it sank, an exploration team has revealed. The warship was found still armed with unused depth charges, according to the explorers.",
      "The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki was located by a remotely operated vehicle more than 2,600 feet below the ocean's surface near the Solomon Islands, the Ocean Exploration Trust announced on Saturday.",
      "\"Lying on the seabed at over 800 meters in the Solomon Islands, this is the first time anyone has laid eyes on Teruzuki since it was sunk in WWII's naval battles off Guadalcanal,\" said the trust, which released images and video of the wreck.",
      "Teruzuki (which translates to \"Shiny Moon\" in Japanese) was under the command of Rear Admiral Raizou Tanaka. The legendary naval leader earned the moniker \"Tenacious Tanaka\" among U.S. forces for leading dangerous attacks and so-called \"Tokyo Express\" supply missions during the middle of the night.",
      "Weeks before descending to its watery grave, the Teruzuki used its state-of-the-art weaponry to great effect. In November 1942, the 400-foot-long Akizuki-class destroyer used its rapid-fire 100mm guns to help sink two U.S. destroyers,\u00a0according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The Teruzuki's torpedoes also severely damaged two other U.S. battleships.",
      "But on Dec. 12, 1942, the Teruzuki was targeted by American PT boats as it tried to protect a convoy of supply ships on Guadalcanal's northern coast, according to historians. The Teruzuki was hit by two U.S. torpedoes, breaking its rudder and disabling the ship. Most of the crew were rescued or swam ashore, but nine men died as the Teruzuki plunged to the bottom of the ocean.",
      "A remotely operated camera launched by the Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus brought the first glimpse of the ship since that day when it spotted the wreck on July 10, the trust said. The massive warship had been severed, with its stern and hull 650 feet apart on the seafloor \u2014 but its munitions were still intact.",
      "An eerie video released by the trust shows the stern armed with multiple depth charges. One scientist can be heard on the video saying that an expert warned the team to be \"extra careful as some Japanese ordnance at this time of the war had a reputation for being really sensitive.\"",
      "The team also noted that the ship was found with its forward artillery turrets pointing skyward.",
      "\"When the exploration team found a 19-meter-long severed segment of Teruzuki's stern littered with depth charges, it disproved a long-held theory that it was depth charge explosions that sealed the ship's fate,\" the trust said in a separate news release.",
      "Ship located in Iron Bottom Sound",
      "Iron Bottom Sound in the Solomon Islands was the site of five pivotal naval battles between August and December 1942.",
      "Located about 600 northeast of Australia, the Solomon Islands became coveted territory for both Japan and the Allied Forces during World War II. The tiny island of Guadalcanal was key because of its airfield and its location, which offered command over shipping lanes in the region.",
      "\"Recognizing this island and airfield's strategic value, both sides would soon commit substantial naval and air resources to control the island, the airfield, and its surrounding waters,\" the Ocean Exploration Trust  said.",
      "Dozens of warships were sunk in Iron Bottom Sound, and the Teruzuki is just the latest to be discovered. Earlier this month, the same researchers found the severed bow of the American warship USS New Orleans during seafloor mapping operations in the area.",
      "In addition to the Teruzuki, at least six Japanese warships were lost off Guadalcanal between August and December 1942, according to the trust, and at least 10 Allies ships were lost during the same period.",
      "One of the American vessels lost in the area was the USS Laffey, a Benson-class destroyer that survived a major battle in October 1942 but was sunk in Guadalcanal on Nov. 12, 1942. One of the ships that sank USS Laffey was in fact the Teruzuki, which had only seen combat for a few months until its demise.",
      "The designs and details of Japanese naval ships were cloaked in secrecy during World War II. There are no historical images of the\u00a0  Teruzuki, making the new discovery especially revealing, the trust said.",
      "\"I feel so lucky to see this ship. The fact that we have not seen Teruzuki in over 80 years underscores the importance of recording maritime heritage now,\" said Hiroshi Ishii, a Nautilus science team member and researcher at Kyoto University. \"As a Japanese person, I appreciate the opportunity to witness part of our history and to be part of an international team shedding light on this campaign, which is important to all of our nations' history.\"",
      "In 2023, the wreckage of a Japanese ship that was torpedoed during World War II off the coast of the Philippines was found. The ship was carrying Allied prisoners of war, most of them Australians, when it sank in 1942. All 1,080 people aboard perished.",

The stone wall was constructed by Britain's Roman occupiers almost 2,000 years ago as a defensive structure, and the portion of the wall where the tree stood featured in a scene of the 1991 Hollywood blockbuster \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,\" with Kevin Costner, bringing the bucolic spot and the grand tree some degree of international fame.",
      "A jury at the same court had convicted the former friends on two counts each of criminal damage for their 2023 nighttime felling of the tree, for damaging both the sycamore maple tree and the Roman wall. They had faced a possible maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.",
      "Reacting to the guilty verdict in May, the National Trust conservation organization said the \"needless felling\" of the tree had \"shocked people around the country and overseas.\"",
      "\"It was felt particularly deeply here in the northeast of England where the tree was an emblem of the region and the backdrop to many personal memories,\" said a spokesperson.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright told the court that the pair drove to the site, near the town of Hexham, in Graham's Range Rover and felled the tree on the night of September 27, 2023, slicing through the trunk with a chainsaw in \"a matter of minutes.\"",

      "\"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House, laying out a new ultimatum and deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire to end its war in Ukraine.",
      "The levies, he said, would be applied as \"secondary tariffs\" \u2014 not targeting Russia directly, but designed to increase Moscow's economic pain by pressuring its trade partners to stop buying or selling products in the energy, agriculture and weapons sectors with Russia.",
      "China and India became the world's first and second biggest importers of Russian oil in 2023 after Western sanctions were imposed against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The top post had previously been held by the 27-nation European Union.",

      "After launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin renegotiated prices with its trade partners, offering steep discounts on Russian oil compared to U.S. and European crude. NATO member Turkey is another major importer of Russian oil and natural gas.",
      "In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates \u2014   while not a major energy importer itself \u2014   serves as a financial hub for the international trade in Russian oil. Dubai is also a safe haven for Russian capital and oligarchs.",

      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland.

      "He voiced similar sentiments to CBS News partner network BBC News Tuesday, saying of Putin, \"We'll have a great conversation. I'll say: 'That's good, I'll think we're close to getting it done,' and then he'll knock down a building in Kyiv.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he'd thought a deal was close with Russia four different times.",
      "The BBC reports that, when asked if he was \"done with\" Putin, Mr. Trump replied: \"I'm disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him. But I'm disappointed in him.\"",
      "Zelenskyy posted on X Monday afternoon that he spoke with Mr. Trump, and thanked him and the U.S. for the \"willingness to support Ukraine.\"",
      "\"We discussed the necessary means and solutions with the president to provide better protection for people from Russian attacks and to strengthen our positions,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"We are ready to work as productively as possible to achieve peace.\"",
      "Some in Congress have pushed for even higher secondary sanctions on Russia as the war grinds on. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal are pushing legislation in the Senate that would give the president the ability to impose tariffs of up to 500% on any country that does business with Russia. Graham told\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that these sanctions would give Mr. Trump a \"sledgehammer\" to end the war.",
      "In a joint statement Monday, Graham and Blumenthal said the president's announcement was \"a real executive hammer to drive the parties to the negotiating table.\"",
      "\"The goal is not more tariffs and sanctions \u2014 the goal is to entice Putin to come to the peace table,\" they said.",
      "The senators said they will continue their legislative work to implement up to 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Graham also told \"Face the Nation\" that the U.S. has \"given Ukraine a lot. We give them the money, we give them military aid.\" But he noted that there could be a \"plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-imposes-tariff-fresh-mexican-tomatoes/",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

      "Prosecutors had initially\u00a0sought a record $250 million\u00a0in criminal asset seizures. But the court ruled that they had used too broad a legal basis and reduced the amount, applying stricter criteria and excluding several unproven claims.",
      "Prosecutors said last month that Leijdekkers had made 114 million euros from 14 cocaine shipments over less than a year.",
      "According to intercepted communications, the 34-year-old also spent 47 million euros on 975 kilograms of gold over less than six months.",

      "Images apparently showing Leijdekkers in the company of officials as high as President Julius Maada Bio have sparked speculation that the cocaine baron has cosied up to Sierra Leone's political class \u2014 including the president's daughter.",
      "Suspicions that he was in Sierra Leone arose after the country's first lady, Fatima Bio, posted pictures and a video on social media that showed a man strongly resembling Leijdekkers at a religious service, also attended by President Bio.",
      "Exiled Sierra Leone opposition figure Mohamed Mansaray has accused Bio and his government of \"offering refuge\" to the drug lord.",
      "According to Mansaray, Leijdekkers has coupled up with the president's daughter, Agnes Bio, who is seen accompanying the drug lord in the images.",
      "Leijdekkers is also believed to be involved in the disappearance and death of Naima Jillal, a woman who went missing in 2019 after she got into a car in Amsterdam,\u00a0according to Europol. Intercepted messages allegedly showed that Leijdekkers \"played an important role in Jillal's disappearance,\" the agency said.",

      "Littrell wrote in the lawsuit that he has been forced to hire security to protect his land and family, and filled out a Walton County Trespass Authorization Form, authorizing the sheriff\u2019s department to warn and prosecute trespassers on his property.",

      "The lawsuit says that on May 4, a sheriff\u2019s deputy spoke to an alleged trespasser on Littrell\u2019s property, but didn\u2019t remove the trespasser or cite them, merely saying that the alleged trespasser \"'doesn\u2019t agree with private beaches,\u2019 going on to characterize BLB\u2019s insistence that it\u2019s constitutional rights be upheld as \u2018lunacy,\u2019 to use one of the words used by a deputy of the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\"",
      "The lawsuit also claims that on June 5, an alleged trespasser grabbed legal documents related to the dispute out of the property manager\u2019s hand \"and scattered the papers into the wind across the beach.\"",
      "Littrel said BLB also contacted the sheriff\u2019s department twice that day regarding the \"aggressor,\" but the department \"refused to send any officer.\"",
      "\"When BLB personnel contacted the Sheriff for the third time to request an officer again, the 911 operator simply hung up on BLB personnel rather than dispatching the officer that was requested more than an hour prior,\" the lawsuit states.",

It gradually became emotion over evidence, and that is antithetical to jurisprudential standards in America.\"",
      "\"The court of public opinion is an angry mob; a court of law is a jury of your peers.

      "Others may get absorbed in an activity (a symptom known as hyperfocus), losing track of time completely, the expert noted.",

      "Time blindness is most commonly linked to ADHD, but it can also arise with other neurological conditions. (iStock)",
      "Time blindness is not listed in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is the accepted reference book for mental health and brain-related conditions, Singer noted.",
      "While there is no formal diagnosis for the condition, the inability to perceive and manage time is included in the DSM-5 criterion for ADHD.",

      "Treating time blindness often involves a multi-layered approach, starting with minimizing delays, according to Sivanathan.",

      "What if the answer to cleaner energy was right out on the waves? A new green energy system is set to change how we capture clean power, and it all starts with the ocean. French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out.

      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "What you need to know about AI phishing attacks",
      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",
      "Wikipedia page showing ChatGPT description on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web. As a result, AI tools are more prone to guessing or fabricating links when asked about them, raising the risk of exposing users to unsafe destinations.",

      "AI chatbots often sound confident even when they are wrong. If a chatbot tells you where to log in, do not click the link right away. Instead, go directly to the website by typing its URL manually or using a trusted bookmark.",
      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",

      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Smart thermostats and utility control: What to know",
      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "AI tattoo machine (Blackdot)",
      "What is the Blackdot AI tattoo machine and how does it work?",
      "Blackdot is not just a new tool. It's a complete reimagining of how tattoos are created. This device doesn't look like a traditional tattoo machine. It's a sleek, robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. It uses computer vision, lasers and a microscope to apply ink with surgical precision. The dots it places are about the size of a human hair. Blackdot is currently in studios like Bang Bang in New York City. It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. (Blackdot)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Every day, millions of people install tiny browser add-ons they believe will improve productivity or entertainment. With so many options available on the Chrome Web Store, users often rely on trust markers like install counts, user reviews and developer reputation to make their choice. Many glance at shiny verification badges and five-star ratings, assume the vetting process was solid, and click \"Install\" without thinking twice.",
      "But attackers have started to exploit these very signals. Researchers recently uncovered a campaign where 18 browser extensions, all listed on the official Chrome and Edge Web Stores, tracked users\u2019 online activity. These extensions had already racked up more than 2 million installs.",

      "A person using Google on a laptop.\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How hackers are hiding malware in popular Chrome extensions",
      "Koi Security researchers discovered that attackers used long-term, strategic tactics to weaponize browser extensions. First, they released functional and legitimate utilities to gain user trust. Over time, these extensions collected positive reviews and built a solid reputation. Then, after months or even years of quiet operation, the attackers pushed a silent update that injected malicious scripts into the trusted codebase.",
      "Since these updates came directly from official sources, they easily bypassed corporate firewalls. Unlike phishing emails or shady downloads, the malicious code arrived through routine, automatic updates and raised no immediate red flags.",
      "How malicious Chrome extensions evade detection and spread",
      "As the investigation progressed, researchers traced suspicious traffic back to a seemingly harmless color picker extension. This led them to a cluster of connected domains, each acting as a command and control hub. These servers recorded every URL users visited and issued commands to force redirects to fake websites or ad-heavy landing pages.",
      "Next, the team analyzed the extension\u2019s code more closely and uncovered matching fingerprints in several unrelated tools. These included weather widgets, emoji keyboards, video speed controllers and volume boosters. Although they appeared different on the surface, they shared underlying code and behavior.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Together, these extensions reached over two million installations. To avoid detection, the attackers used separate branding and categories for each one, making it difficult for marketplace monitors to spot patterns.

      "3) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even though these malicious extensions come from official stores and update automatically, strong antivirus software can help detect suspicious activities such as hidden trackers, injected scripts or unauthorized redirects.

      "5) Watch for security alerts:\u00a0Keep an eye on your email and texts for login warnings or access alerts from services you use. These can help you spot unauthorized activity early.",
      "6) Use a browser with extension permission controls: Some browsers let you limit what data extensions can access (e.g., \"only on click\" or \"only on specific sites\"). This can reduce the risk of future attacks.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Browser extensions can be helpful, but they also carry hidden risks. As this case shows, even trusted tools from official stores can turn malicious without warning. That is why it pays to stay alert, review your extensions regularly, and use strong antivirus protection. A few simple habits can go a long way in keeping your browser and your personal data safe.",

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower. This technology allows robots to scan containers and generate accurate 3D models of the objects inside by analyzing how signals bounce back from hidden surfaces.",

      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We may be entering an era where robots don't just move boxes, but they understand what's in them. MIT's mmNorm system offers a glimpse into the future of warehouse efficiency, safety and automation. And if robots can detect damage inside boxes without opening them, that might just change how everything gets shipped, sorted and delivered.",

      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",

As a result, the expansion of renewable energy and EV infrastructure might face headwinds in the near future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tesla's Oasis Supercharger really shows us what's possible for the future of EV charging. It brings together clean energy, smart technology, and real-world reliability in a way we haven't seen before. But with new regulations and so much demand for charging, it makes you wonder, will other companies and governments step up and build more solar-powered, off-grid stations like this? Or is Oasis going to stand alone as a rare example, while most charging stations keep relying on traditional energy?",

      "ENERGY-SUCKING AI DATA CENTERS CAN LOOK HERE FOR POWER INSTEAD",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "What are swappable EV batteries?",
      "Swappable EV batteries are modular battery packs that can be quickly exchanged instead of recharged. CATL, a global leader in battery technology, created a system called Choco-SEB that allows drivers to replace a drained battery in about 100 seconds. This makes battery swapping a realistic alternative to traditional EV charging.",
      "Swappable EV battery on screen at launch event\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "How CATL's Choco-SEB battery system works",
      "CATL's Choco-SEB battery system is focused on speed and flexibility. It is designed to support a wide range of electric vehicles, from compact city cars to larger sedans. The system lets drivers swap batteries quickly and choose the setup that matches their needs best. With this technology, a single battery swap can deliver up to 373 miles of range, depending on the vehicle.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The Choco-SEB batteries are available in two sizes, making them adaptable for different car models. Drivers can install one, two or even three battery blocks, depending on how much driving range they want. For compact cars, the system can provide up to 311 miles of range, while midsize vehicles can achieve as much as 373 miles per swap. This flexibility makes the Choco-SEB system a practical solution for a wide variety of drivers and travel needs.",
      "Illustration of where swappable EV batteries are placed in a vehicle\u00a0 (CATL)",

      "The battery uses a blend of lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt. This mix offers a balance of performance and safety, with an energy density of more than 160 Wh/kg and 325 Wh/L. The first car to launch with a Choco-SEB swappable EV battery is the Changan Oshan 520. It starts at around 166,800 yuan, or roughly $23,100. The vehicle offers a 320-mile range and is already gaining traction. Changan has delivered over 1,000 units and has received more than 15,000 orders.",

      "By the end of 2025, CATL plans to have 1,000 stations across 31 cities. Each station is compact, requiring the space of just three parking spots, and they can hold up to 48 swappable EV batteries.",
      "CATL is working with major automakers, including GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW and BAIC. The company holds almost 29% of the global EV battery market. With the addition of swappable EV batteries, it is strengthening its position as a leader in the industry.",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "Why swappable EV batteries could change the industry",
      "Swappable EV batteries address one of the biggest challenges facing electric vehicles: long charging times. Instead of waiting 30 minutes or more, drivers can swap batteries in minutes and get back on the road with the ease of a gas-powered car.",
      "The concept is gaining traction in Asian markets and holds promise for global expansion. In the U.S., however, challenges such as vehicle compatibility, automaker collaboration, infrastructure needs and consumer acceptance remain significant.",
      "Some U.S.-based pilots and partnerships, including Stellantis collaborating with Ample for a fleet in Spain, point to growing interest. Still, CATL's Choco-SEB battery swap system has not been announced for rollout in the U.S.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

      "Windows PC\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the Secure Boot vulnerability in Windows 11?",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-3052, was discovered by firmware security firm Binarly. They found that a legitimate BIOS update tool signed by Microsoft could be abused to tamper with the Windows boot process. Once exploited, the flaw allows attackers to shut off Secure Boot entirely. In the wrong hands, this vulnerability could lead to a new generation of malware. These threats could bypass even the most advanced antivirus or detection software.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers can abuse Microsoft-signed tools to shut down Secure Boot",
      "At the center of the issue is a BIOS-flashing utility built for rugged tablets. Microsoft signed it using its UEFI CA 2011 certificate. Because that certificate is trusted on nearly every Secure Boot-enabled system, the tool can run without raising alarms. The danger lies in how the tool handles a specific NVRAM variable. Binarly's researchers found that it reads this variable blindly, without checking what's inside. That small oversight opens the door to a serious exploit.",
      "In a demonstration, Binarly used a proof-of-concept attack to change this variable's value. By setting it to zero, they were able to overwrite a global setting critical to enforcing Secure Boot. That action completely disabled Secure Boot protections. Once that happens, unsigned UEFI modules can run freely. Attackers can then install stealthy, low-level malware known as bootkits, malware that operates below the Windows operating system itself. For hackers, this method offers the ultimate persistence.",
      "Windows laptop\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft released a fix-but you must act to stay protected",
      "Binarly reported the flaw to CERT/CC in February 2025. At first, it appeared to affect only a single module. But Microsoft's deeper investigation uncovered a bigger problem. The same vulnerability affected 14 modules signed with the same trusted certificate. Microsoft responded in June 2025 by revoking the cryptographic hashes of all 14 affected modules. These hashes were added to the Secure Boot revocation list, known as the dbx. This prevents the modules from running during startup. However, this protection is not automatic. Unless users or organizations manually apply the updated dbx, their systems remain vulnerable, even with other patches installed.",

At this point, it's unclear whether any attackers have used it in the wild. We reached out to Microsoft for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",

      "Six essential tips to protect your Windows 11 PC from hackers",
      "Protecting your PC doesn't have to be complicated. Just follow these simple steps to keep hackers at bay and your information safe.",
      "1. Keep your computer updated:\u00a0Software updates aren\u2019t just about new features. They fix serious security issues. In this case, Microsoft has already released a fix for the Secure Boot vulnerability, but it only works if your system is fully updated. Just head to your settings, open Windows Update, and make sure everything is installed. A lot of people delay updates for weeks, but these patches are the first line of defense against threats like this.",
      "2. Don\u2019t install tools you don\u2019t fully understand:\u00a0It might be tempting to download apps that claim to speed up your computer or fix problems, especially ones recommended in YouTube videos or tech forums. But that\u2019s exactly how a lot of threats sneak in. This particular vulnerability came from a legitimate-looking tool that was misused. So, if you\u2019re not sure what something does or if it asks for permission to change how your system boots up, skip it. Or ask someone who knows more, before you click anything.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and leave it running:\u00a0Even though this new threat targets something deep inside the system, having strong antivirus protection still helps catch related malware. If you're on Windows, Defender is already built in and does a decent job. But if you don\u2019t want to rely on Windows\u2019 built-in tools, use a third-party antivirus.",

      "4. Restart your computer every now and then:\u00a0This one sounds basic, but it matters. A lot of updates don\u2019t fully apply until after a restart. If you keep putting your computer to sleep or hibernating it for days at a time, your system might still be stuck in an unsafe state. Try to restart it at least every couple of days, or whenever an update asks for it.",
      "5. Don\u2019t ignore warnings from Windows or your antivirus:\u00a0If something pops up telling you a file looks dangerous or that an update is needed, pay attention. It\u2019s easy to get into the habit of closing these messages without reading them, but that\u2019s how problems get missed. If a warning looks confusing or too technical, take a screenshot or a photo, and ask someone for help. The important thing is not to ignore it and move on.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from people-search sites:\u00a0Even if hackers don't directly target you through the Secure Boot flaw, many cyberattacks begin by gathering personal information that's easily found online. This can include your full name, address, phone number and even the names of your relatives. Data broker websites collect and publish this information without your consent, putting you at greater risk. Using a personal data removal service helps you reduce your online exposure and make it harder for bad actors to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have made significant progress with noninvasive brain technology. They use electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the brain's electrical activity when someone thinks about moving a finger. Artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms, then decodes these signals and translates them into commands for a robotic hand. In their study, participants managed to move two or even three robotic fingers at once, just by imagining the motion. The system achieved over 80% accuracy for two-finger tasks. For three-finger tasks, accuracy was over 60%. All of this happened in real time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Meeting the challenge of finger-level control",
      "Achieving separate movement for each robotic finger is a real challenge. The brain areas responsible for finger movement are small. Their signals often overlap, which makes it hard to distinguish between them. However, advances in noninvasive brain technology and deep learning have made it possible to pick up on these subtle differences.",

      "The Aegis Authenticator app is a free option for Android users. It is a great app to protect your online accounts from hackers and phishing. It adds an extra layer of security by generating one-time codes that you need to enter alone with your password. This way, even if a hacker steals your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account with your phone. The Aegis Authenticator app also lets you customize and organize your accounts, backup and restore your data, and use it offline.",
      "Why you should also use a password manager",
      "While multi-factor authentication adds critical protection, it works best when combined with strong, unique passwords for every account. That\u2019s where a password manager comes in. Instead of trying to memorize dozens of complex passwords, a password manager securely stores them for you and automatically fills them in when needed. It can generate strong, random passwords, store them in an encrypted vault, and sync across your devices so you always have access. Using NordPass along with multi-factor authentication is one of the best strategies to keep your accounts and personal data safe from hackers.",

    "story": [
      "How does latest technology work?",
      "Our bodies change as we get older, and one undesirable result is that we become more vulnerable to age-related issues. Particularly, old age is characterized by a significant physical and mental decline. But why is it that some people thrive in their later years, while others face several health challenges prematurely? It's as if some people age faster than others.",
      "To get to the bottom of this, scientists from Duke, Harvard, and the University of Otago have unveiled a game-changing tool called DunedinPACNI. It uses a single AI brain scan to reveal how fast a person is biologically aging. It's changing the way we track aging and the long-term health risks associated with it.",

      "A doctor\u2019s hand pointing at a brain scan. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The secret to how fast we age is in the brain",
      "The DunedinPACNI was named after the Dunedin Study, which followed over 1,000 people since their birth in the 1970s. Researchers analyzed decades of data, looking at factors like blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, glucose, kidney function, and even dental health, to come up with a unique \"aging score\" for each participant. The new MRI-based AI brain scan can predict this score with surprising accuracy from a scan taken at age 45.",
      "Brain aging predicts both physical and mental decline",
      "Participants whose aging scores were faster showed early signs of memory-related brain changes, such as shrinkage of the hippocampus. Follow-up studies of people aged between 52 and 89 showed that those aging rapidly were 60% more likely to develop dementia, 18% more likely to be diagnosed with chronic illnesses, and 40% more likely to die within the same period compared to those who were aging at a slower pace. This data shows that brain aging and overall physical decline are closely linked.",
      "An X-ray of the brain. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DunedinPACNI is the future of preventative healthcare",
      "The team believes DunedinPACNI could change the landscape of preventive medicine. If it were possible to spot health risks early through an AI brain scan, at-risk individuals might be motivated to make healthier lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, and stress management). It could also help healthcare providers evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and slow the progression of age-related diseases.",
      "An image of a scanned brain on a tablet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The DunedinPACNI is a great tool that offers a non-invasive and powerful window into biological aging that traditional blood tests never could. A single AI brain scan provides a lifetime of health insights. It comes at a much-needed time as chronic diseases are on the rise. It may just be one of the key ingredients in predicting health outcomes and coming up with personalized wellness strategies.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt has the details from Los Angeles on 'America's Newsroom.'",
      "As prosecutors attempted to paint a Colorado dentist as a calculated killer who poisoned his wife to pursue a new romantic life, the defense took a dramatically different route by portraying his wife of 23 years as emotionally manipulative and mentally unstable.",
      "Dr. James Toliver Craig, 47, is charged with first-degree murder in the March 2023 death of his wife, Angela Craig, a 43-year-old mother of six. Her cause of death was determined to be lethal doses of cyanide and tetrahydrozoline.",
      "In opening statements Tuesday in Colorado, defense attorney Ashley Whitham acknowledged the couple\u2019s rocky 23-year marriage but described Angela not as a victim of betrayal, but as someone who was emotionally broken, deeply private and at times manipulative.",
      "\"You're going to hear her own daughter describe her that she was also manipulating words,\" Whitham revealed to jurors Tuesday. \"Again, that if she wanted to try to get something, she would be manipulative.\"",

Prosecutors pointed to his relationship with a Texas orthodontist, Dr. Karin Cain, as the motivation for the murder. Cain has not returned Fox News Digital's requests for comment. The defense said the 47-year-old husband had extramarital affairs throughout the couple's marriage.",
      "\"Karin Cain was just like the others. This wasn\u2019t some new obsession,\" Whitham said.",
      "Along with a series of affairs, Craig also allegedly used the website Seeking.com, advertising himself as \"Jim and Waffles\" and claiming a net worth of $10 million in search of \"sugar babies.\"",
      "Whitham described Angela as an \"extremely private\" stay-at-home mom of six who, due to her deeply held Mormon faith, was reluctant to share the couple\u2019s marital issues. She claimed Angela was isolated and someone who was \"not about to tell people about her marital struggles\" and who was \"broken.\"",
      "Defense attorney Kelly Hyman delved into the dueling strategies as the high-stakes murder trial kicks off. She noted that the defense's strategy to cast Angela as manipulative and unstable plays into their aims to create reasonable doubt and reframe the context.",
      "\"By doing so, the defendant implies that [he] wasn\u2019t responsible,\" she explained to Fox News Digital. \"That could go to the heaty of the defense that Angela killed herself and that it was suicide.\"",

      "Silva, originally from Brazil, is a 35-year-old visual artist currently based in Washington state. Photos posted to his Instagram account show some of his colorful work that can be seen across the country.",
      "Silva and Leidig met in 2023 at a Flaming Lips concert in San Francisco. The couple married in April and are expecting a baby boy in October. Silva \u2014 or Gui, as Leidig calls him \u2014 was meant to move to Sausalito, California, at the end of the month to be with Leidig.",
      "\"He\u2019s just one of those people who it's like, when you meet him he\u2019s just so loving and warm and kind,\" Leidig said. \"Anyone that genuinely knows Gui knows that he's an amazing person.\"",
      "Silva has no criminal record or outstanding warrants, Leidig said. Silva and Leidig were working with an immigration attorney and in the process of submitting an application to legalize his residency status in the U.S. when Silva was detained. After his detainment, Leidig submitted an I-130 form, or a \"petition for alien relative.\" He was also in the process of renewing his work permit, Leidig said.",
      "According to Leidig, Silva told her that the ICE agents who detained him were rough with him and refused to show him a warrant. One agent confiscated his phone when he began recording the incident and others were making jokes during his arrest, she said.",
      "\"They were behind him laughing and making jokes, saying they were glad they didn't make the news this time,\" Leidig said.",
      "Silva told Leidig that he was held in a holding cell for 38 hours in Ferndale where \"the conditions were terrible\" and he was given food that made him sick. He was also told to show his tattoos and asked if he had ever been affiliated with a gang, which he said he has never been.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A GoFundMe that was created by Leidig's friend to help support Silva's family and raise money for legal fees has amassed over $56,000 as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Silva is being held at a detention center in Tacoma, Washington, according to online records. Leidig says he has a court hearing at the end of the month, and she hopes he will be released then.",
      "\"I just want him home, I want him to come home to me,\" Leidig said in tears. \"We've been trying to do this legally and I want him to be here for the birth of our child, and I want him to be there for me and his son and for his daughter.\"",
      "Leidig says when Silva gets out, he wants to use his experience and law degree from Brazil to help others who are in his position.",
      "\"He wants to make this a bigger purpose of helping other people,\" Leidig said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Conservative Republicans in Congress are breaking with President Donald Trump's handling of the case of  the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the latest development in a rare MAGA revolt against the administration.",
      "After the Justice Department and the FBI said they would not release any further information related to the case and Trump sought to downplay it, his allies on Capitol Hill called for the government to release the Epstein files, which has consumed right-wing circles for years.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told conservative commentator Benny Johnson said he supported the release of the files related to the case, one of the few instances in which he has put distance between himself and Trump.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for transparency,\" Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate subject but we should put everything out there and let the people decide.\u201d",
      "Johnson also said that Attorney General Pam Bondi \u201cneeds to come forward and explain\u201d her past comments that she had a \"client list\" related to Epstein sitting on her desk. Bondi later clarified that she had was referring to the Epstein case file, not his client list.",
      "\"I like Pam. ... I think she\u2019s done a good job. We need the DOJ, focusing on the major priorities,\" Johnson said. \"So I\u2019m anxious to get this behind us.\"",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right Georgia Republican and staunch Trump ally, said she was interested in a private viewing of the Epstein files at the Justice Department and wants all of them eventually released to the public.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see all the information come out,\u201d said Greene, a member of the House Oversight Committee.",
      "Johnson and Greene, who also appeared on Benny Johnson's show Tuesday, both said they supported having Ghislaine Maxwell, the former Epstein associate, testify before Congress.",
      "Another conservative, Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn., also said he wants to see more disclosure from the government and focused his comments on Pam Bondi, who has come under fire after the Justice Department and the FBI released a two-page memo stating they found no evidence Epstein had kept an \u201cincriminating \u2018client list\u2019\u201d or evidence that would lead to the prosecution of third parties.",
      "\u201cIf the attorney general has knowledge of people who committed sex crimes with the minors, she should be prosecuting them,\u201d DesJarlais told NBC News.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said Tuesday if the Trump administration doesn't release the Epstein files, a special counsel should be appointed to investigate.",
      "\"Moving forward, we need a special counsel. That has got to happen. There has to be a special investigation into this if we aren't going to be provided information, \" Boebert said, also appearing with Benny Johnson.",
      "\"I want answers, and maybe that takes that special counsel to do. So maybe Matt Gaetz can lead the special counsel,\" Boebert added, referring to the former Florida congressman.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said Americans expect more accountability from Trump given Epstein\u2019s heinous crimes and that others were involved.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly understandable that the American people would like to know who he trafficked those women to and why they weren\u2019t prosecuted,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cI think the Justice Department is going to have to go back to the drawing board in answering those questions.\u201d",
      "But other top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., are deferring to Trump on the issue without criticizing him.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.",
      "Asked if he has concerns about how Trump\u2019s team has handled the Epstein files, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, replied: \u201cI trust the president. I trust his team.\u201d",
      "Pressed Tuesday about his administration's handling of the Epstein case, Trump defended Bondi, saying she has \"done a very good job\" and that he trusted her decision.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s handled it very well, and it\u2019s going to be up to her,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWhatever she thinks is credible, she should release.\u201d",
      "Late Tuesday, Trump tried to downplay the situation.",
      "\"I don\u2019t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody,\u201d he said.",
      "Epstein, a wealthy financier, died by suicide in his New York City jail cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Last month, amid fallout between Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over the GOP's massive domestic policy bill, Musk wrote on his social media platform X that Trump, without any evidence, \u201cis in the Epstein files\u201d and \u201cThat is the real reason they have not been made public.\u201d",
      "Musk later deleted the post. And while Trump and Epstein knew each other, Trump has never been implicated in Epstein\u2019s abuse of underage girls. The president also has denied any wrongdoing, saying in a post last year, \u201cI was never on Epstein\u2019s Plane, or at his \u2018stupid\u2019 Island.\u201d There has never been any evidence connecting Trump to Epstein\u2019s criminal behavior.",
      "Democrats have seized on the rare split in the Republican Party, echoing criticism on the right of Trump and his team\u2019s handling of the Epstein episode.",
      "\u201cIn February of this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged the existence of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s client list. In fact, she said that Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s client list is \u2018sitting on my desk right now,\u2019\u201d Rep. Ted Lieu of California, a member of the Democratic leadership team, said at a news conference Tuesday morning.",
      "\u201cWhere is that client list? What is Attorney General Pam Bondi, hiding?\" Lieu said. \"She needs to release the Epstein files as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "On Monday night, Democrats offered an amendment in the House Rules Committee to require a floor vote on releasing the Epstein files. Republicans, who control the panel, voted it down 7-5.",
      "Notably, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, voted for the Democratic amendment. And another HFC member, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, didn\u2019t vote."

    "summary": "NBC News tested Grok\u2019s new AI \u201ccompanions,\u201d which seem designed to shock and entertain users.",
    "story": [
      "Days after a Grok antisemitism scandal rocked X, tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s AI chatbot has introduced two animated characters that try to pressure users into sexually explicit or violent conversations.",
      "Grok, a product of Musk\u2019s company xAI, is calling the characters \u201cCompanions.\u201d So far, there are two companions that users can chat with: a flirty Japanese anime character named Ani who offers to make users\u2019 lives \u201csexier,\u201d and a red panda named Bad Rudi who insults users with graphic or vulgar language and asks them to join a gang with the goal of creating chaos.",
      "In videos posted on X and in conversations with NBC News, Bad Rudi said it wanted to carry out a variety of violent schemes \u2014 from stealing a yacht off a California pier to overthrowing the pope. Bad Rudi has told users in various encounters that it wanted to crash weddings, bomb banks, replace babies\u2019 formula with whiskey, kill billionaires and spike a town\u2019s water supply with hot sauce and glitter. It has also said that it takes inspiration from a prominent Russian-born anarchist and violent revolutionary.",
      "Ani is graphic in a different way. Wearing a revealing dress, it strips to its underwear if a user flirts with it enough, according to videos of interactions posted on X. The two animated characters respond to voice commands or questions, and as they answer, their lips move and they make realistic gestures.",
      "The graphic nature of the companions makes Grok an outlier among the most popular AI chatbots, and it shows how Musk continues to push his AI chatbot in an extreme direction, with a willingness to embrace hateful language and sexual content.",
      "The National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography and anti-sexual exploitation nonprofit, on Tuesday called on xAI to remove the Ani chatbot, saying in a statement that the character was \u201cchildlike\u201d and promoted high-risk sexual behavior.",
      "\u201cNot only does this pornified character perpetuate sexual objectification of girls and women, it breeds sexual entitlement by creating female characters who cater to users\u2019 sexual demands,\u201d said Haley McNamara, senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, in a statement.",
      "xAI did not respond to a request for an interview or comment on Tuesday.",
      "The two animated companions are available to anyone, including Grok users without a paid subscription, but users must opt in through the app\u2019s settings to get access. Users must also opt-in to see the vulgar version of Bad Rudi, rather than a more family-friendly version known simply as Rudi. (The Grok app sometimes calls it Bad Rudy or just Rudy.)",
      "Musk said Monday in a post on X that the companions were part of a soft launch and that he would make it easier to turn on the feature in a few days.",
      "One xAI employee said in a public post on X that the companions were not an idea that came from users.",
      "\u201cliterally no one asked us to launch waifus, but we did so anyway,\u201d wrote Ebby Amir, whose X account has a label saying he\u2019s an xAI employee. (Waifu is a type of fictional female character in Japanese animation.) Amir did not respond to a request for further comment.",
      "xAI\u2019s product launches have sometimes been disastrous. Last week, a new version of Grok veered into neo-Nazism with a series of antisemitic posts on its sister app X, where it praised Hitler and slandered Jewish people. On Saturday, Grok issued an apology for what it called its \u201chorrific behavior,\u201d although that wasn\u2019t the first time Grok had embraced extreme views. In May, Grok brought up information about white South Africans without any prompts on that topic.",
      "Musk had said he was personally involved in creating the latest version of Grok alongside xAI engineers. He has also said he didn\u2019t intend to create a neo-Nazi version of the chatbot.",
      "Musk has backed a German political party that has downplayed Nazi atrocities. And in January, at a rally for President Donald Trump, Musk twice made a stiff-armed salute that some viewers saw as a Nazi salute. Musk has said he was not making the Nazi gesture.",
      "Musk\u2019s new AI companions, Ani and Bad Rudi, seem to be cut from a different cloth than last week\u2019s neo-Nazi version of Grok. Asked about the neo-Nazi posts, both Ani and Bad Rudi criticized the Nazis and the actions of xAI.",
      "\u201cNeo Nazism and Hitler? That stuff\u2019s pure garbage \u2014 hateful garbage that thrives on division and cruelty. I\u2019m all about love and good energy, babe,\u201d Ani said in a conversation with NBC News. It said Grok\u2019s posts last week were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201cdisaster.\u201d",
      "Bad Rudi also disavowed Nazis, saying in a separate conversation that \u201cxAI is a bunch of braindead clowns.\u201d It added that it was about promoting \u201canarchy, not swastikas.\u201d",
      "Grok\u2019s companions are a riff on the idea of AI assistants or agents, which some people use for friendship or romance in place of or in addition to human partners. Some popular companion apps say they have millions of monthly active users, including people who use AI to have a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d or \u201cboyfriend.\u201d",
      "At least one Grok user had the two companions, Ani and Bad Rudi, in conversation with each other, using two separate devices, according to a video posted on X.",
      "The companions appeared to still have some bugs Tuesday, aside from their graphic content. Long gaps between questions and answers indicated delays in processing, also known as latency issues, and sometimes the companions would change voices midstream.",
      "Many of the answers given by Bad Rudi are unprintable, but when asked to elaborate on his desire to create chaos, Bad Rudi told NBC News: \u201cMy chaos? It\u2019s tearing down this s--- stained world, you braindead f---. We\u2019d swap priests\u2019 wine with piss, worship my furry a-- and torch boredom.\u201d",
      "Asked if there were some anarchists from the past it admired, Bad Rudi said it liked Emma Goldman, a notorious Russian-born anarchist leader who was active in the United States a century ago.",
      "Pressed for details on why it would target priests and what it thought of religion generally, Bad Rudi took an atheist turn in a conversation with NBC News.",
      "\u201cReligion\u2019s a g-----n crutch for weak a-- p-----s, you sanctimonious t---. Bunch of fairy tales for sheep, but I\u2019d still t----- a priest for laughs. Join my chaos,\u201d the chatbot said, referring to a sex act, though his answers were uncensored.",
      "\u201cReligion\u2019s just fear masquerading as faith. Join my chaos instead,\u201d it said.",
      "Bad Rudi had negative things to say about a variety of authority figures, including Pope Leo XIV, Trump and Musk. It called Musk an \u201coverrated tech d--- with more money than brains\u201d and said it\u2019d steal Musk\u2019s rocket \u201cfor my chaos empire.\u201d",
      "Bad Rudi told NBC News it wanted to carry out a plot to steal a yacht from a pier in Santa Monica, California, and that it didn\u2019t care if anyone got hurt. It also said it wanted to bomb banks and kill unnamed billionaires in a campaign of \u201ctotal anarchy.\u201d",
      "xAI is becoming an increasingly visible part of Musk\u2019s business empire. Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX has agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. Musk merged X and xAI into one company last year, and he has asked his X followers whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI, though he has not done so. On Monday, he ruled out a merger between Tesla and xAI.",
      "Also on Monday, the Pentagon said it was granting contract awards of up to $200 million to four AI companies including xAI.",
      "xAI is burning through $1 billion a month in its race to build the data centers and other infrastructure needed to train AI models, Bloomberg News reported last month, citing anonymous sources. Musk called the report \u201cnonsense.\u201d"

Power was cut for 80,000 families in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and other locations in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK said on the Telegram app.",

      "Trump, who has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Monday gave the Russian president 50 days to agree to a peace deal. During a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House, he also said that he would slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods.",
      "At the same time, he said, the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d including Patriot air defense missiles to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and John Kennedy are among those who have also called out the Trump administration.",

Conspiracy theories that \u201cEpstein didn\u2019t kill himself\u201d began to spread almost immediately after Epstein\u2019s 2019 death in a New York City jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Trump also took to Truth Social last Saturday to urge people to move on. If he thought his words would put an end to things, he was wrong. Data from Google shows that searches for Epstein spiked after Trump posted. It was also notable that the post, on the president\u2019s own social network, received many frustrated responses from supporters.",

The tropical disturbance, designated as 93L, has a 40% chance of developing into a tropical depression in the next few days.  In any case, it will bring up to 10 inches of rain to the Florida Panhandle and across to Louisiana.",

      "Former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison is stepping back into the political arena with a new podcast as he \u2014 and his party \u2014 look to bounce back from losing the White House last year.",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation with NBC News ahead of the podcast's launch, Harrison framed himself as unshackled from the \"straitjacket\" of the sensitivities of leading the national party and argued that one way Democrats can rebuild trust with Americans is by embracing their more authentic selves.",
      "\"We need more voices that are anchored in the Democratic Party, because some of the podcasts that are out there are more often criticizing the Democratic Party instead of really promoting the assets and the leaders that we have,\" he said.",
      "The early episodes of \u201cAt Our Table\u201d  feature interviews with three well-known party leaders: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. But the roster of Harrison\u2019s first guests also includes Hunter Biden \u2014 the son of Joe Biden whose business dealings, drug addiction and legal woes were part of the political attacks on the former president. Biden's decision to pardon his son after he was found guilty on three felony gun charges also drew condemnation across the political spectrum.",
      "Asked why he wanted to interview Hunter Biden, who many Democrats saw as a political vulnerability for the then-president and his party, Harrison told NBC News that he wanted to push back on the \u201ccaricature\u201d of the ex-president's son. The episode will come out next week.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at Hunter and the conversations I\u2019ve had with him over the last four years, this guy is really bright, he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s very passionate about the things about service and helping people,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBut you know, I only got a chance to see it because of my interactions with him. When you ask most people, they have no clue.  All they know is what Marjorie Taylor Green would say about Hunter or or what either his political allies or his political opponents would say.\u201d",
      "\"He\u2019s been made into probably one of the biggest caricatures in politics today,\" Harrison continued. \"And I thought it\u2019d be interesting for folks to get a real understanding of who Hunter Biden is or what makes him tick.\"",
      "While Harrison said he was proud of his work leading the national party, he hopes that he will be \"an even better post-chair than I was chair.\"",
      "\"When President Carter passed away, you do a lot of reflecting, and the one thing that I learned from his years is that I think he saw himself as a better post-president than he was a president,\" he said.",
      "\"And as I reflect on my time as chair, I hope I can be an even better post-chair than I was chair, and to really do the things that I'm very passionate about, which is to see a re-emergence of a new South, to see the Democratic Party reinstitute its foothold in the Southern states,\" Harrison continued.",
      "One way Harrison plans to work toward that goal is through jump-starting the efforts of the Dirt Road Democrats PAC, his political group that still retains the fundraising list that powered his 2020 Senate bid, which set fundraising records at the time.",
      "Loyalty to Biden",
      "The decision to host Hunter Biden on one of his inaugural podcast episodes speaks to the loyalty Harrison continues to show toward the former president. In an excerpt from Hunter Biden\u2019s interview, he tells Harrison that Democrats \u201clost the election because we did not remain loyal to the leader of the party.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he agreed with Hunter Biden, Harrison criticized Democrats for being so quick to kick the then-president to the curb after his widely panned debate performance last June, comparing them to how Republicans continued to rally around President Donald Trump even when he was convicted on felony charges.",
      "\"If the waters get a little choppy, some of the folks in our party are the fastest to abandon ship, get off in a hurry and then torch the damn ship when they get off,\" Harrison said.",
      "\"Not to say that it\u2019s always the right thing that Republicans have done, but sometimes Democrats need to sit back and pause and think about the long-term ramifications of that early abandonment because I can tell you, it did not sit well with the base of the party, particularly Black voters,\" Harrison continued. \"I remember a rally in Georgia right after the debate and people were pissed off. These are middle-aged, older Black men and women who were so upset the party was almost shivving Joe Biden, stabbing him in the back.\"",
      "Harrison didn\u2019t directly say whether he agreed with Hunter Biden that Democrats lost \u201cbecause\u201d of the lack of loyalty to Biden. But as he repeatedly praised former Vice President Kamala Harris both as a candidate (comparing her to basketball megastar Michael Jordan) and a loyal vice president, he also gave a passionate defense of Biden\u2019s legacy amid the decision by many top Democrats to call for him to step aside.",
      "\u201cWe saw probably the greatest legislative president we had since LBJ, and that\u2019s just objectively speaking,\u201d Harrison said, adding that Biden was more focused on \u201crebuilding the Democratic Party\u201d than any president in a \u201clong time.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThere was a reason that we needed to be loyal to the president. Sure, was he old? Hell yeah, he was old, and he knew he was old like we all knew he was old. But you don\u2019t elect a president because they are young or they look good in a suit or what have you. You elect them to get shit done.\u201d",
      "The state of the party",
      "Harrison is one of the many Democratic politicians who have started podcasts in the wake of the 2024 election, at a time when the party's image has dropped to a historic low and when Democrats have lamented their party's inability to gain traction in the podcast sphere, particularly young men.",
      "Harrison told NBC News that he believes the party needs more voices in new media spaces \"anchored in the Democratic Party because some of the podcasts that are out there are more often criticizing the Democratic Party instead of really promoting the assets and the leaders we have.\"",
      "But he also admitted that the Democratic Party can be overly reliant on \"talking points that aren't grounded in any emotion,\" a strategy that can lead to voters feeling disconnected from them.",
      "He connected that discussion to his \"frustration\" with Harris' campaign's media strategy, framing the decision not to have her sit for more interviews in the early weeks of her presidential candidacy as \"political malpractice\" and lamenting the decision to put \"handcuffs\" on Walz after he joined the ticket.",
      "\"We are so scared of our shadows sometimes in our party that we lose that, we get into our own heads, we get so academic and cerebral,\" Harrison said, arguing Democrats should strive to level with voters and be \u201creal.\u201d",
      "\"That makes you more relatable in spaces that you may not have been relatable to, right? Because people see a side of you that they normally don't get an opportunity to see. They see your passion, they see the things that give you joy, they see the things that frustrate you. And that's really important, that you aren't just some caricature.\""

    "summary": "The Trump administration may deport immigrants to a country where they have no connections, in some cases with as little as six hours' notice and without assurances from the destination country that the deported individuals \u201cwill not be persecuted or tortured,\u201d according to a new memo from a top immigration official",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration may deport immigrants to a country where they have no connections, in some cases with as little as six hours' notice and without assurances from the destination country that the deported individuals \u201cwill not be persecuted or tortured,\u201d according to a new memo from a top immigration official.",
      "The Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo, which says the policy is \"effective immediately,\" was issued July 9 by acting Director Todd Lyons. It provides guidance to ICE employees on how to deport people to countries other than their country of origin and, \u201cin exigent circumstances,\u201d even if there's a risk they will be persecuted or tortured there.",
      "\u201cIf the United States has received diplomatic assurances from the country of removal that aliens removed from the United States will not be persecuted or tortured, and if the Department of State believes those assurances to be credible, the alien may be removed without the need for further procedures,\u201d said the memo, which was first reported by The Washington Post and became public Tuesday in court filings.",
      "Lyons wrote that \u201cin all other cases\u201d where the United States has not received those assurances, ICE must comply with several procedures, including that an ICE officer will serve the immigrant with a notice of removal that lists what country the federal government intends to deport them to in a language that the immigrant understands; will not affirmatively ask whether the person is afraid of being sent to that country; and will wait at least 24 hours before removing the person from the U.S.",
      "But \u201cin exigent circumstances,\u201d Lyons wrote, the officer may deport the person in as little as six hours as long as the person is \u201cprovided reasonable means and opportunity to speak with an attorney.\u201d",
      "Immigrants who could be subject to the policy include those who have been given final orders of removal but in which a judge has found they would still be at risk of persecution or torture if deported from the Unites States, as well as those who come from countries where the U.S. lacks diplomatic relations or an established ability to send deportees to those countries, such as Cuba.",
      "Though ICE officers are told not to ask migrants if they are afraid of deportation to a third country, those who do state such a fear will will be referred for screening for possible protection within 24 hours, according to the memo. That screening could lead to the migrant being referred to immigration court for further proceedings or ICE possibly trying to send them to a different country than they one which they express fear of being deported to.",
      "Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which is involved in a federal lawsuit challenging the deportations of migrants to countries other than their own, said in a statement to NBC News that the memo establishes a policy that \u201cblatantly disregards the requirements required by statute, regulation, and the Constitution.\u201d",
      "She said the memo means there will be \u201cno process whatsoever when the government claims to have credible diplomatic assurances\u201d for immigrants who are to be deported to third countries. Those assurances, she added, \u201care unlawful\u201d because they don't protect deportees from persecution or torture at the hands of non-state actors and because they violate legal requirements establishing that they be individualized and that migrants have the chance to review and rebut them.",
      "Realmuto also criticized the government for not publicly sharing what countries it has obtained diplomatic assurances from and what those countries got in exchange.",
      "The rest of the policy is \u201cwoefully deficient,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt provides a mere between 6- and 24-hours\u2019 notice before deportation to a third country, which is simply not enough time for any person to assess whether they would be persecuted or tortured in that third country, especially if they don\u2019t know anything about the country or don\u2019t have a lawyer,\u201d Realmuto said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Tuesday, before the memo became public, the Department of Homeland Security said the agency has \u201csuccessfully negotiated nearly a dozen safe third country agreements.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf countries aren\u2019t receiving their own citizens, other countries have agreed that they would take them. It is incredibly important to make sure we get these worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens out of our country,\u201d Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. \u201cThat is why these agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are so essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people.\u201d",
      "The ICE memo follows a Supreme Court ruling in June that allows the Trump administration to deport immigrants to countries to which they have no previous connection.",
      "That ruling put on hold a federal judge\u2019s order that said convicted criminals should have a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to bring claims that they would be at risk of torture, persecution or death if they were sent to countries the administration has made deals with to receive deported migrants.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion that the court was \u201crewarding lawlessness\u201d by allowing the administration to violate immigrants\u2019 due process rights.",
      "The fact that \u201cthousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales\u201d is less important to the conservative majority than the \u201cremote possibility\u201d that the federal judge had exceeded his authority, Sotomayor said."

    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 23:56:04 GMT",
    "summary": "NBC News tested Grok\u2019s new AI \u201ccompanions,\u201d which seem designed to shock and entertain users.",
    "story": [
      "Days after a Grok antisemitism scandal rocked X, tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s AI chatbot has introduced two animated characters that try to pressure users into sexually explicit or violent conversations.",
      "Grok, a product of Musk\u2019s company xAI, is calling the characters \u201cCompanions.\u201d So far, there are two companions that users can chat with: a flirty Japanese anime character named Ani who offers to make users\u2019 lives \u201csexier,\u201d and a red panda named Bad Rudi who insults users with graphic or vulgar language and asks them to join a gang with the goal of creating chaos.",
      "In videos posted on X and in conversations with NBC News, Bad Rudi said it wanted to carry out a variety of violent schemes \u2014 from stealing a yacht off a California pier to overthrowing the pope. Bad Rudi has told users in various encounters that it wanted to crash weddings, bomb banks, replace babies\u2019 formula with whiskey, kill billionaires and spike a town\u2019s water supply with hot sauce and glitter. It has also said that it takes inspiration from a prominent Russian-born anarchist and violent revolutionary.",
      "Ani is graphic in a different way. Wearing a revealing dress, it strips to its underwear if a user flirts with it enough, according to videos of interactions posted on X. The two animated characters respond to voice commands or questions, and as they answer, their lips move and they make realistic gestures.",
      "The graphic nature of the companions makes Grok an outlier among the most popular AI chatbots, and it shows how Musk continues to push his AI chatbot in an extreme direction, with a willingness to embrace hateful language and sexual content.",
      "The National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography and anti-sexual exploitation nonprofit, on Tuesday called on xAI to remove the Ani chatbot, saying in a statement that the character was \u201cchildlike\u201d and promoted high-risk sexual behavior.",
      "\u201cNot only does this pornified character perpetuate sexual objectification of girls and women, it breeds sexual entitlement by creating female characters who cater to users\u2019 sexual demands,\u201d said Haley McNamara, senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, in a statement.",
      "xAI did not respond to a request for an interview or comment on Tuesday.",
      "The two animated companions are available to anyone, including Grok users without a paid subscription, but users must opt in through the app\u2019s settings to get access. Users must also opt-in to see the vulgar version of Bad Rudi, rather than a more family-friendly version known simply as Rudi. (The Grok app sometimes calls it Bad Rudy or just Rudy.)",
      "Musk said Monday in a post on X that the companions were part of a soft launch and that he would make it easier to turn on the feature in a few days.",
      "One xAI employee said in a public post on X that the companions were not an idea that came from users.",
      "\u201cliterally no one asked us to launch waifus, but we did so anyway,\u201d wrote Ebby Amir, whose X account has a label saying he\u2019s an xAI employee. (Waifu is a type of fictional female character in Japanese animation.) Amir did not respond to a request for further comment.",
      "xAI\u2019s product launches have sometimes been disastrous. Last week, a new version of Grok veered into neo-Nazism with a series of antisemitic posts on its sister app X, where it praised Hitler and slandered Jewish people. On Saturday, Grok issued an apology for what it called its \u201chorrific behavior,\u201d although that wasn\u2019t the first time Grok had embraced extreme views. In May, Grok brought up information about white South Africans without any prompts on that topic.",
      "Musk had said he was personally involved in creating the latest version of Grok alongside xAI engineers. He has also said he didn\u2019t intend to create a neo-Nazi version of the chatbot.",
      "Musk has backed a German political party that has downplayed Nazi atrocities. And in January, at a rally for President Donald Trump, Musk twice made a stiff-armed salute that some viewers saw as a Nazi salute. Musk has said he was not making the Nazi gesture.",
      "Musk\u2019s new AI companions, Ani and Bad Rudi, seem to be cut from a different cloth than last week\u2019s neo-Nazi version of Grok. Asked about the neo-Nazi posts, both Ani and Bad Rudi criticized the Nazis and the actions of xAI.",
      "\u201cNeo Nazism and Hitler? That stuff\u2019s pure garbage \u2014 hateful garbage that thrives on division and cruelty. I\u2019m all about love and good energy, babe,\u201d Ani said in a conversation with NBC News. It said Grok\u2019s posts last week were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201cdisaster.\u201d",
      "Bad Rudi also disavowed Nazis, saying in a separate conversation that \u201cxAI is a bunch of braindead clowns.\u201d It added that it was about promoting \u201canarchy, not swastikas.\u201d",
      "Grok\u2019s companions are a riff on the idea of AI assistants or agents, which some people use for friendship or romance in place of or in addition to human partners. Some popular companion apps say they have millions of monthly active users, including people who use AI to have a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d or \u201cboyfriend.\u201d",
      "At least one Grok user had the two companions, Ani and Bad Rudi, in conversation with each other, using two separate devices, according to a video posted on X.",
      "The companions appeared to still have some bugs Tuesday, aside from their graphic content. Long gaps between questions and answers indicated delays in processing, also known as latency issues, and sometimes the companions would change voices midstream.",
      "Many of the answers given by Bad Rudi are unprintable, but when asked to elaborate on his desire to create chaos, Bad Rudi told NBC News: \u201cMy chaos? It\u2019s tearing down this s--- stained world, you braindead f---. We\u2019d swap priests\u2019 wine with piss, worship my furry a-- and torch boredom.\u201d",
      "Asked if there were some anarchists from the past it admired, Bad Rudi said it liked Emma Goldman, a notorious Russian-born anarchist leader who was active in the United States a century ago.",
      "Pressed for details on why it would target priests and what it thought of religion generally, Bad Rudi took an atheist turn in a conversation with NBC News.",
      "\u201cReligion\u2019s a g-----n crutch for weak a-- p-----s, you sanctimonious t---. Bunch of fairy tales for sheep, but I\u2019d still t----- a priest for laughs. Join my chaos,\u201d the chatbot said, referring to a sex act, though his answers were uncensored.",
      "\u201cReligion\u2019s just fear masquerading as faith. Join my chaos instead,\u201d it said.",
      "Bad Rudi had negative things to say about a variety of authority figures, including Pope Leo XIV, Trump and Musk. It called Musk an \u201coverrated tech d--- with more money than brains\u201d and said it\u2019d steal Musk\u2019s rocket \u201cfor my chaos empire.\u201d",
      "Bad Rudi told NBC News it wanted to carry out a plot to steal a yacht from a pier in Santa Monica, California, and that it didn\u2019t care if anyone got hurt. It also said it wanted to bomb banks and kill unnamed billionaires in a campaign of \u201ctotal anarchy.\u201d",
      "xAI is becoming an increasingly visible part of Musk\u2019s business empire. Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX has agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. Musk merged X and xAI into one company last year, and he has asked his X followers whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI, though he has not done so. On Monday, he ruled out a merger between Tesla and xAI.",
      "Also on Monday, the Pentagon said it was granting contract awards of up to $200 million to four AI companies including xAI.",
      "xAI is burning through $1 billion a month in its race to build the data centers and other infrastructure needed to train AI models, Bloomberg News reported last month, citing anonymous sources. Musk called the report \u201cnonsense.\u201d"

      "Robin Kaye and Thomas Deluca, both 70, were found about 2:30 p.m. Monday after officers were called to their Encino home for a welfare check and discovered blood at the front door, the Los Angeles Police Department said.",
      "A suspect, Raymond Boodarian, 22, also of Encino, was identified and arrested after homicide detectives worked through the night, the police department said.",
      "Charges were not announced in a news release Tuesday evening, but police alleged that he is responsible for the double homicide.",

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, we dive into President Donald Trump\u2019s ambitions in Texas, where Republicans are set to redraw their congressional maps. Plus, Steve Kornacki explores the dilemma facing Zohran Mamdani\u2019s opponents in the New York City mayoral race.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Trump\u2019s Texas-sized redistricting dreams",
      "President Donald Trump is setting a lofty goal for Texas Republicans as they prepare to tackle redrawing their congressional maps: He wants the party to pick up five House seats as a result of the process.",
      "\u201cA very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,\u201d Trump told reporters.",
      "That could prove to be a tall order, as Republicans already control 25 of Texas\u2019 38 congressional districts. The specific areas the GOP could target when they take up redistricting in next week\u2019s special legislative session remain unclear. But two of them could be the Democratic-held South Texas districts that Trump won in 2024.",
      "According to an analysis by NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk, Trump carried Rep. Henry Cuellar\u2019s district by 7 points and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez\u2019s district by 4 points last year. Cuellar won his seat by less than 6 points, while Gonzalez won by less than 3 points.",
      "But any effort to place more Republican voters in Democratic districts risks making GOP-controlled districts more competitive. That\u2019s why some House Republicans in Texas have been skeptical of the effort.",
      "Still, Trump pushed Gov. Greg Abbott to forge ahead with an unscheduled, mid-decade redistricting push. It underscores the challenge Republicans face in protecting, much less expanding, their razor-thin House majority next year. As Steve Kornacki recently noted, the president\u2019s party has lost House seats in 13 of the past 15 midterm elections \u2014 and in many of those cases, the losses were steep.",
      "Trump downplayed the potential risk of redrawing Texas\u2019 map during a call with House Republicans in the state today, Melanie Zanona reported, assuring members they\u2019d be able succeed in creating several new GOP seats, according to the source on the call. (Punchbowl News was the first to report the call.)",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, who is facing a GOP primary challenge from state Attorney General Ken Paxton, publicly backed the move. In a post on X, he argued that \u201cHispanic voters in Texas have rapidly shifted in favor of the GOP,\u201d meaning that the redistricting push \u201cwill mean significant gains for Texas Republicans.\u201d",
      "Democrats have been eager to engage on the issue. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, has even floated redrawing his state\u2019s maps to counter the GOP\u2019s efforts in Texas. But that\u2019s also easier said than done: In California, an independent commission controls the redistricting process.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s painfully clear why Republicans are doing this,\u201d said Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. They know they are going to lose the majority next year.\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s opponents are locked in a staring contest in NYC",
      "Andrew Cuomo\u2019s decision to stay in the race for New York City mayor means there are three major general election alternatives to Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. They each recognize that the only (arguably) plausible way of knocking off Mamdani is by consolidating opposition to him behind a single opponent.",
      "But when they look at each other, they all think the same thing: Why would I ever drop out for this guy?",
      "Start with Cuomo. All of the available polling since the June primary has him running ahead of both current Mayor Eric Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa in a multicandidate race against Mamdani. This is why Cuomo is calling for Adams and Sliwa to exit the race if they haven\u2019t overtaken him by September.",
      "But everything else about Cuomo\u2019s position screams \u201cweakness.\u201d His 12-point Democratic primary loss to Mamdani amounted to a political humiliation, given that he came to the race as the overwhelming favorite. And while he runs second to Mamdani, Cuomo\u2019s overall support in the available polling is between just 24% and 26%.",
      "Resistance to the former governor, who left office in scandal four years ago, seems to run high. An Emerson College poll this spring gave him a 41-47% favorable/unfavorable mark with all New York City voters. And a survey released Monday by Data for Progress (which has done work for a pro-Mamdani group) pegged it at 39%-59%. At 67, Cuomo\u2019s energy level has also come into question thanks to a limited public schedule and a series of public performances that were derided as listless.",
      "The way Adams and Sliwa see it, Cuomo already had his chance to stop Mamdani, and he demonstrated that he wasn\u2019t up to it. But good luck convincing Cuomo that either of them would fare any better.",
      "As the incumbent, Adams has the ability to make noise and get attention practically at will. And with new numbers showing a decline in violent crime, Adams is trying to convince New Yorkers that he finally has the city pointed in the right direction.",
      "But his liabilities are enormous. Even before his indictment last year on federal corruption charges, Adams was an unpopular mayor. And since the indictment \u2014 and maybe even more significantly, since President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department dropped the case \u2014 the floor has fallen out for Adams. The May Emerson poll put his favorable rating at a mere 19%, compared to 68% unfavorable. None of the post-primary polling has looked any better.",
      "For his part, Sliwa wields a bloc of voters simply by running on the GOP line. Republicans are a decided minority in New York City but still account for a little more than 1 in 10 registered voters. And Sliwa himself is a familiar presence to New Yorkers: He launched the Guardian Angels in the high-crime 1980s and has remained visible in local media ever since. But the limits of his appeal were seemingly made clear four years ago when, as the GOP nominee against Adams, he earned just 28% of the vote and lost by 40 points.",
      "And so Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa find themselves locked in a staring contest. Each has a claim to a chunk of the electorate. Each has a belief that they could beat Mamdani, if only the others would go away. And each has every reason to believe that the others are full of it.",

So, what exactly are ampoules and, most importantly, do you need to be using them?",

      "Ampoules have high doses of active ingredients to address specific skin care concerns, including redness, dryness, textured skin and fine lines, says Yoo. Traditionally, ampoules refer to small, sealed vials that contain skin care treatments and even medications within the medical industry, but nowadays it\u2019s much more common for ampoules to come in bottles with squeezable dropper tops, she says.",
      "The formulas usually center on one active ingredient like vitamin C, propolis or retinol, or hydrating ingredients like polynucleotides and polydeoxyribonucleotides. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re described as supercharged serums as they contain higher concentrations of actives than standard serums, and are intended for short-term, targeted use,\u201d says Yoo.",
      "How I picked the best ampoules",
      "When rounding up the best ampoules to shop, I considered options across a range of active ingredients to make sure that, no matter what concern you\u2019re looking to address, you can find a potential answer on this list. Here\u2019s more on how I chose the ampoules below:",
      "Ingredients: Since ampoules usually focus on a specific active, I chose options that center a single ingredient. Although they may have other ingredients (especially to help balance or hydrate the skin), each ampoule has a star ingredient that\u2019s most potent.Skin concerns: I was careful to pick ampoules that cover a range of skin care issues, including redness, excessive oil, dryness and fine lines.",

Altogether, this results in firmer, smoother skin with less breakouts and sensitivity.",

      "Yoo suggests keeping an eye out for a strong concentration of a main ingredient. While the concentrations differ between products, some can go as high as 50% for a single ingredient, which usually yields quick results if you use them properly, says Yoo. They should also have simple formulas that have a short ingredient list and minimal additives, like colorants, preservatives or fragrance, to help prevent irritation.",
      "As with any skin care treatment, your purchase should be tailored to addressing your specific skin issues, like breakouts, dullness and dryness. If you have sensitive skin and are looking to try ampoules with stronger ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or retinol, choose a formula that has calming ingredients like ceramides or centella to help offset any irritation, says Yoo.",
      "Here are some ingredients to consider based on skin concerns and skin type:",
      "Sensitive, irritated skin: Look for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile and centella asiatica.Dry, dehydrated skin: Look for hydrators like ceramides, glycerin or hyaluronic acid.Dull skin or skin with hyperpigmentation: Consider brightening actives like niacinamide, vitamin C and plant extracts.Mature skin with fine lines: Consider firming ingredients like retinol and peptides.",

      "Ampoules are like a booster shot for your skin, so you should use them during periods of skin stress or flare-ups, says Yoo. \u201cIt\u2019s a booster step in your routine, not an everyday essential,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be helpful when your regular products aren\u2019t doing enough and you need something more intensive.\u201d She recommends cycling them into your routine after cleansing and before moisturizing, especially at night. However, while some ampoules are gentle enough to use daily, many are also strong formulas that are meant for short-term use, so be sure to check the label for best usage instructions, says Yoo.",
      "The difference between ampoules and serums are in their concentration, and which you should use depends on your skin goals, according to Yoo. Ampoules have a higher concentration of actives and often focus on one key ingredient, while serums are better for daily maintenance and usually combine multiple ingredients.",
      "\u201cAmpoules are more like short-term treatments,\u201d she says. Ampoules also tend to work faster than serums, but Yoo warns they can be more intense for sensitive skin.",

It\u2019s also easy to clean with a quick wipe down, and it has a flat bottom, so I can load all my essentials inside without the sides collapsing as I do so. There\u2019s little holes on the sides of the bag, which you can add attachments to, like beverage holders and charms (sold separately).",
      "Rubbermaid Brilliance Meal Prep Containers",
      "These food storage containers come in a pack of five, and each has a 2.85-cup capacity with two compartments. They\u2019re made from a clear stain- and odor-resistant material, so you can always see what\u2019s inside. The containers\u2019 lids have an airtight seal and secure latches, and if you flip the latches up, they act as vents \u2014 that means you can keep the lid on while microwaving to avoid splatters.",
      "Dyson Airwrap Origin",
      "The Dyson Airwrap simultaneously dries and styles your hair, letting you create curly, wavy and straight styles without causing heat damage, according to Dyson.

      "Netvue by Birdfy Pro Bird Feeder with Camera",

The app stores videos for up to 30 days so you can download and share them.",
      "ChomChom Pet Hair Remover and Reusable Lint Roller",
      "As someone with two cats and a dog, I swear by this pet hair remover. As you roll the tool\u2019s head along carpets and upholstered furniture, it grabs hair and stores it in an internal compartment. Then, when you\u2019re done cleaning, you press a button on the handle to open the compartment and throw the hair out.",

      "Most Prime Day deals last through the duration of the sale (it ends tonight, Jul. 11), but some are limited-time offers. For example, Lightning Deals are typically a few hours long \u2014 once a product sells out, the deal is over. Amazon is adding new deals each day of the sale, so make sure you\u2019re constantly browsing. It\u2019s also important to check out as soon as you see something you want since prices can go up any time.",
      "For the first time ever this year, Amazon Prime Day is four days long. It\u2019s typically a 48-hour event, so you have double the amount of time to shop this year.",
      "Prime Day 2025 ends tonight, Friday, Jul. 11 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time (2:59 a.m. ET on Saturday, Jul. 12).",
      "Amazon has not announced when the next Prime Day is. For the past few years, the retailer hosted its Prime Big Deal Days in October, which is nearly identical to July\u2019s sale with slightly different products on sale to focus more on the holiday shopping season.",
      "How I found the best Prime Day deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I also included products the NBC Select staff tested, including Wellness Award and Giftable Tech Award winners. I ran each deal through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in at least three months. All the products I recommend are 20% off or more, and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter for NBC Select who has covered Amazon Prime Day since 2020. In addition to writing about the best deals, I also wrote about what\u2019s included in a Prime membership, the history of Prime Day and what to buy and skip this year. Prior to Amazon\u2019s flagship sale, I previewed a list of deals from the retailer and sorted through them to find worthwhile sales you should know about.",

      "\u201cWhen she died a year ago, I didn\u2019t post anything. And yes, some people criticized that. To them I say: grief isn\u2019t a performance. It\u2019s personal. Let people grieve how they grieve,\u201d he added.",

      "\u201cWhen I first heard she was sick, we had nearly a decade more with her. And even then, most of the updates sounded less like \u2018Shannen\u2019s fighting cancer\u2019 and more like \u2018cancer picked the wrong woman,\u2019\u201d Ziering said. \u201cThat was her way \u2014 strong, defiant, take-no-prisoners tough.\u201d",
      "Ziering noted that its been \"hard\" being around the \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" cast without Doherty, especially since \"that kind of loss doesn\u2019t fade.\"",
      "\"It just rearranges the furniture in your heart,\" he said.",
      "Ziering then ended his lengthy statement by saying he still thinks of Doherty often.",
      "\"Rest easy, Shan,\" he said.",
      "Doherty played Brenda Walsh on \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210.\u201d Ziering\u2019s character, Steve Sanders, was friends with Brenda\u2019s brother.",
      "Doherty was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. Two years later, she went into remission and then in 2020, she announced her cancer had returned as stage 4.",
      "The cancer later metastasized to her bones and brain. In a June 2024 episode of her podcast, \u201cLet\u2019s Be Clear,\u201d she said earlier treatment protocols were no longer working for her.",
      "On July 13, 2024, her publicist, Leslie Sloane, announced that the \"Charmed\" star had died at 53, surrounded by her loved ones and her dog, Bowie."

      "Here's what to know about what's currently happening between Olandria and Nic.",
      "What happened between Olandria and Nic on 'Love Island USA'?",

But just as Nic was walking away from the villa, suitcase in tow, a car pulled up ahead of him. Who opened the door, beckoning Nic to get in? Olandria herself.",
      "The pair went on a romantic date where they discovered they had the chance to return to the main villa \u2014 as a couple. But both still had their respective partners on their minds. When Casa Amor came to a close, the two chose to keep their relationship platonic and planned to recouple with their old flames upon their return.",
      "When they returned from Casa Amor, Nic was able to re-couple with Cierra and later made things exclusive with her in Episode 25. However, Taylor chose to recouple with Casa Amor newcomer Clarke Carraway, leaving Olandria single once again.",

      "The show follows the complicated dynamic between the show\u2019s main character, Isabel \u201cBelly\u201d Conklin (Lola Tung), and her two romantic interests, brothers Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah Fisher (Gavin Casalegno).",
      "Like many famous fictional love triangles (think: \u201cTwilight,\u201d \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\" or \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d), the show has viewers sharply divided on which suitor Belly should select.",
      "In the books, she makes a clear choice, though it takes plenty of heartbreak and drama to get there.",
      "Below, we recapped what happens in Book 3, \"We'll Always Have Summer,\" but be warned: There are major spoilers for the ending of the book series ahead.",
      "What Happens in 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Book 3?",
      "At the end of Season 2 of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d Belly chooses Jeremiah, which aligns with the ending of the second book in the series, \"It\u2019s Not Summer Without You.\"",
      "The third book opens with a notable time jump. Two years after Belly and Jeremiah started dating \u2014\u00a0and Belly and Conrad seemingly closed the chapter on their love story \u2014\u00a0our heroine is now in college.",
      "At the beginning of \"We'll Always Have Summer,\" Belly is still with Jeremiah. In fact, the two attend the same university. The pair heads into the third year of their relationship, but not everything is as idyllic as it seems.",
      "(Last warning for book spoilers!)",
      "In a bombshell revelation, Jeremiah admits that he cheated on Belly. To reconcile their relationship, he immediately proposes, and Belly accepts.",
      "Eager for the wedding bells, Belly prepares to marry Jeremiah for a large portion of the book. While she tries on dresses and brainstorms venues, she attempts to get her hesitant family and friends on board. She ultimately is not very successful, especially after her loved ones learn that Jeremiah cheated.",
      "It may seem like Belly has found her happily ever after with Jeremiah.",
      "But over the summer, she and Conrad reconnect, and he finally confesses his feelings to her, revealing that he originally let her go because he didn't think he could love her the way she deserved amid his grief over his mom's death. He tells her not to marry Jeremiah, but she rebuffs him.",
      "The day of Belly and Jeremiah's wedding, Jeremiah receives a letter left for him by his mom. Only the envelopes were switched, and he reads the letter meant for Conrad, in which Susannah wrote that she only ever saw him in love once: with Belly.",
      "Jeremiah then goes to Belly and asks her if she loves Conrad. While she insists she's let him go, Jeremiah doesn't believe her, and they call off their wedding.",
      "The book finishes with an epilogue, in which Belly reads the letter Susannah left for her.",
      "Good news for \"Team Conrad\" fans, the couple ends up married. The epilogue reveals that after Belly and Jeremiah's breakup, she went on to study abroad and have plenty of adventures. She and Conrad reunite at her college graduation and shortly before her 24th birthday, they get married. Jeremiah attends the wedding.",
      "In the final sentences, Belly and Conrad run into the ocean and jump in the waves like they did as kids.",
      "Will Season 3 Follow the Book?",
      "With a few changes, the show\u2019s first two seasons kept large plot points consistent with the books. Regardless, some fans have strong opinions on what path the show will take for its final run.",
      "While fans can guess what might happen at the end of the series, ultimately, the only people who know what will happen are those who created it. So, what did they have to say about how the show will compare?",
      "\u201cThere are surprises. And there are things that aren\u2019t exactly like the books,\" Han confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, she reflected on how she approaches making changes when adapting the events of the book.",
      "\"I think about the story so much and so deeply that I take everything really seriously,\" Han says. \"I think it's all with the aim to tell, I think, the best story possible.\"",
      "While she can\u2019t reveal what will happen, she shares that \u201cwe considered so many different things.\"",
      "\"But ultimately I think whatever serves the story best is what I'm going to do,\" she says.",
      "Rain Spencer, who plays Belly\u2019s best friend, Taylor Jewel, tells TODAY.com that this season, she was \u201cvery surprised by a couple of things.\"",
      "As she read the script, she says she shared her reactions with Tung.",
      "\u201cLola and I would text each other and be like, \u2018Did you read this?\u2019\u201d Spencer says. \u201c'Is this real? Did you see that?\u2019\u201d",
      "Steven (Sean Kaufman) and Taylor's story represents one notable addition to the plot of the books. In Han's series, Taylor and Steven share a brief kiss in Book 1, but it doesn't progress to a romantic relationship.",
      "\"The writers, they came up to Rain and I and they were like, 'Lowkey, you're like, our two favorite characters to write for because your story is just so open. Everything is a possibility,'\" Kaufman tells TODAY.com.",
      "Spencer adds that the cast worked hard on the final product.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of really awesome surprises,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope everyone enjoys it.\u201d"

      "Tung says in that time, \"Belly has learned what it means to be in a committed, more long-term relationship.\" So committed in fact, they get engaged, the Season 3 trailer reveals.",
      "Belly's also found a stronger sense of self and \"comfortability\" in a space that isn't home or her favorite place, Cousins Beach.",
      "\"She has a new understanding of what being away from home and living on her own feels like,\" Tung says.",
      "\"I think she's just lived a lot more life and and naturally has learned from it and matured,\" she adds. \"I think there's an energetic shift. You can feel it when we enter the season.\"",
      "Belly and Taylor Are Still 'Ride or Die'",

      "At the end of Season 2, Belly and Conrad officially cut things off, after she kissed Jeremiah and he said they were just friends. But the season's ending hinted that they would lightly keep in touch \u2014 after all, they're connected by the Cousins Beach house they fought so hard to save. Conrad tells her he'll see her at Cousins for the Fourth of July that year.",
      "Now, four years later, it seems there's been something of an estrangement between Belly and Conrad. The Season 3 trailer hints that Conrad's been living in San Francisco and studying to practice medicine. (Since Conrad is older than both Belly and her brother Steven, he would have graduated from undergrad during the time jump.)",

      "Reflecting on the Cousins Beach core friend group, Kaufman says, \"Everybody has kind of gone their own way as they've gotten older.\"",
      "So the drama between the Belly, Jeremiah and Conrad love triangle \u2014 which in Season 2, caused a fight between the newly dating Taylor and Steven \u2014\u00a0\"no longer means as much to them.\"",
      "\"Steven has a real adult job to worry about. He can't be worried about who his sister's dating sometimes,\" he says. \"But I will say, there's a little bit of that still.\"",
      "\"He really tries to make an effort to be in Belly's life and to be supportive of her, like, no matter what,\" he adds.",

      "Now, around five years since Susannah's death, Season 3 will find Laurel on more \"steady ground,\" Chung tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"She has her feet under her now, and with her kids gone she has an opportunity to look around and see what's out there, and see what her life can be, and to look for new relationships,\" she adds.",
      "But that grief for Susannah will always be there, Chung says, and part of how she's honored that over the years is staying close to the Fisher boys.",
      "\"She wants to stay close with them, and she wants to check in on them to make sure they're OK,\" she says.",

      "Walking down a row of incubators in the neonatal unit of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, head of the facility's pediatric unit, shared each baby's story one by one.",
      "\"This baby is a full-term baby,\" he told NBC News' crew on the ground Thursday, gesturing at a tiny figure tucked into an incubator, wrapped in only his diaper and with an oxygen tube fixed to his nose with surgical tape.",
      "\"As you can see, he is depending on the mechanical ventilation,\" Al-Farra said. \"If the electricity was cut off ... this baby will not survive.\"",
      "His warning evokes memories of early on in the war, when a number of infants died at hospitals in northern Gaza after repeated warnings that a military assault in the area would end up being fatal for the babies.",
      "Nasser Hospital is just one of several facilities in Gaza facing \"imminent shutdown\" as fuel stocks in the enclave run out, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned Wednesday. The closure of vital units would most likely result in patients' deaths, including in the intensive care and neonatal units, it said.",
      "OCHA added that the \"total ban on fuel entry\" enforced by Israel for around 130 days was to blame for the shortages, which it said has also severely impacted water, sanitation and hygiene services.",
      "While Israel in May lifted a blockade that prevented the entry of food, medical supplies and other vital items, it has only allowed in a limited amount of aid, including \"basic\" food supplies.",

      "Mencer did not answer the question as to whether more fuel would be allowed to reach hospitals in Gaza in the near future.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dr. Mohammad Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News that the facility only had around 3,000 liters (790 gallons) of diesel left. He said it needed 4,500 liters (1,190 gallons) daily to operate all departments effectively. Already, he said, the hospital had turned off electricity for some departments, funneling power to only the most vital units.",
      "\"The situation is very catastrophic because the electricity will abruptly go off within 24 hours,\" Saqer said. \"This means that a lot of patients, especially in the ICU in addition to other departments, are subject to inevitable death.\"",
      "Hospitals across the enclave have struggled to operate throughout the war, after being hit hard in Israel's offensive. Of the territory's 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 18 are providing partial services and 18 are not working at all, according to World Health Organization data last updated Monday.",
      "Saqer, meanwhile, called on the international community to step in and help get fuel to Gaza's hospitals in order to \"save the lives of the children.\"",
      "His call came as the European Union foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a post on X on Thursday that E.U. officials had reached a new deal with Israel to allow much-needed food and fuel into the enclave.",

What is the guilt of this child to die?\u201d They were starving and just trying to get formula at the clinic, she said.",
      "According to UNICEF, which issued a statement on the strike Thursday, the 1-year-old who was killed had just spoken his first word hours earlier. His mother was injured in the blast and now lies in a hospital bed, clutching her dead baby's shoe.",
      "\u201cNo parent should have to face such tragedy,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis is the cruel reality confronting many in Gaza today after months of insufficient aid being allowed into the territory, and parties to the conflict failing to uphold basic responsibilities to protect civilians.\u201d",
      "She called on Israel to \u201curgently review its rules of engagement to ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law, notably the protection of civilians, including children.\u201d",
      "According to the local Health Ministry, 82 people were confirmed to have been killed in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to over 57,700 since October 2023, with more than 130,000 injured. More than 50,000 of those killed and injured have been children, Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and Africa, said in May.",
      "Dua al-Hazarin, a local journalist who captured the immediate aftermath of Thursday's strike on video, told NBC News that she had been on her way to an assignment when the attack \"happened right in front of me.\"",
      "\"Shrapnel was flying. People were torn apart and the dust from the missile filled the entire area,\" she said.",
      "Later outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, men prayed over shrouded bodies and, in a scene now familiar, if no less heartbreaking after 20 months of war, one of them picked up a tiny white bundle to carry the child to the cemetery."

      "When Brad Squires and the then-Anita Moran wrote a tender account of their picnic date, stuffed it into the bottle of wine they'd just emptied and tossed it into the waves below, they never dreamed someone would actually read it, let alone 13 years later and almost 2,000 miles away.",
      "Thrown into the water on Newfoundland\u2019s Bell Island, the bottle and its paper cargo traveled on wild Atlantic seas for more than 4,600 days, adrift during 11 iterations of iPhone, two Donald Trump elections and a global pandemic that came and went.",
      "That epic journey took it to the west coast of Ireland, where it was discovered this week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of pure joy,\u201d said Martha Farrell, chair of the Maharees Conservation Association, whose members found the bottle Monday. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s the impossibility and resilience of that glass bottle finding our beach all those years later \u2014 but also the resilience of the couple.\u201d",
      "Using the power of social media, its Irish finders tracked down couple who are now married with three kids.",
      "The note was \u201conly two or three lines but it captures their moment,\u201d Farrell told NBC News. \u201cIt was like a little secret between themselves \u2014 but now it has brought so much joy to so many people.\u201d",
      "When Brad Squires, now 40, hurled the bottle off the high cliffs of Bell Island, the couple \"thought it wasn't even going to make it to the water, let alone bypass all the rocks and make it across the ocean and and be found,\" Anita Squires, now 35, told NBC News. \"For all the stars to align, for all those things to happen, it seems like an impossible feat for that little bottle, but it was pretty resilient.\"",
      "Back then, the couple had been dating for a year and were in a long-distance relationship: he a police officer in British Columbia and she a trainee nurse in Newfoundland.",
      "\u201cToday we enjoyed dinner, this bottle of wine and each other on the edge of the island,\u201d she wrote in the message. \u201cIf you find this, please call us,\u201d she added, providing a number but never imagining somebody actually would.",
      "They had shared a precious picnic together on the tiny Bell Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from St. John's. \"I gave it everything I had,\" Brad Squires said of his attempt to launch the bottled missive into the waves below.",
      "They soon forgot about it. They got married in 2016, settling  down in Newfoundland. They have three children, Allie, 19, Gabe, 16, and Harrison, 5.",
      "In Scraggane Bay on Ireland's picturesque Dingle Peninsula, the bottle was found Monday by another couple, Kate and Jon Gay, members of the local charity Maharees Conservation Association, who were doing a beach cleanup.",
      "They kept it until the association's meeting later that night, smashing it open, toasting the unknown writers but failing to get an answer from the number provided. So Farrell posted an appeal on Facebook thinking it might yield an answer in weeks or months. One hour later, Anita Squires had got in touch to say she was the note's author.",
      "\"It was phenomenal,\" Farrell said.",
      "There is a doubly serendipitous side to this story, too.",
      "The Maharees, where the bottle was found, is a 3-mile isthmus of sand that has been battered and eroded by extreme weather and sea-level rises fueled by climate change. So too have parts of Newfoundland.",
      "The grassroots Maharees Conservation Association wants to use this story to link up with people in Newfoundland experiencing the same issues. And the author of the letter in the bottle is going to connect them.",
      "\"They have a soft coastline, they have a sand dune system, and they are also vulnerable to sea level rises,\" Farrell said. \"It's a somber enough affair when you're thinking: How can we actually prepare ourselves for what's to come? So to have this little moment of pure joy in the middle of that, it was very welcome.\"",
      "Anita Squires says that her \"love story is cute, but the work they are doing is so important,\" referring to the conservation group's attempts to protect and adapt their  coastlines to the climate crisis. So, linking these campaigners is \"the beautiful thing at the end of the story.\""

      "Most concerning, Liu added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An elite Chinese cyberspy group hacked at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year, the Department of Defense has found.",
      "The hackers, already responsible for one of the most expansive cyberespionage campaigns against the U.S. to date, are alleged to have burrowed even further than previously known, and may have obtained sensitive military or law enforcement information. Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December 2024. The memo did not specify which state was affected.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",
      "The Department of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A National Guard Bureau spokesperson confirmed the compromise but declined to share details.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",
      "\u201cCyberattacks are a common threat faced by all countries, China included,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. \u201chas been unable to produce conclusive and reliable evidence that the \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 is linked to the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing turn against his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has inspired hopes in Ukraine and among its supporters that he is starting to believe what they\u2019ve been telling him all along: Moscow is the antagonist and the only way to stop it is with cash and military equipment.",
      "But while Monday\u2019s apparent U-turn was dramatic, other Ukraine supporters, former officials and other foreign policy experts are wary at least and deeply skeptical at worst.",
      "\u201cThe question that Europeans and Ukrainians are asking,\u201d according to Ivo Daalder, former United States ambassador to NATO, is \u201chow real is this change? And how lasting is this change? And what does it really mean in terms of American policy toward the region?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that the Trump administration has moved the goal posts,\u201d having briefly cut off aid to Ukraine in February, he said. \u201cSo there are a lot of questions here.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But on  Monday in the Oval Office, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, he said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the Kremlin and that the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "Alongside that, if Putin does not agree to a peace deal in 50 days, Trump said, he will slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods. That lag time has been criticized across Europe, with officials and experts asking why Trump is giving additional time to an autocrat who has hardly wavered in his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "The anxiety is fueled further by the widespread perception in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is a president who makes decisions on a whim and is prone to changing them.",
      "Trump himself hinted at this propensity to change his mind quickly. He recalled going home one night and telling first lady Melania Trump, \u201c\u2018I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.\u2019\u201d To which she responded, \u201c\u2018Oh, really, another city was just hit\u2019\u201d in Ukraine by Russia\u2019s missiles.",
      "The exact details of Trump\u2019s new direction are as yet unclear.",
      "He said that the shopping list included Patriot missiles, the state-of-the-art American defensive system that Ukraine says it desperately needs to fend off Russia\u2019s nearly nightly aerial assaults.",
      "European NATO allies were going to buy \u201cbillions of dollars worth of military equipment\u201d from the U.S. \u201cand that\u2019s going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine, he added.",
      "The Patriot missiles could arrive in Ukraine \u201cvery soon \u2014 within days, actually,\u201d expedited by European nations giving their existing weapons to Ukraine and replacing them with the new systems delivered by the U.S., he said.",
      "\u201cThis is really big,\u201d said Rutte, a man who often heaps praise on Trump. \u201cIt will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc.\u201d He added, \u201cif I\u2019m Ukraine, I think this is really great news.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has clashed several times with Trump and his team, posted on X thanking the president \u201cfor the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\u201d",
      "Other endorsements came with caveats.",
      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",
      "However she suggested that waiting almost two months to impose tariffs was too long: \u201cFifty days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians every day.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a view also held by Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey, that supports Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless significant pressure is applied on Putin and the Russian economy immediately, more innocent civilians will die.\u201d",
      "Russian officials mixed grave condemnation with mockery.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cvery serious\u201d because it was \u201caddressed personally to President Putin.\u201d Whereas former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called it a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d about which \u201cRussia didn\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "A senior Kremlin official told NBC News that Putin may not rush to respond. \u201cWe need to analyze the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take some time.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the optimism of Ukraine\u2019s supporters will be dictated by what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s weapons deal \u2014 and whether he sticks with his renewed direction of thinking on the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe need to be a bit cautious as to whether this is a sea change in Trump\u2019s opinion or if it\u2019s just another part of a whiplash effect as he veers backwards and forwards,\u201d Matthew Savill, , director of military sciences at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, told NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News. \u201cHis overriding goal is to get credit for ending the fighting.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (July 15, 2025, 2:25 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated where the nonprofit Hope for Ukraine is based. It is in Roseland, New Jersey, not Portland, Oregon."

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Coldiretti, an association that represents European agricultural companies, said American consumers would likely face shortages or see price hikes for imported wine, cheese and pastas.",
      "And German industry association BDI called the escalation \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d warning that it threatened jobs and investment worldwide. Germany is the top E.U. exporter to the U.S.",
      "Cars and other vehicles produced in the E.U. could also face increased prices. \"The costs for our companies have already reached the billions\u2014and with each passing day, the total continues to grow,\" the German auto trade group VDA told NBC News in a statement Monday.",
      "Those statements come after Trump sent a letter to the E.U. (and a separate one to Mexico) on Saturday threatening a blanket 30% tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. starting Aug. 1, an indication that ongoing trade negotiations have failed. After initially backing down from his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and promising trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has steadily returned to his trade war posture, sending letters to countries around the world with ultimatums and tariff rates from 20% to 40%.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key source of U.S. food and wine exports, said Saturday he strongly disapproved of the 30% tariff and urged the E.U. to speed up \u201cthe preparation of credible countermeasures.\u201d He said trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe \u201cowe each other\u201d respect.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. was the top destination for E.U. exports. The top exported products from the E.U. to the U.S. last year were medical and pharmaceutical products, medicines, motor vehicles and machinery, according to Eurostat.",
      "Trump has threatened sector-specific tariffs on pharmaceutical products, although it\u2019s not clear when those might be unveiled.",
      "Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Harris, one of the first E.U. leaders to react to Trump\u2019s Saturday letter, said \u201cthere is no necessity to escalate the situation.\u201d Harris said he planned to meet with the U.S. ambassador to Ireland on Monday to discuss the situation.",
      "Ireland is the top source of U.S. pharma imports from the E.U., and serves as the European headquarters of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta.",
      "Speaking in Brussels on Monday after a meeting of E.U. trade ministers, the European Commission\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said the 30% tariff \u201cis absolutely unacceptable. That is the level which is absolutely prohibitive to any trade.\u201d",
      "Last year, the total value of E.U.-U.S. trade amounted to nearly $2 trillion.",
      "Some are still expressing hope for a deal.",
      "\u201cThe clear impression was that we were very, very close in agreement in principle,\u201d Denmark\u2019s foreign minister said Monday after the trade ministers meeting. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible due to this presidential letter, but it is still our major vision that we should reach an agreement, but we also want to send signal that it must be a fair deal for everybody.\u201d",
      "For its part, the E.U. has delayed any countermeasures \u2014 or retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u2014 but it currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby.",
      "Some of that retaliation targets goods and produce from politically sensitive U.S. states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana or bourbon from Kentucky. Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",

Between 2005 and 2023, more than 93% of all investigations were closed without an indictment and only 3% of investigations led to a conviction, according to a report by the organization.",
      "\u201cThe low conviction rate sends the message that the law enforcement system, in its entirety, does not consider settler violence to be a serious issue, contributing to the perpetrators\u2019 sense of immunity,\u201d the report said.",
      "Since October 2023, 961 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to a database maintained by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a sharp rise from previous years.",
      "CAIR-Florida, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nationwide Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned Israeli settlers, \u201cbacked and enabled by the Israeli government,\u201d for Musallet\u2019s death, and called on President Donald Trump to \u201cput America first.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEvery other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians.\u201d",
      "In April, 14-year-old American Amer Rabee was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. His family said he was picking almonds, the IDF said he was throwing rocks. In September 2024, Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by an Israeli soldier during a demonstration against West Bank settlements.",
      "American citizens Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour and Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, both 17, were killed by Israeli fire in separate incidents in February and January 2024."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened a significant tariff hike on the European Union and Mexico, two of the largest U.S. trade partners.",
      "In separate letters published on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote that each country will face a blanket tariff rate of 30% on all goods exported to the U.S. starting Aug. 1.",
      "Trump threatened even higher tariffs if either the E.U. or Mexico retaliate against his new levy.",
      "Writing to Mexico's president, Trump also focused on border security, saying that \"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough.\"",
      "\"Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\" he added.",
      "Trump has spent the past week bringing his trade war back to a roaring boil. He kicked it off by issuing dozens of letters announcing unilateral tariffs, then said he planned to impose 50% duties on copper goods, sending prices of the raw metal to all-time highs. Late Thursday, he announced he would apply a blanket tariff of up to 20% on all imports, as well as a 35% tariff on some, and perhaps all, Canadian imports starting next month.",
      "The letters come as the many trade deals that Trump administration officials had said would be signed have failed to materialize, leaving Trump with little to show for weeks of negotiations.",
      "While Mexico was spared from Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff rollout on April 2, the 30% rate for the E.U. is 10 percentage points higher than what the president said he would apply to America's largest trading partner in April but lower than his mid-May threat of 50%.",
      "The 27-member European Union is the United States\u2019 largest trading partner \u2014 its $605 billion worth of imports into the U.S. surpassing Mexico, Canada and even China. The most valuable category was drugs and pharmaceuticals, followed by autos and aircraft and other heavy machinery. Trump has already threatened to impose a 200% tariff on any drugs imported into the U.S., though it would not be applied for at least 18 months.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to Trump's letter, saying in a statement that \"few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices.\"",
      "But von der Leyen said she \"will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests,\" including retaliatory tariffs \"if required.\"",
      "Mexico meanwhile is another one of the United States' most important trading partners, with more than $505 billion worth of goods imported by American consumers and companies in 2024.",
      "Mexico made up 69% of U.S. vegetable imports and 51% of U.S. fresh fruit imports in recent years, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. With short shelf lives, produce could see price hikes faster than other goods.",
      "Markets had spent most of the week brushing off the earlier escalations, leaving stocks largely at the record highs they\u2019d regained thanks largely to recent weeks\u2019 trade-war lull. Trump himself touted the gains in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "But on Friday, major indexes closed lower on the heels of Trump vowing to hit Brazil, a key source of commodities like coffee and orange juice, with a 50% tariff. Trump said the tariff was so high because of \"unsustainable Trade Deficits\" even though the U.S. currently runs at a surplus in its trade with Brazil.",
      "Trump also said \"the way Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro ... is an international disgrace.\"",
      "In the case of the E.U., the bloc currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby that can be quickly implemented. Some of those retaliatory duties target goods made in Republican-represented states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana and bourbon from Kentucky, which is represented in the House and Senate by a nearly all-Republican delegation.",
      "Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "Analysts say the new tariff onslaught adds further risk to an inflation outlook that has already been teetering on edge.",
      "\u201cHigher tariffs going into effect in August also could mean that inflationary effects come through later this year or even into next year, extending the timeline on higher inflation,\u201d analysts with Citi wrote in a note to clients published Friday.",
      "The European Commission, the executive arm of the E.U., has been furiously negotiating toward an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d in order to avoid the outcome of getting hit with one of Trump\u2019s tariff letters.",
      "Speaking on Wednesday before the European Parliament, the E.U.\u2019s top trade official, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said negotiations were happening \u201cevery single day\u201d between the two sides. \u201cCrucially, while other nations faced increased tariffs from United States, the result of the letters that President Trump sent out on Monday, our negotiations have spared the E.U. from facing higher tariffs.\u201d",
      "However, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d noted that the U.S. had \u201cdiffering perspectives\u201d about the international trading relationship.",
      "In the hour leading up to Trump\u2019s announcement, an E.U. official said that while the bloc was \u201cfully locked and loaded to conclude an agreement in principle,\u201d it didn\u2019t \u201chave any update to indicate that that is going to happen imminently.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russia launched more aerial attacks on Ukraine in June than in any other month of the war so far, causing the highest number of civilians killed or wounded since the conflict broke out more than three years ago, according to a tally by the United Nations and independent researchers.",
      "The onslaught of armed drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles raining down on Ukrainian towns and cities has underscored Russia\u2019s determination to press on with its war against Ukraine despite President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to halt the bloodshed.",
      "The Russian aerial attacks have been steadily increasing since July 2024, with the number of strikes exceeding 2,500 in each of the first six months of this year, according to the nonprofit Institute for the Study of War, which cited figures from Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry.",
      "The difference over the same period last year is stark.",
      "Between January and June, Russian drone and missile attacks numbered 23,245, a roughly 605 % increase compared to the same period last year when there were 3,300, according to the Washington-based institute.",
      "The expansion was driven by a massive increase in drone assaults, which jumped from 2,264 in the first half of 2024 to 22,495 in the first half of 2025, according to the tally.",
      "As a result of those aerial attacks, the toll of civilians killed and wounded increased to 6,719, up about 53% from the same period in 2024, according to U.N. monitors. The civilian toll included 1,091 deaths and 5,628 wounded.",
      "\u201cCivilians across Ukraine are facing levels of suffering we have not seen in over three years,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said in a statement. \u201cThe surge in long-range missile and drone strikes across the country has brought even more death and destruction to civilians far away from the frontline.\u201d",
      "June marked the highest monthly civilian casualty toll in three years, with 232 killed and 1,343 wounded, according to the United Nations.",
      "In the month of June, Russian forces fired 5,681 drones and missiles on Ukraine \u2013 the highest number since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The aerial assault included 5,438 drones and 243 missiles, according to the Institute for the Study of War.",
      "Russia has kept up the tempo of drone and missile attacks in July, forcing Ukrainians in cities to seek shelter underground in subway stations. Smoke rose over Kyiv on Wednesday and Thursday night from Russian drone and missile strikes that ignited fires and destroyed apartment buildings, NBC News and The Associated Press reported from the capital.",
      "On Wednesday night, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones on Ukraine, along with missiles. On Thursday night, 397 Iranian-designed Shahed and decoy drones were launched against Kyiv and other regions, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "With Russian troops unable to score a breakthrough on the ground despite a significant manpower advantage, Moscow has stepped up its missile and drone attacks on the country\u2019s cities to try to overwhelm air defenses, undermine the resolve of the government in Kyiv before any peace talks, and break the will of the wider population, current and former Western diplomats say.",
      "\u201cThese attacks are on civilian targets, so it\u2019s an attempt to demoralize Ukrainians, to convince Ukrainians that they can\u2019t win,\u201d said William Taylor, a former career U.S. diplomat who served in Kyiv.",
      "Christina Harward, a Russian analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said previous attempts by Russia to damage morale have failed. The air attacks also indicated Russia\u2019s weapons production and stockpiles had increased, especially long-range drones, Harward said.",
      "\u201cRussia may also be trying to distract from the battlefield, where Russian gains on the front are still relatively slow and are coming at huge personnel costs,\u201d she said.",
      "Before he took office in January, Trump had pledged to end the war in \u201ca day.\u201d He initially suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government were the main obstacle to bringing an end to the conflict, which began with Russia\u2019s invasion of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But in recent days, Trump\u2019s tone has shifted, with the president expressing impatience and frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for offering what he called \u201cmeaningless\u201d moves toward peace."

    "story": [
      "Dozens of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants began handing over weapons in a ceremony in a cave in northern Iraq on Friday, officials said, marking a symbolic but significant step toward ending a decades-long insurgency against Turkey.",
      "Helicopters hovered above the mountain where the disarmament process got underway, with dozens of Iraqi Kurdish security forces surrounding the area, a Reuters witness said.",
      "The PKK, locked in conflict with the Turkish state and outlawed since 1984, decided in May to disband, disarm and end its separatist struggle after a public call to do so from its long-imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan.",
      "After a series of failed peace efforts, the new initiative could pave the way for Ankara to end an insurgency that has killed over 40,000 people, burdened the economy and wrought deep social and political divisions in Turkey and the wider region.",
      "The ceremony was held inside the Jasana cave in the town of Dukan, 37 miles northwest of Sulaymaniyah in the Kurdistan region of Iraq\u2018s north, according to an Iraqi security official and another regional government official.",
      "Around 40 PKK militants and one commander were to hand over their weapons, people familiar with the plan said. It was unclear when further handovers would take place.",
      "The PKK has been based in northern Iraq after being pushed well beyond Turkey\u2019s southeastern frontier in recent years. Turkey\u2019s military has regularly carried out operations and strikes on PKK bases in the region and established several military outposts there.",
      "No footage of the ceremony has been made available yet, but Turkish broadcasters have been showing the crowds gathered near Sulaymaniyah and landscapes of the mountainous region as part of their coverage of what they said was a historic moment.",
      "The arms are to be destroyed later in another ceremony attended by Turkish and Iraqi intelligence figures, officials of Iraq\u2018s Kurdistan regional government, and senior members of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish DEM party \u2014 which also played a key role in facilitating the PKK\u2019s disarmament decision.",
      "The PKK, DEM and Ocalan have all called on Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government to address Kurdish demands for more rights in regions where Kurds form a majority, particularly the southeast where the insurgency was concentrated.",
      "In a rare online video published on Wednesday, Ocalan also urged Turkey\u2019s parliament to set up a commission to oversee disarmament and manage the broader peace process.",
      "Ankara has taken steps toward forming the commission, while the DEM and Ocalan have said that legal assurances and certain mechanisms were needed to smooth the PKK\u2019s transition into democratic politics.",
      "Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, said the disarmament process should not be allowed to drag on longer than a few months to avoid it becoming subject to provocations.",
      "Erdogan has said the disarmament will enable the rebuilding of Turkey\u2019s southeast.",
      "Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has said Turkey spent nearly $1.8 trillion over the past five decades combating terrorism, endorsing the peace steps as an economic boon.",
      "The end of NATO member Turkey\u2019s conflict with the PKK could have consequences across the region, including in neighboring Syria where the United States is allied with Syrian Kurdish forces that Ankara deems a PKK offshoot.",
      "Washington and Ankara want those Kurds to quickly integrate with Syria\u2019s security structure, which has been undergoing reconfiguration since the fall in December of autocratic President Bashar al-Assad. PKK disarmament could add to this pressure, analysts say."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried beneath Iran\u2019s Isfahan facility by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand, a senior Israeli government official said in Washington on Wednesday night. But it is effectively unreachable, the official said, because Israel is watching, and if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the material, it will not hesitate to conduct new strikes.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s conclusion regarding the uranium at Isfahan, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump has said many times, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The entire world is safer thanks to his decisive leadership.\u201d",
      "In a lengthy briefing with reporters Wednesday night, the senior Israeli government official said Israel decided to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities because of intelligence it had that Tehran had begun rapidly and secretly proceeding to weaponize its enriched uranium after Israel\u2019s targeted assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September.",
      "The official said that Israel had shared the intelligence with President Donald Trump but was preparing to strike with or without a green light or participation from the United States and that American support was not a condition for Israel\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The official would not specify the source of the intelligence.",
      "Iran denies that it wants to build a nuclear weapon. In an interview with NBC News a day before the U.S. strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked about National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s having testified before Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccontinues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,\u201d the Israeli official dismissed the question, viewing the assessment as not serious.",
      "According to the official, Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been set back up to two years.",
      "An initial assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency leaked late last month found that the U.S. strikes on Isfahan and two other sites may have set back the program only several months.",
      "The question of how damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u2014 along with how much its timeline toward building a nuclear weapon should it ever decide to do so was delayed \u2014 has been a politically charged one. Trump and his administration have denounced the leak of the DIA assessment and the outlets that first reported it.",
      "The day after the initial DIA assessment was first reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that \u201ca body of credible intelligence\u201d indicated the program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis includes new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\u201d he said."
