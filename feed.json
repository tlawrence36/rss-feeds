      "A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault has told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set",
      "PARIS -- A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris on Wednesday that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d). He denies any sexual assault.",
      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",
      "In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: \u201cI said no, I was scared.\"",
      "She also described telling Depardieu \u201cno\u201d during a third similar incident.",
      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- In West Philadelphia where he was born and raised, now there\u2019s a street called Will Smith Way.",
      "Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker and city leaders honored the Oscar and Grammy winner on Wednesday, renaming a street next to Smith's old high school.",
      "\u201cPhilly, I love you. I am yours. You are mine,\u201d Smith said at a ceremony along a section of 59th Street that now bears his name.",
      "He reminisced about learning the values of hard work and education from his mother and father before hitting it big as an actor and rapper.",
      "\u201cNobody gets an easy ride,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of the things these streets of Philadelphia taught me: that there's nothing wrong with a hard day's work.\u201d",
      "Among those who came out to see him was a former teacher who was the first to call him \u201cPrince Charming\u201d \u2014 a nickname he changed up a bit for the 1990s TV show \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d in which Smith played a teenager from Philadelphia who goes to live with relatives in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThe name `The Fresh Prince' was coined in that building,\" Smith said, pointing back at Overbrook High School. \u201cI added the \u2018fresh\u2019 because it was hip-hop slang.\"",

      "With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, G\u00e9rard Depardieu reigned over cinema for half a century",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",

      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",

      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs.

      "ALBUQUERQE, N.M. -- Authorities have released body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February.",
      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home. With no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn\u2019t see how that could have been the case.",
      "\u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d one of the workers said.",
      "Authorities soon determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, further fueling a mystery that captured the public\u2019s attention.",
      "It was solved about a week later when medical investigators confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 took the life of his wife.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office released only some of the footage from the investigation.",
      "A New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home. Hackman\u2019s estate had filed the petition to withhold images, citing the need to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment.",
      "Workers who had maintained the property talked to investigators about respecting Hackman and Arawaka\u2019s privacy. One worker described Arawaka as a private person.",
      "The body camera footage also shows brief sightings of one of the couple\u2019s dogs running in the wooded hills on their property on the edge of Santa Fe. A man who identified himself to officers as a dog trainer who cared for the couple\u2019s pet dogs said the couple were \u201cnuts\u201d about their dogs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s toys everywhere around the property,\u201d he said.",
      "In a separate video, Arakawa\u2019s hairdresser told investigators that his client took the dogs with her everywhere and that the smallest one would often hang out inside the salon with them during her visits.",
      "That dog was found inside a crate, not far from Arakawa\u2019s body. A report obtained by The Associated Press from the state Department of Agriculture\u2019s veterinary lab states the dog likely died from dehydration and starvation.",

      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",
      "The ceremony will be streamed on Netflix on May 4.",

      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

      "Guillod, a talent manager and producer whose credits include 2017's \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d and 2020's \u201cExtraction,\u201d was originally arrested in 2020 and charged with rape and sexual assault involving six women between 2014 and 2020 in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",

      "Yella Beezy, 33, whose real name is Markies Conway, was indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on Tuesday on a charge of capital murder while remuneration. The indictment accuses Conway of hiring a man named Kewon White to murder Mo3, whose real name was Melvin Noble.",

      "Two hundred years have passed since the invention of braille, the tactile writing system that has transformed the lives of many blind and partially sighted people by offering a path to literacy and independence.",
      "\u201cBraille helped me live my life,\" said Ndiaye, a social worker in Mali who lost his eyesight as a child. \u201cBefore, people asked themselves the question: Here is someone who can\u2019t see, how will he make it? How will he integrate into society?\u201d",
      "The West African country, with a population of over 20 million people, has long struggled to integrate blind and partially sighted people. According to eye care charity Sightsavers, around 170,000 people in Mali are thought to be blind.",
      "The 47-year-old Ndiaye was fortunate to attend the institute for the blind in Mali, where he learned to write in braille, and told himself: \u201cReally, everything that others do, I can do too.\u201d He later attended university.",
      "He said braille has allowed him to develop his main passion, playing the guitar, which also emphasizes the importance of touch.",
      "\u201cEach pressure on the strings, each movement of the finger on the neck, becomes a living note, loaded with meaning,\" Ndiaye said.",
      "The guitar is an integral part of Mali's griot tradition, the cultural practice of storytelling through music. Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora. Local artists such as Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 have fused Malian melodies with elements of the blues, creating a soulful, hypnotic sound that has gained international acclaim.",
      "Iconic Malian musical duo Amadou and Mariam awakened Ndiaye's passion for the instrument when he was a boy.",

      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "The new study, supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, looked at a test called CA-125. The test measures a tumor marker in the blood, and doctors use it to determine if a woman with a suspicious lump should be referred to a cancer specialist.",
      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",
      "Initial studies of the test, published in the 1980s, didn\u2019t record people\u2019s races but were in mostly white populations.",
      "The test isn't perfect for white women either, said lead author Dr. Anna Jo Smith of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.",
      "\u201cBut if we have worse performance in certain groups, then we may be further contributing to disparities in referral, disparities in treatment, and ultimately we may be contributing to the lower survival in Black women with ovarian cancer,\" Smith said.",
      "The researchers analyzed data from more than 200,000 women with ovarian cancer from 2004 through 2020 who'd had a CA-125 blood test.",
      "Black and Native American patients were 23% less likely to have an elevated CA-125 level at ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with white patients, suggesting the current thresholds are set too high.",
      "The researchers also found that patients with false negative results started chemotherapy on average nine days later than patients with elevated levels. That could make a difference for some patients, Smith said.",
      "Last week, Smith and her colleagues presented work at a Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting proposing a new lower threshold for the blood test that would work better across all populations. The work could lead to changes in guidelines.",

      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",

      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of fun to do,\u201d Friday said on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone could become the second country in West Africa to decriminalize abortion",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- When she got pregnant at 16, Fatou Esther Jusu was terrified that it would derail her future.",
      "Abortion is illegal in Sierra Leone. Fearing judgment from her family, she took friends\u2019 advice and bought misoprostol, a drug whose uses include abortion, from a local pharmacy. It didn't work. Desperate, she tried again and miscarried.",
      "\u201cI went to the toilet\u2026 and the baby came out,\u201d she said. She fainted and was taken to a hospital, where she pleaded with doctors not to tell her parents.",
      "Now 21, Jusu considers herself lucky. One friend died after taking an expired version of the medication.",
      "With those experiences in mind, the nursing student is mobilizing others in support of a bill that would decriminalize abortion in the West African country.",
      "\u201cEven though I made a mistake, this mistake is saving other people,\u201d Jusu said.",
      "Sierra Leone could become the second country in West Africa to decriminalize abortion, which health workers say would significantly improve the safety of pregnant women, decrease the number of preventable deaths and bring an end to the current colonial-era law.",
      "Tens of thousands of women and girls attempt to self-terminate their pregnancies every year in Sierra Leone, where abortion is illegal in all circumstances.",
      "Supporters of the bill say unsafe abortions account for around 10% of maternal deaths. Healthcare workers are known to perform terminating procedures when the situation is \u201cincompatible with life\u201d of the woman, usually in the case of \u201cincomplete\u201d abortions. Because abortion is illegal, they cite other reasons for the termination.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s President Julius Maada Bio pointedly introduced the Safe Motherhood Bill after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, stripping away women's constitutional protections for abortion.",
      "\u201cAt a time when sexual and reproductive health rights for women are either being overturned or threatened, we are proud that Sierra Leone can once again lead with progressive reforms,\u201d Bio said.",
      "If approved, the bill would have been West Africa's most progressive legislation on abortion, allowing the procedure for up to 14 weeks.",
      "But Sierra Leone since then has been torn apart by debate. Following opposition from religious leaders, the bill has been amended and now limits abortion to cases of life-threatening risk, fatal fetal abnormalities, rape or incest.",
      "The government says it expects a vote in parliament in the coming weeks. It is not clear whether it will be approved.",
      "An estimated 90,000 abortions are performed annually in Sierra Leone, a country of more than 8 million people, according to research by the African Population and Health Research Center. About 10% of the country's maternal deaths \u2014 affecting 717 of every 100,000 births \u2014 are due to unsafe abortions, the center said.",
      "Health workers say the true number is likely much higher.",
      "Due to cost and stigma, many women and girls resort to unsafe methods like expired medication, laundry detergent, hangers or sharp instruments.",
      "On a recent morning at a clinic run by the MSI Sierra Leone nonprofit, dozens of women and girls waited nervously for consultations with nurse Hawanatu Samura.",
      "MSI offers \u201cpost-abortion care,\u201d including terminations in cases of \u201cincomplete\u201d miscarriage, often when people have tried and failed abortions themselves. The nonprofit is the largest individual service provider of family planning services in the country.",
      "If patients want an abortion, \u201cthey go to any length,\u201d Samura said. She often sees damage caused by unsterilized instruments, leading to severe hemorrhages, especially in underage girls.",
      "Over 20% of girls between 15 and 19 in Sierra Leone get pregnant, according to the U.N. Population Fund, one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the world.",
      "Samura said a 13-year-old \u2014 already mother to a 10-month-old \u2014 recently arrived with severe pain after secretly taking unidentified pills to try to abort her pregnancy.",
      "\u201cIn Sierra Leone, people are afraid of the stigma \u2026 so they would prefer to die silently,\u201d she said. The patient did not understand her body, Samura said, and her dead fetus resulted in dangerous septicemia.",
      "The clinic has at least one such case a month, the nurse said.",
      "Many women and girls who have had abortions fear speaking out, and the push for the bill in Sierra Leone has been led by women\u2019s rights groups and medical professionals.",
      "\u201cIf you aren\u2019t listening to your doctors, then who are you listening to?\u201d said lawyer and advocate Nicky Spencer-Coker. She has fought for reproductive rights alongside a coalition of women\u2019s rights organisations since 2015.",
      "At the time, parliament unanimously passed a first version of a bill allowing abortions for up to 12 weeks. But then-President Ernest Bai Koroma blocked the bill amid pressure from anti-abortion and religious groups.",
      "Some Muslim and Christian leaders have denounced the current bill as \u201cungodly\u201d and \u201chellish.\u201d Archbishop Edward Tamba Charles, head of the country's Inter-Religious Council, said it contradicts citizens' \u201creligious values and sensibilities.\u201d",
      "Sierra Leone's current president has faced opposition from his own party members, including lawmaker Rebecca Yei Kamara.",
      "\u201cIn our communities, children don\u2019t get pregnant \u2026 they talk to them, they teach them how to grow up into womanhood,\u201d she said, and accused supporters of the bill of exaggerating the country's abortion statistics.",
      "Government officials have called the bill a necessary response to the reality of high numbers of deaths among pregnant women.",
      "\u201cThe number of girls that die every year \u2026 that\u2019s the demonstration of people\u2019s will,\u201d Chernor Bah, the information minister, told The Associated Press.",
      "Officials also say the bill is needed to strengthen gender reforms in Sierra Leone, which include last year\u2019s ban on child marriage.",
      "The bill also would allow wider access to family planning and reproductive health services. Activists fear those will be lost if the bill fails.",
      "Both sides in the debate have accused each other of being sponsored by foreign governments.",
      "Some conservative U.S. media have framed the bill in Sierra Leone as a \u201cBiden-backed push\u201d for abortion rights in Africa.",
      "The U.S. embassy in Freetown denied involvement in the bill.",
      "Sierra Leone's Inter-Religious Council has cited the recent changes on abortion access in the U.S. as reference points in their position papers opposing the bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the reality for some pregnant women and girls remains harrowing.",
      "Many healthcare practitioners told the AP they want the bill to pass so they can save lives without fear.",
      "Samura the nurse recalled a mother who had traveled for hours in agony to the capital after drinking a concoction given to her by a traditional healer. Samura accompanied the patient to a hospital to seek treatment for a distended abdomen, severe septicemia and anemia.",
      "The mother of six died in the waiting room.",
      "\u201cRight there on the couch \u2026. everybody was crying,\u201d Samura said. \u201cAnytime I think of her, I wish the bill had been long passed.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.",
      "Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days.",
      "Officials in Andong, a city in the country\u2019s southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters \u2014 including schools and indoor gyms \u2014 as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple\u2019s national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.",
      "The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.",
      "More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.",
      "The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country\u2019s southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.",
      "Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.",
      "The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country\u2019s acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.",
      "Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.",

      "Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22 and engineers in the Royal Air Force, admitted in Reading Magistrates\u2019 Court that they were responsible for the March 2 vandalism in Newbury, the hometown of Paddington creator Michael Bond.",
      "\u201cPaddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike,\u201d Judge Sam Goozee said. \u201cHe represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. ... Your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for.\u201d",
      "The statue of the bear in his signature blue coat and red hat was one of 23 installed last fall as part of a Paddington trail across England to mark the release of \u201cPaddington in Peru.\u201d The introspective bear is gazing skyward while clutching a sandwich \u2014 with marmalade about to drip on his lap.",

      "Prosecutor said Jamie Renuka said the men were drunk during the escapade that was captured by a surveillance camera on the empty street just before 2 a.m. The two spirited away half of the statue in a taxi and returned to RAF Odiham base where the purloined Paddington was later found in Lawrence\u2019s car.",
      "Goozee said the crime could \u201conly be described as an act of wanton vandalism\u201d and that the two had failed to uphold the respect and integrity expected in the military.",
      "The pair, who admitted criminal damage, were ordered to perform community work and each to pay 2,725 pounds ($3,527) for repairs to the damaged statue.",
      "An RAF spokesperson said the service would consider the court's findings but that any discipline would not be disclosed because it would be a private matter.",

      "Greenland and Denmark appear cautiously relieved by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday",
      "Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.",
      "The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance\u2019s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.",
      "The vice president\u2019s decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing. The minister said the change was a deescalation, even as he said the Americans are treating it as the opposite, with Vance suggesting in an online video that global security is at stake.",
      "Anne Merrild, a professor and Arctic expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders.",
      "Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.",
      "\u201cIt's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.\u201d",
      "Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland.",
      "\u201cWhat is controversial here is all about the timing,\u201d he said. \u201cGreenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don\u2019t want the U.S. to visit right now, when Greenland doesn\u2019t have a government in place,\" following the election earlier this month. Coalition negotiations are ongoing.",
      "Ahead of the vice president\u2019s announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had \u201cnot extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.\u201d",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was \u201cunacceptable pressure.\"",
      "Usha Vance's office said Sunday that she would depart Thursday for Greenland and return Saturday. She and one of the couple's three children had planned to visit historic sites and learn about Greenland\u2019s culture, but her husband\u2019s participation has reoriented the trip around national security, her office said.",
      "Vance said leaders in Denmark and North America had \u201cignored\u201d Greenland for \u201cfar too long.\u201d",

      "The 27-nation European Union is also pressing ahead with a so-called steel \u201cporcupine strategy\u201d aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defense industry. Britain is also pledging continued military aid so Ukraine can keep fighting if peace talks fail or a ceasefire is broken.",
      "The basket of possible options that military chiefs and planners have been looking at in their own meetings in Paris and in the U.K. includes an array of scenarios that they've been preparing for their government leaders to consider and, ultimately, green light.",
      "A possible option that France has been pushing would be a deployment by coalition members of a sizable force \u2014 large enough to serve toward deterrence \u2014 in central Ukraine, somewhere along the Dnieper River, away from the frontlines, said a French official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the closed-door military planning discussions.",
      "The official said other possible options being examined are deploying a support force even further away from the fronts, in Ukraine's far west, or in a neighboring country.",
      "British officials have said a Europe-led force could consist of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops \u2014 which would be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming.",
      "A second French official, at the president's office, said France does not envisage a troop contingent serving in Ukraine as \u201ccombat forces\u201d but rather as \u201creassurance forces. That is to say signals of our presence, of support for Ukraine in various military tasks.\" The official also spoke anonymously, under the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "The official said missions and contours of the proposed force are still a work in progress but the aim remains for France and Britain to put it together with \u201cnumerous European countries.\u201d",
      "But some countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because one of the big unknowns is whether U.S. military forces and intelligence agencies would get Trump's green light to offer back-office support for any European force in Ukraine.",
      "Russia is bristling at the prospect of a force involving NATO-nation troops and demanding that military and intelligence aid for Ukraine cease.",
      "The war has turned the leaders of France and Ukraine into close partners. Macron and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will get the summit ball rolling by meeting first together at the Elysee on Wednesday night, to prepare the talks due to start at 10 a.m. the next morning. Macron will give a press conference after the discussions.",

      "South Korea\u2019s opposition leader Lee Jae-myung has been cleared of his election law violation charges at an appellate court",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- An appeals court in South Korea overturned an election law conviction against opposition leader Lee Jae-myung Wednesday, potentially clearing the way for him to mount a presidential campaign.",
      "The courtroom victory comes as the country's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol could face an early exit due to his short-lived imposition of martial law and surveys show Lee, leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, is the early favorite to replace him.",
      "Yoon, a conservative, has been suspended from office since the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached him over his Dec. 3 martial law decree plunged the country into political turmoil. The Constitutional Court is deliberating on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate him. If he's removed, there will be an election to replace him within two months.",
      "On Wednesday, the Seoul High Court overturned Lee's conviction for making false statements during his 2022 presidential campaign, canceling his suspended sentence of a year in prison. Lee still faces four other criminal trials, none of which are likely to be resolved soon.",
      "Lee was convicted by the Seoul Central District Court in November of making false statements about a controversial land development project launched when he was a city mayor, and about his relationships with a subordinate who killed himself after being embroiled in a scandal surrounding another development project.",
      "Under South Korean law, anyone who receives a fine exceeding 1 million won ($683) for election law violations is barred from running for elections for five years, and anyone who receives a prison sentence, including suspended sentences, cannot run for 10 years.",
      "Lee might be able to become president despite his conviction in lower-level courts, as the prohibition does not go into force until all appeals are exhausted and as president he would have immunity from most criminal prosecution. Still, observers say that if the appellate court had upheld his conviction it could have posed a significant political challenge.",
      "After the ruling, Lee appeared outside the court and thanked the court for making \u201ca right ruling based on truth and justices\u201d as his supporters shouted his name. Lee accused the Yoon government and state prosecutors of having fabricated evidence against him.",
      "The court said that prosecutors have seven days to appeal Wednesday\u2019s verdict to the Supreme Court, the top court in South Korea.",
      "Yoon's ruling People Power Party expressed strong regret over Wednesday's ruling, saying the Supreme Court must rule quickly on an appeal.",

      "Actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu has testified on Day 2 of his trial in Paris on sexual assault charges",
      "PARIS -- French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu acknowledged Tuesday that he aggressively subjected a woman who accuses him of sexual assault to vulgar and heated language and that he grabbed her hips but denied that his behavior was sexual as he testified for the first time at his landmark trial in Paris.",
      "The woman told the court that the Oscar-nominated actor behaved \u201clike a madman\u201d who took \u201cpleasure in frightening me.\u201d",
      "Day 2 of the Paris trial centered on the 76-year-old actor's behavior during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.",
      "Depardieu has denied assaulting the women. But in his testimony Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.",
      "Depardieu said he'd been in a \u201cbad mood\" because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.",
      "\u201cI understand perfectly if she\u2019s a bit upset,\u201d he said in his gruff, deep voice so familiar to cinemagoers. \u201cI don\u2019t have to talk like that, get angry like that, voil\u00e0.\"",
      "But he insisted that he isn't a sexual predator, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t touch women\u2019s butts.\u201d",
      "He recognized that the woman may have felt \u201csuffocated\u201d by his behavior, which he described as a \"type of aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut certainly not sexual. Non!\u201d he exclaimed, raising his voice.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict isn't expected immediately after the trial.",
      "After Depardieu spoke first for more than an hour, the set dresser then testified. She described the alleged assault in detail, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \"in front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I had a reflex of \u2018My God.' I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn\u2019t do it,\" she testified. \u201cHe terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.\"",
      "\u201cIt was very brief, there was no shouting,\u201d she said, adding that she'd been too \u201cpetrified\u201d to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu\u2019s hands from her.",
      "\u201cI saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that\u2019s what I felt, it's savagery,\u201d she said. \"He terrified me, and that amused him.\u201d",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor's calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "\u201cHere, he\u2019s exemplary, he doesn\u2019t move, he\u2019s quiet, he doesn\u2019t make any noise,\" she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.\"",
      "On the movie set, \u201che started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities,\u201d she said.",
      "The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.",
      "Because of Depardieu\u2019s fame and impact on the French movie industry, his trial is seen as an important test of French willingness to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.",
      "His long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he's made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac. French President Emmanuel Macron has included himself among Depardieu's many admirers, calling him a \u201cgreat actor\u201d who \"makes France proud.\u201d That was in 2023, when the star was already facing sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "In his testimony, Depardieu said work has dried up as accusations have mounted. Since 2022, he's not had a big-screen lead role.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s horrible what they\u2019re doing to me, calling me a \u2018big pig\u2019! I haven\u2019t worked for three years,\u201d he said.",
      "He also has health issues. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he\u2019s fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don\u2019t exceed six hours, with regular breaks.",
      "The trial represents another reckoning for France and its attitudes to sexual violence, coming in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. She became a feminist icon when she bravely demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for horrific abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would make shame change sides.",
      "Depardieu said he apologized to the set dresser three days after the alleged assault. He said he recognized that she was in \u201cshock\u201d and \u201cpetrified.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is not what I wanted,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged to the court that his behavior can be boorish.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been told I have a Russian nature, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the drinking or the vulgarity,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.\"",
      "But he said he \u201cnever, ever\u201d would have pincered a woman between his legs against her will.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not like that,\" he said.",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low.",
      "Carney also said the kinship that exists between U.S. and Canada is under more strain than at any point in the two countries storied histories.",
      "\u201cHis trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,\" Carney said while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada's April 28 election.",
      "The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. Trump has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.",
      "Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as all of America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 on April 2.",
      "\u201cHe wants to break us so America can own us,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAnd it will never ever happen because we just don\u2019t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.\u201d",
      "Carney, former two-time central banker, made the comments while campaigning near the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing.",
      "Carney said the bridge carries 140 billion Canadian dollars ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day.",
      "\"Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,\" Carney said. \u201cThe relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.\u201d",
      "Carney announced Wednesday a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) \u201cstrategic response fund\" that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Liberal Party leader noted the bridge is especially important to Canada\u2019s auto sector, the country\u2019s second largest export. He said Canada's auto sector employs 125,000 jobs directly and almost another 500,000 jobs in related industries, many of them union jobs.",
      "\u201cCanada will be there for auto workers,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, as worries persist the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing.",
      "In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.",
      "Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. The American president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.",
      "The new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump. It is unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.",

      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet charged Bolsonaro last month with plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his opponent and current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Part of that plan allegedly included poisoning Lula and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of Bolsonaro.",
      "Five Supreme Court justices \u2014 including de Moraes, the rapporteur \u2014 will meet from 9:30 a.m. local time in Brasilia to rule on the charges leveled by Gonet. If a majority votes in favor, the accused will become defendants in a criminal case.",

      "Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says that he's being politically persecuted.",
      "Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but combined with the other charges, he could be sentenced to decades behind bars.",

      "\u201cThere is no shadow of a doubt that there are very clear elements\u201d that crimes were committed, said Thiago Bottino, a law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university. \u201cThe current tendency is that there will be a criminal trial.\u201d",
      "Gonet filed charges against a total of 34 people in February. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will analyze whether to accept charges against eight of them. As well as Bolsonaro, the court will vote on the accusations faced by former Defense Ministers Walter Braga Netto and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira and ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres, among others. The court will decide on the others' fates later on.",
      "Bolsonaro has sought to shore up political support before the possible trial, including by holding a protest on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on March 16.",
      "Local media reported that around 18,000 people attended the rally, based on figures from a monitoring project linked to the University of Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro\u2019s allies had hoped to draw a crowd of 1 million, which led some analysts to say that his ability to mobilize voters is diminishing.",
      "Bolsonaro called on social media Sunday for a new demonstration on April 6, to be held on one of Sao Paulo\u2019s main arteries, Avenida Paulista.",
      "As with the protest earlier this month, the former president and his allies will push for Congress to grant amnesty to those in jail for their roles in the Jan. 8, 2023 riot, when Bolsonaro\u2019s die-hard fans stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, Presidential Palace and Congress a week after Lula took office.",
      "In his indictment of Bolsonaro and others linked to him, Gonet said that the rampage was a last-ditch attempt to hold onto power.",

      "He has already been banned by Brazil\u2019s top electoral court from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.",

The move Tuesday comes during strained diplomatic relations with the country, including over its stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Turkey\u2019s president on Wednesday accused the political opposition of \u201csinking the economy\u201d during the country\u2019s largest protests in more than a decade over the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor, the biggest challenger to Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule.",
      "The party of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has called for a boycott of companies that it says support Erdogan\u2019s government. The Turkish president accused the opposition of being \u201cso desperate that they would throw the country and the nation into the fire.\u201d",
      "In his address to lawmakers with his Justice and Development Party, or AKP, Erdogan added that \u201csabotage targeting the Turkish economy will be held accountable before the courts.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu was arrested a week ago. He faces charges related to corruption and supporting terrorism within the Istanbul municipality alongside some 90 other suspects. A court ordered him to be imprisoned Sunday. A trial date has not been announced.",
      "Many consider the case against Imamoglu to be politically motivated. The government says the judiciary is free of political influence.",
      "The evidence against Imamoglu has not been officially disclosed. Many Turkish media outlets have reported that it is largely based on \u201csecret witnesses.\u201d The use of such testimony has been seen in previous criminal cases against opposition politicians.",
      "The head the opposition Iyi Party, Musavat Dervisoglu, questioned the evidence of corruption in Istanbul municipality. \u201cDozens of inspectors have gone, 1,300 inspections have been made, nothing has come out of these inspections,\u201d he told party lawmakers.",
      "Also Wednesday, members of Istanbul\u2019s municipality were voting for a proxy mayor to stand in for Imamoglu. Imamoglu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, has a majority in the municipal assembly and was likely to select Nuri Aslan, the deputy mayor under Imamoglu.",
      "While the CHP has said it will no longer organize mass rallies at City Hall, students across Turkey continue protesting. Demonstrations in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, as well as smaller cities and towns, have been largely peaceful. Protesters demand Imamoglu\u2019s release and an end to democratic backsliding.",
      "Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya has said that 1,418 people have been detained in the past week over the protests.",
      "Egitim-Sen, a trade union representing teachers and university lecturers, said its Istanbul University representative was detained. Student leftist groups said some of their members were also detained at their homes.",
      "Turkey is not due for another election until 2028, but it's possible that Erdogan will call for an early vote to seek another term.",
      "Imamoglu has been confirmed as the candidate for the CHP and has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan. His election as mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in 2019 was a major blow to Erdogan and his party.",

      "South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulate...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The landmark report released Wednesday followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States, and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea\u2019s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and \u201980s.",
      "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government-appointed fact-finding panel, said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May.",
      "However, some adoptees and even a senior investigator on the commission criticized the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government\u2019s complicity.",
      "That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, a standing commissioner, also lamented the panel\u2019s decision-making committee\u2019s 5-4 vote on Tuesday to defer assessments of 42 other adoptees\u2019 cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission\u2019s conservative chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions.",
      "However, Lee implied that some committee members were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified \u2014 either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them.",
      "Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives.",
      "Lee said the commission\u2019s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I find yesterday\u2019s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,\u201d Lee said.",
      "After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children, including those born to poor parents or unwed mothers.",
      "Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea\u2019s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their possession and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in \"large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,\u201d the commission said.",
      "Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children\u2019s identities, according to the commission\u2019s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.",
      "The commission recommended the South Korean government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States \u2014 the largest recipient of Korean children by far \u2014 and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions, which have drawn growing international attention amid criticism that thousands of children were carelessly or unnecessarily separated from their biological families. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the government department that handles adoption issues, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the commission\u2019s report.",
      "Around 200,000 South Koreans were adopted to Western countries in the past seven decades, forming what\u2019s believed to be the world\u2019s largest diaspora of adoptees.",
      "Most were placed with white parents in the United States and Europe during the 1970-80s. South Korea's then military leaders focused on economic growth and saw adoptions as a tool to reduce welfare burdens, erase the \u201csocial problem\u201d of unwed mothers and deepen ties with the democratic West.",
      "The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to the heads of private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year.",
      "Recent reforms, including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight by requiring foreign adoptions to go through family courts, have led to a significant decline in the overseas placements of South Korean children, with only 79 cases in 2023.",

      "But some isolated areas, including the Catatumbo region, have seen an uptick in homicides, extorsion and forced displacement, as smaller groups fight for control of territories abandoned by the FARC.",

      "Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn\u2019t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.",

      "Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.",
      "But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. A recent study released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.",
      "The amount of these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.",
      "\u201cThey are very widespread,\u201d said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they're not in all biosolids and sometimes it's only in small amounts, he added.",
      "Here's how they're made:",
      "At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.",
      "After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.",
      "The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.",
      "The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.",
      "After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for land-applied biosolids.",
      "\u201cThere are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,\u201d including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.",
      "Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.",
      "The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what\u2019s in the water.

      "Someone should have spotted the alarming number of near misses in the skies over the nation's capital before the fatal midair collision that killed 67 people in January, and reviewing the data now could prevent future crashes, according to the head of the agency investigating the crash.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy emphasized to Congress Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration had data going back to 2011 showing that collision alarms were sounding inside cockpits at least once a month because of how close the planes were getting to helicopters. But the FAA didn't act, she said.",
      "\u201cAll this data is being collected by FAA from operators, from others, from voluntary reporting systems. Where is that data going to trend potential accidents and incidents in the future?\u201d Homendy said during a hearing on her agency's budget. \u201cThe next accident is in the data right now. And what are we doing to figure out what that is?\u201d",
      "The Senate is planning another hearing Thursday to delve deeper into what the NTSB has found so far about the Jan. 29 midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., Ronald Reagan National Airport. Homendy and the leaders of the FAA and Army's aviation division will all testify.",
      "Both Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month when NTSB first disclosed the shocking statistics that they were angry that the FAA didn't recognize the dangers before this crash after 85 near misses in the past three years when aircraft flew within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other.",
      "The FAA promptly launched a review of all its data after the NTSB briefing to try to identify any similar safety threats, particularly in eight cities with heavy helicopter traffic. The FAA said Wednesday that analysis continues.",
      "That review \u2014 aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 is focused on airports in Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles and the heavy helicopter traffic off the Gulf Coast. The FAA hasn't said whether it has found anything yet, but the agency promised it \u201cwill have corrective action plans for any risks that are identified.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, the FAA quickly adopted the NTSB's recommendation to permanently close off a particular helicopter route near Reagan anytime planes are taking off or landing on the airport's runway 33 that the jetliner was approaching in January when the collision happened. If a helicopter does need to use that route for an urgent reason, no planes will be allowed to take off or land. That should ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace near the airport, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe FAA will continue to closely support the NTSB-led investigation and take action as necessary to ensure public safety,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Homendy declined Wednesday to address President Donald Trump's comments right after the crash suggesting that diversity and inclusion policies at the FAA may have contributed to it because the NTSB investigation isn't complete. A final report identifying the cause isn't expected for more than year. Trump also faulted the helicopter for flying too high and later suggested that an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system was the problem.",
      "New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said it is important to refute those diversity comments now because nothing has been found so far to support them, and she doesn't want the public to get the idea that diversity is the problem.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, loyalty and sycophants seems to be the order of the day, and it\u2019s definitely negatively impacting this federal government doing its job,\u201d Watson Coleman said during the hearing.",
      "Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.",
      "The NTSB previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The helicopter was at 278 feet (85 meters) at the time of the collision, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",

      "The bill is headed to Gov. Matt Meyer, a Democrat who met with corporate leaders about their concerns about precedent-setting court decisions governing corporate conflicts of interest and urged lawmakers to quickly pass changes to the law.",
      "They did, sending the bill through both chambers within two weeks of its introduction, despite shareholders\u2019 lawyers, consumer groups and pension funds slamming it as a giveaway to billionaires and corporate insiders. The House approved it Tuesday night, 32-7, after a unanimous Senate earlier in March.",
      "Delaware\u2019s experienced corporate law courts and their well-developed body of corporate case law have become the go-to destination to settle all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "The state also reaps billions of dollars from the activity, making lawmakers nervous that corporations could flee Delaware and undercut a major source of revenue that funds one-third of Delaware's operating budget.",
      "After two hours of debate Tuesday, Rep. Krista Griffith told colleagues that the bill was complex, but the reasons for voting for it were simple: \u201cProtect Delaware\u2019s economy, protect future opportunities for the people in our state. We have the best business court in the nation.\u201d",
      "However, an opponent, Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton \u2014 referring to the business courts as Delaware's \u201cgolden goose\u201d \u2014 warned that the changes being passed could end up \"cooking that golden goose.\u201d",

      "Corporate leaders complained about a lack of predictability, clarity and fairness, lawmakers were told.",
      "Last year, Musk slammed Delaware, saying \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\u201d and instead recommended Nevada or Texas as destinations after a Delaware judge invalidated his landmark compensation package from Tesla worth potentially more than $55 billion.",
      "Musk and Tesla are appealing in the state Supreme Court, and Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink \u2014 all departed Delaware for Nevada or Texas.",
      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta \u2014 run by billionaire chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 didn\u2019t confirm the report.",
      "The bill has come under withering criticism that it will tilt the playing field decisively against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers, and make it harder for them to hold billionaires and corporate insiders accountable for violating their fiduciary duty.",
      "In a statement, the Consumer Federation of America said Delaware's lawmakers \u201cclearly failed to protect investors with the passage of the Billionaire\u2019s Bill.\u201d",
      "Opponents argue that the bill overturns decades of court precedents. But its backers say it is only affecting newer precedents, modernizing the law, clarifying gray areas and maintaining balance between corporate officers and shareholders.",
      "The bill changes several provisions.",
      "One, it gives corporate officers and controlling stockholders more protections in certain conflict-of-interest cases in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",

      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is supporting the conservative candidate in the race to fill a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which could ultimately decide a Tesla lawsuit",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk and political groups he backs are pouring millions of dollars into the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court as the electric vehicle company sues to overturn a state law that prevents it from opening dealerships \u2014 a case that eventually could make its way to the high court.",
      "Tesla's multiple attempts to open its own dealerships in Wisconsin keep running up against a state law that allows only third parties, not auto manufacturers, to operate them. The company filed a lawsuit in January seeking an exemption, just as two Musk-backed political action committees started supporting the Republican-backed candidate, Brad Schimel, over his opponent, Susan Crawford, who is supported by Democrats.",
      "Musk, who is the world's wealthiest person and is running President Donald Trump's initiative to slash the size of the federal workforce, has given $3 million to the Wisconsin GOP while groups he supports have funneled more than $17 million into the race. The contributions are part of an extraordinary spending spree in the race, making it by far the most expensive judicial race on record in the U.S. Total spending has eclipsed $80 million with days still to go before the final day of voting on April 1.",
      "Schimel's critics have accused Musk of trying to buy a favorable ruling for Tesla should the dealership case make it to the state Supreme Court. Here are details of the law and Musk's lawsuit:",
      "State statutes generally prohibit vehicle manufacturers from owning or operating dealerships in Wisconsin and give that franchise to third parties. The law was intended to prevent manufacturers from undercutting independent dealerships.",
      "Nearly 20 states have similar prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The laws took hold in the 1930s as carmakers started to rely on independent dealerships to sell and service vehicles so they could focus on production. Later, independent dealers wanted to prevent manufacturers from opening their own dealerships and driving them out of business.",
      "Tesla sells its vehicles directly to consumers, who can have their vehicles shipped directly to them or to dealerships in 27 states. Because the company can't set up its own dealerships in Wisconsin, buyers there must have the cars delivered to them or travel to dealerships in neighboring Minnesota or Illinois to pick them up.",
      "Tesla officials have been working for almost a decade to secure an exemption from the law. Republican legislators introduced bills in 2017 and 2021 that would permit Tesla dealerships, but none of those made it out of the Legislature. They inserted an exemption for Tesla dealerships into the 2019-21 state budget, but Democratic Gov. Tony Evers used his partial veto powers to erase the provision.",
      "The Wisconsin Automobile and Truck Dealers Association has been fighting to preserve the law. Bill Sepic, the association's president and CEO, told The Associated Press that Tesla should have to follow the law like any other vehicle manufacturer. He said the statutes exist to enable third parties to act as consumer advocates \u201cin making one of the larger purchases of their life.\u201d",
      "Tesla filed a lawsuit in state court in January seeking permission to open four dealerships in Wisconsin.",
      "The company argues that independent dealers wouldn't meet its standards and says selling vehicles at its own dealerships is in the public interest because unaffiliated dealers' prices are higher and less transparent.",
      "Its lawsuit says that the state law barring manufacturers from running their own dealerships violates economic liberty rights and that the prohibition exists only to protect independent dealers from competition.",
      "The case is pending in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, though no hearings have been scheduled.",
      "The state Justice Department is defending the law. An agency spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Schimel, the conservative state Supreme Court candidate, is vying with Crawford for an open seat on the high court.",
      "The race is the most significant election nationally since the November presidential contest, providing an early barometer for Republicans and Democrats given the intense interest and outside spending it has generated. It also will determine whether the highest court in the perennial presidential battleground state will flip from liberal to conservative control with major cases involving abortion, union rights and congressional redistricting on the horizon.",
      "Eight days after Tesla filed the Wisconsin dealership lawsuit, Musk tweeted: \u201cVery important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\u201d",
      "To be clear, there has been no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Wisconsin. Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the state over then-President Donald Trump in 2020 was affirmed by a recount and an independent audit. Trump, a Republican, won the state last November and offered no objections then to the voting or ballot-counting.",
      "According to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice, Musk-backed groups America PAC and Building America's Future have spent more than $17 million to support Schimel with ads and flyers. The money he donated to the state Republican Party has been used to help Schimel, who has been endorsed by Trump.",
      "Crawford's supporters contend the timing of the contributions show Musk is trying to ensure that Schimel wins and creates a conservative majority on the court that ultimately would rule in Tesla's favor. Crawford said during a debate with Schimel this month that Musk \u201chas basically taken over Brad Schimel's campaign.\u201d",
      "Sepic, president of the state dealership association, said Wisconsin should elect the candidate who enforces the prohibition but declined to comment when asked if he thought Schimel or Crawford would do that.",
      "Schimel has repeatedly said he would treat any case involving Tesla the same as any other when he considers whether to hear it or recuse himself. Schimel also has insisted that the donations from Musk and his groups do not make him beholden to them.",
      "Crawford has said the same thing about billionaires who have donated to her campaign, including George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Soros has contributed $2 million and Pritzker $1.5 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, which has funneled the money to Crawford\u2019s campaign.",

      "When announcing his replacement, Uchida called Espinosa \u201ca car guy.\u201d",
      "Espinosa, who drives a Z sportscar, Nissan\u2019s flagship nameplate, said he saw himself as \u201ca car lover.\u201d He loves the stories behind each car, he said, like how it\u2019s developed and becomes loved by customers.",
      "Analysts have so far taken a cautious approach to Espinosa\u2019s appointment. As an insider, he takes up where Uchida left off, meaning the verdict is still out.",
      "\u201cWe view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy, once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d CreditSights analysts Todd Duvick and Will Lee wrote in a recent commentary.",

      "Since the 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, communities across Hawaii have sought ways to protect themselves from more destructive fires wrought by decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies",
      "KULA, Hawaii -- The car tires, propane tanks, gas generators and rusty appliances heaped on the side of a dirt road waiting to be hauled away filled Desiree Graham with relief.",
      "\u201cThat means all that stuff is not in people\u2019s yards,\" she said on a blustery July day in Kahikinui, a remote Native Hawaiian homestead community in southeast Maui where wildfire is a top concern.",
      "In June, neighbors and volunteers spent four weekends clearing rubbish from their properties in a community-wide effort to create \u201cdefensible space,\u201d or areas around homes free of ignitable vegetation and debris. They purged 12 tons of waste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ugly, but it\u2019s pretty beautiful to me,\u201d said Graham, a member of Kahikinui's Firewise committee, part of a rapidly growing program from the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association that helps residents assess their communities' fire risk and create plans to mitigate it.",
      "Kahikinui is one of dozens of Hawaii communities seeking ways to protect themselves as decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies culminate to cause more destructive fires.",
      "The state has 250,000 acres of unmanaged fallow agricultural land, nearly all of its buildings sit within the wildland-urban interface, and two-thirds of communities have only one road in and out.",
      "But experts say that even with so many factors out of communities\u2019 control, they can vastly improve their resilience \u2014 by transforming their own neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFire is not like other natural hazards, it can only move where there is fuel, and we have a lot of say in that,\u201d said Nani Barretto, co-executive director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization (HWMO), a 25-year-old nonprofit at the forefront of the state\u2019s fire-risk mitigation.",
      "Neighborhoods all over the United States are wrestling with the same challenge, some in places that never worried about fire before. A recent Headwaters Economics analysis found 1,100 communities in 32 states shared similar risk profiles to places recently devastated by urban wildfires.",
      "HWMO helps communities like Kahikinui become Firewise. In the 10 years preceding the August 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, 15 Hawaii communities joined Firewise USA. Since then, the number has more than doubled to 31, with a dozen more in the process of joining.",
      "\u201cEveryone was like, \u2019My God, what can we do?'\u201d said Shelly Aina, former chair of the Firewise committee for Waikoloa Village, an 8,000-resident community on the west side of the Big Island, recalling the months after the Maui fires.",
      "The development \u2014 heavily wind exposed, surrounded by dry invasive grasses and with just one main road in and out \u2014 had already experienced several close calls in the last two decades. It was first recognized as Firewise in 2016.",
      "As HWMO-trained home assessors, Shelly and her husband Dana Aina have done over 60 free assessments for neighbors since 2022, evaluating their properties for ignition vulnerabilities. Volunteers removed kiawe trees last year along a fuel break bordering houses. Residents approved an extra HOA fee for vegetation removal on interior lots.",
      "Measures like these can have outsized impact as people in fire-prone states adapt to more extreme wildfires, according to Dr. Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service scientist.",
      "\u201cThe solution is in the community, not out there with the fire breaks, because those don\u2019t stop the fire in extreme conditions,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Direct flames from a wildfire aren\u2019t what typically initiate an urban conflagration, he said. Wind-blown embers can travel miles away from a fire, landing on combustible material like dry vegetation, or accumulating in corners like where a deck meets siding.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re urban fires, not wildfires,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "The solutions don't always require expensive retrofits like a whole new roof, but targeting the specific places within 100 feet of the house where embers could ignite material. In dense neighborhoods, that requires residents work together, making community-wide efforts like Firewise important. \u201cThe house is only as ignition resistant as its neighbors,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Even with renewed interest in fire resilience, community leaders face challenges in mobilizing their neighbors. Mitigation can take money, time and sacrifice. It\u2019s not enough to cut the grass once, for example, vegetation has to be regularly maintained. Complacency sets in. Measures like removing hazardous trees can cost thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we deal with that, because those who have them can\u2019t afford to take them down,\u201d said Shelly Aina. The Ainas try offering low-cost measures, like installing metal screening behind vents and crawl spaces to keep out embers.",
      "HWMO helps with costs where it can. It gave Kahikinui a $5,000 grant for a dumpster service to haul out its waste, and helped Waikoloa Village rent a chipper for the trees it removed. It\u2019s been hard to keep up with the need, said Barretto, but even just a little bit of financial assistance can have an exponential impact.",
      "\u201cYou give them money, they rally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can give them $1,000 and it turns into 1,000 man hours of doing the clearing.\u201d HWMO was able to expand its grant program after the Maui fires with donations from organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund and the American Red Cross.",
      "At a time when federal funding for climate mitigation is uncertain, communities need far more financial support to transform their neighborhoods, said Headwaters Economics' Kimi Barrett, who studies the costs of increasing fire risk. \u201cIf what we\u2019re trying to do is save people and communities, then we must significantly invest in people and communities,\u201d said Barrett.",
      "Those investments are just a fraction of the billions of dollars in losses sustained after megafires, said Barrett. A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Allstate found that $1 in resilience and preparation investment can save $13 in economic and property losses after a disaster.",
      "Another hurdle is asking residents to do work and make sacrifices as they watch others neglect their role. \u201cThe neighbors will ask, \u2018What about the county land?' There\u2019s no routine maintenance,\u2019\u201d said Shelly Aina.",
      "Her husband Dana Aina said he reminds people that it is everyone\u2019s kuleana, or responsibility, to take care of land and people. \u201cAn island is a canoe, a canoe is an island,\u201d he said, quoting a Hawaiian proverb. \u201cWe all have to paddle together.\u201d",
      "Bigger stakeholders are starting to make changes. Among them, Hawaii passed legislation to create a state fire marshal post, and its main utility, Hawaiian Electric, is undergrounding some power lines and installing AI-enabled cameras to detect ignitions earlier.",
      "Meanwhile, Firewise communities have found that doing their own mitigation gives them more clout when asking for funding or for others to do their part.",
      "After the 66-residence community of Kawaihae Village on Hawaii Island joined Firewise, they were finally able to get a neighboring private landowner and the state to create fuel breaks and clear grasses.",
      "\u201cWithout that we wouldn\u2019t have been on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d said Brenda DuFresne, committee member of Kawaihae Firewise. \u201cI think Firewise is a way to show people that you\u2019re willing to help yourself.\u201d",

      "The Black creators of some consumers products are rethinking their business plans as major U.S. companies end or water down their diversity, equity and inclusion programs",
      "NEW YORK -- The co-founders of a company that makes lip products for darker skin tones no longer hope to get their line into Target. A brother and sister who make jigsaw puzzles celebrating Black subjects wonder if they need to offer \u201cneutral\u201d images like landscapes to keep growing.",
      "Pound Cake and Puzzles of Color are among the small businesses whose owners are rethinking their plans as major U.S. companies weaken their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The initiatives mostly date from the end President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and entered a new era with the dawn of his second one.",
      "Some Black-owned brands suspect big retail chains will drop partnerships they pursued after the police killing of a Black man in 2020 reignited mass protests against racial injustice. In today's anti-DEI climate, other entrepreneurs worry about personal repercussions or feel pressure to cancel contracts with retreating retailers.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a question of, are the big box stores going to be there? Do we even make any attempt to talk to these people?\" Ericka Chambers, one of the siblings behind Puzzles of Color, said. \u201cWe are really having to evaluate our strategy in how we expand and how we want to get in front of new customers.\u201d",
      "Chambers and her brother, William Jones, started turning the work of artists of color into frameable puzzles the same year a video captured a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck. Amid the Black Lives Matter protests over Floyd's death, a fashion designer challenged large retailers to devote 15% of their shelf space and purchasing power to Black businesses.",
      "The Fifteen Percent Pledge helped bring Puzzles of Color's creations to Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom\u2019s websites in 2022. Last year, they made it into select Barnes & Noble stores. Chambers said she's confident in the companies' commitments but recalled a backlash after news outlets covered the brand, which is based in Texas.",
      "\u201cIt does make us think about how we envision ourselves as far as the safety of not wanting to be attacked, because some people are very vocal about being anti-DEI,\u201d Chambers said.",
      "Vibrant depictions of Black women account for many of her and Jones' puzzles. The pair figured they needed to provide more abstract designs for certain Barnes & Noble locations to give Puzzles of Color \u201ca little bit of a fighting chance.\u201d",
      "The first prominent names in U.S. retail to end or retool their diversity programs surfaced last summer amid threats of legal challenges and negative publicity from DEI critics, who argue that setting hiring, promotion and supplier diversity goals for underrepresented groups constitutes reverse discrimination.",
      "After Trump won a second term in November, Walmart joined the corporate pullback. Target's suspension of its comparable DEI targets in January stung Black and LGBTQ+ customers harder, largely because they regarded the Minneapolis-based company as more of a natural ally.",
      "The company said it would continue working with a diverse range of businesses. Philadelphia-based Pound Cake's co-founders, Camille Belle and Johnny Velazquez, said they don't think they would agree at this point if the retailer offered to stock their lipsticks and lip oils.",
      "\u201cTarget would have been a great boost to our business\u2019s growth,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just find it elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Target's stance has created a dilemma for brand founders with existing distribution deals. One is Play Pits, a natural deodorant for children that Maryland resident Chantel Powell launched in 2021. The product is found in about 360 Target stores.",
      "The retailer's DEI program \u201callowed us to employ amazing people, give back to our community, and exhibit Black excellence on and off the shelves,\u201d Powell wrote on LinkedIn as civil rights leaders talked about boycotting Target.",
      "She and some other product creators highlighted the impact boycotts might have on their businesses. They urged upset customers to intentionally limit their purchases to items from Black-owned enterprises. Some activists understood; others pushed the brands to join the protest by cutting ties with Target.",
      "\u201cThe conversation around Black brands, that they should pull out of the retailers that they\u2019re in, is unrealistic,\u201d Powell said this month as a 40-day, church-organized Target boycott was underway. \u201cWe signed up to be in business. I understand why people are having that conversation of boycotts. As a Black founder, I also understand the side of how it can be detrimental.\u201d",
      "The owner of a Black-owned sexual wellness business with its own line of condoms has a slightly different take. Target started carrying B Condoms in 2020, and founder Jason Panda said the company told him late last year that it didn't intend to keep the prophylactics in the 304 stores that stocked them.",
      "Panda says he isn't worried. The product is available through Amazon and in more than 7,000 CVS stores, he said. What's more, contracts with non-profit organizations and local governments that distribute condoms for free are the cornerstone of the business he established in 2011, Panda said.",
      "\u201cMy money has never really come from mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're going to be protected as long as I can maintain my relationship with my community.\u201d",
      "Brianna Arps, who founded the fragrance brand Moodeaux in 2021, notices fewer grants available to Black brand creators these days. She used to apply for 10 to 15 every week or two; the number is down to five to seven, Arps said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the organizations that had been really vocal about supporting (Black businesses) have either quietly or outwardly pulled back,\u201d she said.",
      "Moodeaux was the first Black-owned perfume brand to get its perfumes into Urban Outfitters and Credo Beauty, which specializes in natural vegan products. In the current environment, Arps is looking to expand her brand's presence independent shops and to support other Black fragrance lovers.",
      "\u201cThe resiliency of brands like ours and founders like myself will still exist,\u201d she said.",
      "Aurora James, the founder of the Fifteen Percent Pledge, said nearly 30 major companies that joined the initiative remain committed to it, including Bloomingdale's, beauty retailer Sephora, J. Crew and Gap.",
      "Ulta Beauty, another pledge signatory, and Credo Beauty carry Pound Cake products. Velazquez and Belle want to use social media to direct their followers to support retailers like Ulta and to bolster their online sales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fostering the community that we have and growing that,\u201d Velazquez said.",
      "While making a strategic decision \u201cto appeal to a broader audience\u201d when selecting puzzles for Barnes & Noble, Chambers said she plans to introduce Black faces and experiences to the chain's bookstores over time, in boxes of 500, 750 and 1,000 pieces.",
      "In the meantime, Puzzles of Color expanded its \u201cPride\u201d collection as a response to the DEI backlash. The subjects include Harriet Tubman, a mother and daughter tending a garden, and a little girl in a beauty supply store gazing up at hair accessories.",
      "\u201cDo we lean in all the way?\" Chambers asks herself. \"Part of why we started this was because we didn\u2019t see enough Black people in puzzles.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Copper prices have hit record highs as an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its key trading partners threatens to squeeze supplies of the vital metal.",
      "Buyers in the U.S. have been stocking up on copper ahead of potential tariffs. Future prices for the base metal hit $5.21 per pound on Tuesday. Prices are up about 30% so far this year, following modest gains over the last several years.",
      "President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a tariff of up to 25% on all copper imports and has called for increasing U.S. production. China, the world's largest importer of copper, is embarking on a stimulus program that could further increase demand for the base metal.",
      "\u201cTariff threats, tightening supply, and stimulus-fueled optimism for an economic rebound in China have underpinned a rally in copper.\u201d said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.",
      "Copper is critical to energy infrastructure around the world. It goes into cords for electronic devices, transmission lines, batteries, and LED lights. A global shift to cleaner energy technology, such as solar power, had already been boosting demand, which is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the uses of copper in today\u2019s economy, those uses and the intensity of use of copper in today\u2019s economy are growing,\u201d said Kathleen L. Quirk, President and CEO of mining giant Freeport-McMoRan, at a recent conference for the global metals industry.",
      "The International Energy Agency expects demand for the base metal to rise 20% to 31,128 kilotons by 2030 and by 41% to 36,379 kilotons by 2040. The U.S. mined about 1.1 million tons of copper in 2024. It currently lags the top producers, including Chile, Peru and China.",
      "Copper mining companies are gaining ground amid rising demand. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan, which operates most of its open-pit copper mines in the U.S., are up 12% this year. Southern Copper, which has operations in Mexico and Peru, is up 8% for the year. The broader market has been slipping, with the S&P 500 down about 2%.",
      "The rising price of copper has a potential downside for some businesses and consumers.",
      "The construction industry, including homebuilders, could face a tighter financial squeeze because of copper's rising cost as demand fails to keep pace with supplies. Stubborn inflation has already pushed home construction costs higher. Total construction costs for a single-family home rose just under 9.2% in 2024 from the previous year, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD logged a record 777.1 billion yuan ($107 billion) in revenue last year as its sales of battery electric and hybrid vehicles jumped 40%.",
      "The report late Monday coincided with BYD\u2019s launch earlier this week of its Qin L EV sedan, a mid-sized model similar to Tesla's Model 3 but at just over half the price. Tesla\u2019s 2024 revenue was nearly $97.7 billion.",

      "Nearly 29% of the company's sales were in markets outside Greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, last year, up slightly from 27% the year before.",
      "The automaker has rapidly expanded its exports, though it has yet to try to sell in the U.S., where U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on car imports. BYD faces a 17% tariff on exports of EVs to the European Union.",

      "BANGKOK -- World markets were mixed on Wednesday after a day of subdued trading on Wall Street as investors awaited data releases later in the week and further developments in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade agenda.",
      "European markets opened mostly lower, with Germany's DAX down 0.6% to 22,973.53. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.6% to 8,057.88, while Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.2% higher.",

      "In Asian trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6% to 23,483.32, while the Shanghai Composite index slipped less than 0.1%, to 3,368.70.",

      "Later this week, the U.S. is due to report on economic growth, personal spending, orders of durable goods and other key data.",
      "On Tuesday, the S&P 500 added 0.2% after jumping 1.8% Monday to one of its best days of the past year, lifted by hopes that tariff increases might not be as sweeping as earlier feared.. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.5%.",
      "U.S. stocks have recovered a chunk of their losses  since falling 10% below their all-time high  earlier this month, in their first \u201ccorrection\u201d since 2023. The S&P 500 is down 6% from its record, and that drop has left the market looking less expensive than before, which had been a major criticism following its euphoric rise in earlier years.",

That\u2019s what Trump has called \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when he will begin tariffs on trading partners that he says will roughly equal what he sees as the burden each of them puts on the United States.",
      "Even if Trump\u2019s tariffs do end up being less painful for the global economy than feared, all the dizzying talk about them has already soured confidence among U.S. households and businesses. The fear is that could lead them to cut back on their spending and freeze the economy.",
      "A report on Tuesday showed that pessimism among U.S. households is only worsening. The Conference Board\u2019s measure of consumer confidence fell by more than expected, mostly because of a tumble for expectations about upcoming conditions in the short term. That dropped to its lowest level in 12 years and is sitting \u201cwell below the threshold of 80 that usually signals a recession ahead.\u201d",
      "Like other recent surveys, the data showed U.S. households are much more concerned about where the economy is heading than where it is currently. So far, actual economic activity and the job market seem to be holding up despite the worsening moods of U.S. companies and consumers.",
      "On Wall Street, Trump Media & Technology Group  climbed 8.9% after the company behind the president\u2019s Truth Social platform said it had reached an agreement with Crypto.com to offer a suite of \u201cAmerica-First\u201d investment funds.",
      "The exchange-traded funds will hold bitcoin and other digital assets, along with what TMTG called \u201csecurities with a Made in America focus spanning diverse industries such as energy.\u201d Crypto.com will support the backend technology, provide custody and supply the cryptocurrencies for the ETFs, which will operate under TMTG\u2019s Truth.Fi brand.",
      "Tesla rose 3.4% after drifting between modest gains and losses following more grim sales figures from Europe. Its stock nevertheless remains down nearly 29% for 2025 so far.",
      "In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 60 cents to $69.60 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 63 cents at $73.02 per barrel.",

      "A three-row SUV is ideal for car shoppers who need extra space for transporting lots of people and plenty of cargo",
      "A three-row crossover SUV can be a great choice for car shoppers who need extra room to shuttle plenty of people and cargo. The latest models are impressively capable and come loaded with up-to-date technology features. But they\u2019re also expensive and potentially out of reach for many shoppers. You\u2019re looking at spending approximately $50,000 to get a well-equipped new three-row SUV.",
      "This is why the automotive experts at Edmunds have compiled five of the best used three-row SUVs that come without the eye-widening price tag. Using a variety of online search portals, Edmunds tracked down 3-year-old vehicles that you can easily get for under $30,000.",
      "Some of the most popular three-row SUVs will be out of reach when you aim to stay below the $30,000 cap and find a vehicle that\u2019s only a few years old. But the five used three-row SUVs featured here are all nicely equipped and should provide years of dutiful service. The following prices are approximate based on vehicles listed for sale on Edmunds.",
      "The 2022 Chevrolet Traverse is a spacious and family-friendly midsize SUV, prioritizing comfort and practicality. Its generous passenger and cargo space makes it ideal for road trips and hauling duties. Powered by a V6 producing 310 horsepower, the Traverse delivers adequate acceleration for everyday driving. The EPA estimates the Traverse gets up to 21 mpg in combined city/highway driving.",
      "Inside, the Traverse offers a straightforward and user-friendly layout. The third row is notably more accommodating than many in its class. Cargo capacity behind the third row is also a strong point. However, the Traverse can seem a bit unwieldy to drive, and the thick rear roof pillars can block your view out of the back.",
      "2022 Chevrolet Traverse average price: $28,300",
      "The Sorento benefits from a 2021 redesign that brought new styling and a roomier interior. A punchy 281-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder is available, but finding a Sorento that\u2019s equipped with it for a sub-$30,000 budget could be difficult. The standard 191-horsepower four-cylinder gets the job done and gets up to an EPA-estimated 26 mpg combined.",
      "Edmunds noted that the Sorento has impressive interior space. There is adult-friendly legroom in both the second and third rows. Another feather in the cap of the Sorento is a fantastic 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, which provides extra peace of mind for used-SUV shoppers.",
      "2022 Kia Sorento average price: $28,500",
      "The CX-9 is a rare midsize SUV that is equal parts practical and fun to drive. Edmunds praises the CX-9 for its athletic handling and the lively acceleration from its 227-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder. Starting with the 2022 model year, Mazda made all-wheel drive standard. Fuel economy is an EPA-estimated 23 mpg.",
      "If you covered the badge on the steering wheel, the interior could fool you into thinking you\u2019d climbed aboard a luxury SUV. All controls are within easy reach and the materials used are top-notch. Life in the third row, unfortunately, isn\u2019t quite as opulent. Space back there is on the smallish side for a midsize SUV.",
      "2022 Mazda CX-9 average price: $28,400",
      "Until a complete redesign for the 2022 model year, the Outlander had been an SUV also-ran. This latest Outlander has plenty of underlying substance to match its bold style. For example, most Outlanders come with an 8-inch touchscreen with smartphone compatibility, rear cross-traffic alert, and a power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat. Edmunds found the Outlander to be comfortable and smooth to drive during testing.",
      "Acceleration is slow from the 181-horsepower four-cylinder, but you do get up to an EPA-estimated 27 mpg in combined driving. Edmunds noted the third row is small and best suited for kids. Yet, since so few small SUVs have this extra seating, having it still gives the Outlander an advantage over many rivals.",
      "2022 Mitsubishi Outlander average price: $24,800",
      "The 2022 Volkswagen Atlas prioritizes interior space and practicality, making it a strong contender for families needing a roomy three-row SUV. Highlights include lots of cargo space, a third-row seat big enough for adults, and a smooth ride over bumps. An easy-to-use infotainment system and helpful driver aids are also part of the Atlas\u2019 appeal.",
      "Power comes from either a 235-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder or an available 276-horsepower V6. We recommend getting the more satisfying V6 if you can. The EPA estimates the V6 gets up to 20 mpg combined.",
      "2022 Volkswagen Atlas average price: $29,600",
      "As these five vehicles prove, staying under a $30,000 budget isn\u2019t an impossible task when searching for a well-equipped and lightly used SUV. Some are more generous in terms of third-row space than others, so consider climbing back there an essential part of any test drive.",

      "That amount goes well beyond estimates of state legislative researchers as the bill worked its way through the General Assembly that enacted it in 2023. They had projected tax revenues could reach $100 million annually within five years. The calculation is based on the law's 18% rate upon gross wagering revenue, which is essentially betting revenue minus paid winnings.",

      "Point Roberts, Washington, is the rare U.S. exclave so dependent on Canada\u2019s goodwill that the strain of Trump\u2019s tariff war is inescapable \u2014 in the grocery store, at the pub and for the majority of residents who never voted for the president",
      "POINT ROBERTS, Wash. -- In the northwest corner of Washington state lies a quirky U.S. exclave so dependent on Canada\u2019s goodwill that the strain of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war is inescapable \u2014 in the sole grocery store, at any of the three eateries, and for the many residents who never voted for him.",
      "Locals and visitors alike in Point Roberts, Washington, are increasingly worried about how this unusual waterfront border town that has embodied the two countries\u2019 interdependency can survive the hostility brewing on both sides.",
      "\u201cThis was really devastating,\u201d said Tamra Hansen, a longtime Point Roberts resident and business owner whose eyes welled with tears as she described her two restaurants on the brink. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the support from the Canadians, this town will die.\u201d",
      "Known as a geographic oddity since the boundary with Canada was drawn in 1846, this detached 5-square-mile community \u2014 called an exclave because it\u2019s completely separated from mainland America \u2014 is surrounded by water on three sides. Its only land connection is to Canada and it takes one border crossing and about 25 miles north by car to get to downtown Vancouver, B.C.; or two border crossings and about 25 miles through Canada to re-enter the United States along Boundary Bay.",
      "The beaches, marina, golf course and hiking trails have long made Point Roberts a cherished getaway destination, but today locals say business has never been worse. Canadian visitors are staying away and some American residents say they\u2019ve even been harassed over their nationality.",
      "Point Roberts Fire Chief Christopher Carleton said Point Roberts is one the last remaining untouched natural gems of the United States, but the tight-knit community with no stop lights is now under threat by politicians who know nothing about their way of life.",
      "\u201cWe need to take care of one another and have grace for one another and not allow people who don\u2019t even know we exist to disrupt the relationships we currently have,\u201d said Carleton, whose firefighters mostly live across the border.",
      "Tensions between the U.S. and Canada have spiked to a level not seen before in modern times thanks to Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again threat over the past two months to place taxes on a long list of goods going across the border. In response, Canada has promised retaliatory tariffs.",
      "For a population that has famously prided itself on being nice, polite and loyal allies, Canadians aren\u2019t hiding their disgust for Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, especially taking offense with the U.S. president\u2019s claim that Canada could be the \u201c 51st state.\u201d",
      "Mark Nykolaichuk said he refuses to go to the mainland U.S. but describes Point Roberts as a unique exception because the border here has never felt like an actual divide for Canadians like him who grew up visiting.",
      "Most of the property owners here are from Canada, and many of the 1,000 year-round residents have dual citizenship. Once a booming fishing town, the leading industry now, according to U.S. Census data, is retail \u2014 primarily driven from tourism because of the number of vacation properties. The unincorporated Whatcom County community is now mostly home to retirees, though this year there are seven students \u2014 nicknamed \u201cThe Borderites\" \u2014 at the lone public school.",
      "Nykolaichuk, who lives in the Vancouver, B.C. area, said he hopes he can help keep the Point Roberts International Marketplace open by shopping there, given that management reports business is down 20% to 30%. He depends on Point Roberts\u2019 only grocery store to be able to cook at his vacation home because U.S. customs doesn\u2019t permit raw meat to enter its borders, for example, so he must buy it in town.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to see this place shut down,\u201d Nykolaichuk said. \u201cIf this place goes, where are the U.S. citizens going to eat? Where are they going to get their food from?\u201d",
      "Many in Point Roberts don\u2019t blame the Canadians for their disdain over Trump\u2019s perceived sovereignty threat. Instead, there\u2019s a deep sadness for both sides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always gotten along and it\u2019s just nonsensical because now the U.S. is going to suffer too,\u201d said Hansen, who is a dual citizen. \u201cI definitely feel for the Canadian people at this time because they\u2019ve got their backs against the wall, really, and they have to retaliate.\u201d",
      "Like many locals, Larry Musselwhite, owner of Larry\u2019s Liquor Locker, is angry at Trump and blames the president for Point Roberts\u2019 economic problems. The 75-year-old said he can\u2019t even think about retiring right now because of the economy. His liquor store was down 40% in sales last month.",
      "\u201cThis is because of our elected president, who really doesn\u2019t care about the common man and the struggles that we have to go through,\u201d Musselwhite said. \u201cIt greatly affects how I live my life.\u201d",
      "About 75% of the Point Roberts precinct voted for a presidential candidate other than Trump, which is a higher percentage than across Whatcom County as well as the statewide turnout, according to the 2024 election results.",
      "Locals say one of the most frustrating things about the tit-for-tat is the way that the tariffs have abruptly started and stopped, creating an unsteady flow of changes to customs. The whiplash for residents who often cross the border multiple times a day leaves them unsure whether or when they\u2019ll be surprised with a new penalty.",
      "This fear over unexpected tariff fees has made people cautious about buying things in Point Roberts \u2014 if they\u2019re coming into town at all.",
      "Hugh Wilson, a real estate agent who also manages several local Airbnb listings, said properties have seen more cancellations than bookings lately.",
      "\u201cNobody is sure of the rules at any one day here,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe border agents do the best they can to stay up to date and they relay that to us as normal people crossing the border.\u201d",
      "With no end in sight, there\u2019s also a high-stakes fear that the dispute could escalate with Canada possibly imposing tariffs on the water and electricity that it supplies to Point Roberts, or even turning off the utilities altogether.",
      "\u201cIf it gets more brutal, they can cut off the water just like that, or the power,\u201d said Brian Calder, a fourth-generation resident who was previously the president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd it just depends how much more confrontation is fomented by Trump\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Calder said he and other town leaders are trying to plead for help with the British Columbia premier and the governor of Washington state. He said the local Whatcom County leadership has all but abandoned this far-away community in a time of crisis.",
      "Jed Holmes, a spokesman for the county, said they are communicating with Washington state's congressional delegation in D.C. to address the rapid deterioration in U.S.-Canada relations that has especially affected Point Roberts.",
      "\u201cI understand that folks want us to do more, but it\u2019s really challenging to identify what meaningful things a county government can do to change this dynamic at the international level,\u201d Holmes said in an email.",
      "For Hansen, she\u2019s asking herself how much more can she afford to lose personally while running the Saltwater Cafe breakfast spot and a restaurant called The Pier. She has 15 employees to pay but business was down 55% in February compared with last year. There have been times when her pub doesn\u2019t even net $100 a day.",
      "\u201cThere are some businesses that are going out of business right now as we speak,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional for me because I care about everybody that lives here.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Raised in Moscow within the Soviet sports system by parents who were accomplished athletes, Alex Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed at hockey and along the way showed he didn\u2019t need special treatment",
      "Alex Ovechkin almost stopped playing hockey.",
      "His mother, Tatyana, was a basketball player, his father, Mikhail, was a soccer player and they were traveling with their teams, leaving no one to take young Alex to practice. Coach Vyacheslav Kirillov begged Tatyana to get him back in the sport until she gave in.",
      "Good thing, too. When Ovechkin was 12 and playing in a competitive Moscow youth league. he realized he needed three goals to break a record set by Pavel Bure. He scored six times the next game.",
      "A few years later, other parents thought putting Ovechkin on the first line with Dynamo was favoritism because his parents worked for the club, so Tatyana asked the coach to demote him. He made the fourth line the team's best.",
      "Raised in the final years of the Soviet sports system by parents who were already accomplished athletes, Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed and, along the way, showed he didn't need special treatment. He evolved into a superstar on the ice and the top NHL draft pick by the Washington Capitals in 2004.",
      "Over the past 20 years, he became a Stanley Cup champion who celebrated by swimming in fountains \u2014 he has long been known as a fun-loving person \u2014 and teammates watched him develop into a husband, father and a generous person paying for dinners on the road and growing reflective on his career and accomplishments. Next on that list will be breaking Wayne Gretzky's career goals record.",
      "\u201cHe was a very, very bright young man in terms of his goal-setting for his life,\" said Hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov, who met Ovechkin as a teenager. \"He was determined. He was one of the fastest players on the ice, and he had a purpose. Every time he stepped on the ice, he was going to be the best.\"",
      "Born Sept. 17, 1985, and coming of age just as the Soviet Union was giving way to a new Russia, Ovechkin was drawn to the game through his father. If Mikhail's gifts had a bigger impact, his son might have been more like goaltender Vladislav Tretiak than a power forward and pure scorer.",
      "\"He would go on some trips and bring me some goalie helmets,\" Ovechkin once recalled. \"I didn\u2019t know what it was, except it was something about hockey, and when I was a little kid everything was about hockey, hockey, hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin embraced hockey and showed he was good at it. When marketing executive Steven Warshaw went to Moscow in the 1990s to work for the Pittsburgh Penguins after they invested in a team there, he heard all about the next generation of Russian stars.",
      "\u201cThey give them everything they can -- the best coaching, the best everything,\u201d Warshaw said. \u201cHe was definitely given a jump start as all great athletes are, especially when you have the lineage.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was 14 when Larionov, by that time already a three-time Cup champion, sat with him in the locker room and shared some advice about doing extra summer training and committing to training in the gym.",
      "\u201cHe knew at home from the parents, from mom and dad, to be successful you have to be determined to do extra things off ice, on ice and follow the right steps,\u201d Larionov said. \"It\u2019s synergy between genetics from his parents, his approach to the game, his drive, his fire, his power that made him a great player.\u201d",
      "At 17, Ovechkin scored a tournament-best six goals in seven games to help Russia repeat as world junior champions and was again the leading scorer the following year as he emerged as the top prospect in the NHL draft, just ahead of countryman Evgeni Malkin.",
      "The lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season delayed Ovechkin's North American arrival, but on his first shift Ovechkin hit an opponent so hard he dislodged the partition holding the plexiglass together. He also scored career goal No. 1, then goal No. 2 on the way to getting 52 of them and becoming rookie of the year.",
      "\u201cHe was actually making giant, massive steps toward stardom and started scoring goals, got his confidence,\u201d Larionov said. \"The Washington Capitals got the right players around him to kind of fit him and use his biggest strength, power, speed and shot.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the NHL in goals and points in 2008-09, helping the Capitals make the playoffs in his third season and first of three as NHL MVP.",
      "Ovechkin still visits Russia, usually annually, and he has been criticized for his relationship with Vladimir Putin after expressing support for the Russian president in November 2017 ahead of an election. At the time, he told The AP and Washington Post, \u201cI just support my country\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about political stuff.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was surrounded by young talent in his early years in Washington. Center Nicklas Backstrom, defenseman Mike Green and winger Alexander Semin joined and made hockey in the nation's capital must-see entertainment. They were also having plenty of fun off the ice.",
      "\u201cHe should\u2019ve been out having his fun and having a new car every other week,\u201d retired teammate Mike Knuble said. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of like, \u2018Oh, what car\u2019s he driving this week?\u2019 And just having a good, old time doing whatever he wanted to do and just playing hockey and bagging individual awards.\u201d",
      "In a sport that defines players for winning championships, Knuble worried that Ovechkin would be known only for the individual accomplishments because the playoff success wasn't coming. The Capitals went through a series of changes from the front office to the coaching staff and the roster, culminating with Ovechkin leading them to the Stanley Cup in 2018 as playoff MVP.",
      "\u201cHe just didn't want to let it go,\u201d Backstrom said of the Cup.",
      "Even though Ovechkin was 32, he and the Capitals celebrated like few teams in recent history. They famously swam in the Georgetown fountains \u2014 a plaque now marks the spot \u2014 and the entire run showed the best of Ovechkin.",
      "\u201cA big heart like a big kid,\u201d longtime teammate John Carlson said. \u201cHe loves coming to the rink and he loves scoring goals and playing like we did when we were kids.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin changed off the ice, too. He and Nastya Shubskaya married in 2016, and the couple had even more reason to celebrate the summer of 2018 when she gave birth their first son, Sergei, that August. Ilya, was born in the spring of 2020, and the boys have been right there with their dad for many of his big moments since.",
      "When Ovechkin scored his 801st and 802nd goals just before Christmas 2022, to pass Gordie Howe for second on the all-time list, he walked into the locker room hand-in-hand with Sergei and Ilya and put them on his lap to take photos.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, you have to think about your family, kids first, Nast, me,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt changed 100%.\u201d",
      "At 2023 All-Star Weekend in South Florida, possibly Ovechkin's last appearance at one of those, Sergei joined him on the ice in a matching \u201cOvi Jr.\u201d jersey with, of course, his dad's signature No. 8.",
      "\u201cHe will remember that for all his life,\u201d Ovechkin said.",
      "Knuble has enjoyed seeing Ovi the dad take this in maybe even more than the goal-scorer. Tom Wilson, a teammate since 2013, now a father and likely to succeed Ovechkin as captain, has witnessed the growth firsthand \u2014 joining them for family vacations and seeing him as a family man, playing \u201cDance Dance Revolution\u201d with his nephews and nieces.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Even at home, where Ovechkin enjoys spending time with his wife, kids and their 9-year-old black lab, Blake.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t think about hockey,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t think about the training or practice. You just enjoy your life, enjoy your time with the kids, with family, with friends and you can basically do whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Backstrom met Ovechkin nearly two decades ago before either was 21. The fun times, the Cup win and hundreds of goals between them have come and gone.",
      "\"He\u2019s always been the same,\" Backstrom said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed a lot since the first time I met him: the same kind of outgoing person.\u201d",
      "Former teammate Nate Schmidt called Ovechkin \u201cunapologetically himself.\u201d Marcus Johansson, who played his first seven NHL seasons with Washington and had another stint with the Capitals, said Ovechkin is inviting, has \u201cgot a big heart and he takes care of the people around him.\u201d",
      "That's what current center Dylan Strome tells friends and folks back home when they ask what Ovechkin is like.",
      "\u201cVery, very, very generous with his time, his money \u2014 going out of his way for people,\u201d Strome said. \u201cHe always wants to be with the guys, whether it\u2019s watch sports or just talk or whatever or have a couple beers, he\u2019s always in for that.\u201d",
      "Carlson believes the 39-year-old Ovechkin has stayed young as the age gap between veterans and young teammates in the locker room grows, while at the same time appreciating each moment a little more. Wilson has seen Ovechkin sign dozens of pucks, sticks and jerseys for other teams after a game without the slightest hesitation.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t even really describe him in words,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy that\u2019s bigger than life, bigger than hockey. A personality that whenever he does hang them up, the game will miss him a lot.\u201d",

      "SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Mikaela Shiffrin's flashbacks to her November crash in a giant slalom race are happening less and less when she's training.",
      "For her, as she deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the discipline, that's major progress.",
      "While other racers compete in the GS on Tuesday at World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Shiffrin plans to squeeze in some training in the slalom. It will be the American standout's only event of the weeklong finals after not qualifying in giant slalom.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion revealed last month that she\u2019s suffering from PTSD after falling in the GS on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont. In the crash, something punctured Shiffrin's side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin skipped the giant slalom at world championships and has raced the discipline three times since, with her best showing 25th place.",
      "But she's back to turning in fast sections at practice in the GS, a discipline that blends speed and technical skill.",
      "\u201cTraining is going well. It\u2019s actually super positive. Training has been improving day-by-day,\u201d Shiffrin said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday before signing autographs for fans. \u201cI'm just trying to get back to the confidence that I was skiing with in Killington when the crash happened. That would be a big goal.\u201d",
      "On that day, Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS as she charged after her 100th World Cup win. The finish line was in sight on her final run, when she lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis.",
      "The all-time winningest Alpine World Cup ski racer then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. She still doesn't know what led to the puncture wound.",
      "To help with getting back in the giant slalom start gate, she's been working with a psychologist. Leading into world championships and the GS, she checked most of the boxes for PTSD symptoms. A few weeks later in Are, Sweden, she checked fewer.",
      "\u201cMy processing speed and the mind-body connection has come back in a great way,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who earned her 100th World Cup win last month in Italy. \"But every now and then I\u2019ll still have the sort of intrusive images or thoughts cross my mind of crashing or the pain. Normally, it\u2019s in the start gate. If I\u2019m starting to get a little bit tired in a session, I just imagine everything that could go wrong and it\u2019s kind of an intense reaction.",
      "\u201cBut it happens so much less often now. It does feel very true that simply exposure to doing the thing that\u2019s pretty uncomfortable is helpful.\u201d",
      "Following her slalom training session Tuesday, Shiffrin will be watching as New Zealand\u2019s Alice Robinson tries to hold off Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone for the crystal globe in the giant slalom.",
      "The 30-year-old Shiffrin can see glimpses of her GS form returning. She won an Olympic gold medal in the discipline at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and 22 of her 100 World Cup victories have come in giant slalom.",
      "\u201cSome of my turns are competitive with the fastest in the world,\u201d said Shiffrin, whose slalom race is Thursday. \u201cBut putting that together for a minute and 10-second GS run \u2014 that just takes time and repetition. We\u2019ll need to try to get some days this summer with long course sets, with a lot of variation of course sets, variation of conditions. I don\u2019t doubt that I can get to that competitive level again.",
      "\"I think a lot of my skiing is already there.\u201d",

      "The 34-year-old Brignone entered the day 20 points behind Robinson in the last World Cup giant slalom race of the season. Robinson struggled with a gate in her first run, veered off course and didn't finish, paving the way for Brignone.",
      "Brignone won the GS crystal globe with 580 points, while Robinson had 520 and Hector 447. This was only the second time in Robinson's nine World Cup GS races this season that she wasn't on the podium.",
      "It's been a stellar season for Brignone, who already wrapped up the overall title, along with the downhill crown. She is expected to be a strong force heading into the 2026 Winter Olympics in her home country.",
      "Gut-Behrami, the super-G winner Sunday, continued to shine on this course.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Former UFC champion Cain Velasquez was sentenced to five years in prison Monday for a shooting in 2022 where he chased after the man accused of molesting his son.",
      "Velasquez was sentenced in Santa Clara County after he pled no contest to attempted murder, felony assault, and other related gun charges last August for what the district attorney's office called a \u201cvigilante shooting spree.\u201d He will receive credit for time served.",
      "In February 2022, the two-time UFC heavyweight champion fired a gun multiple times at a truck carrying three people, including 46-year-old Harry Goularte, who is facing felony child molestation charges, according to the district attorney's office.",
      "His defense attorney, Renee Hessling, called the result \u201cbittersweet\u201d as they had hoped to keep Velasquez out of prison.",
      "\u201cThroughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,\" Hessling said in a statement. \u201cHe has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.\u201d",
      "Less than a week prior to the shooting, Goularte was arrested in connection to the sexual assault of a 4-year-old at the daycare owned by his family. He was released without bail a few days later. Officials said he was released under house arrest and was on his way to retrieve an electronic monitoring bracelet when Velasquez attacked.",
      "Velasquez shot at Goularte's truck in a car chase that lasted for 11 miles (17.7 kilometers), the district attorney\u2019s office said. Goularte was uninjured, but his stepfather, who was driving, was hit twice.",
      "Velasquez has said the sexual assault incident involved his child and is suing Goularte and his family\u2019s daycare for negligence and sexual battery.",
      "On his former teammate Kyle Kingsbury's podcast, Velasquez said the way he handled the situation was \u201cnot the way to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot put the law in our own hands,\" Velasquez said. \"I know what I did, and I know what I did was very dangerous to other people, you know? Not just to people involved, but innocent people. I understand what I did and I\u2019m willing to do everything I have to, to pay that back.\u201d",
      "Velasquez also said it was important to have open and honest with your kids about what kind of behavior is acceptable and listen to what they say.",
      "\u201cOne man\u2019s decision to take the law into his own hands left an innocent man wounded and endangered schoolchildren, teachers, and many others in our community,\" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. \"If you want to do justice in Santa Clara County, please apply for a badge.\u201d",

      "Duke guard Tyrese Proctor has made 13 of 16 3-pointers through two games of the NCAA Tournament",
      "It wasn't that long ago that Tyrese Proctor was struggling to make much of anything outside the arc. Shot after shot clanged away in a befuddling stretch of misses spanning nearly a month of the stretch run for Duke's national-title contender.",
      "Now he can't miss.",
      "The junior guard has been on an absolute tear with his outside shot, hitting at least six 3-pointers for the past three games going back to the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament final. It's been a boost to an offense already humming at elite efficiency as the top-seeded Blue Devils head into Thursday's matchup with Arizona in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament's East Region in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI think the main thing is the mentality of it,\" Proctor said after Sunday's second-round win against Baylor. \"I'm just shooting knowing the ball is going to go in and not hoping it's going in as the big thing.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 guard from Australia has made 19 of 28 3-pointers (67.9%) since missing his first two attempts in the ACC title-game win against Louisville. And he's only gotten hotter with each passing possession.",
      "First came a 6-for-8 output in the first round against Mount St. Mary's \u2014 the kind of shooting display that's typically more of a one-game blip than a sustained push.",
      "Only he topped that two days later, making 7 of 8 against the Bears.",
      "That's 13 for 16 through two March Madness games, a shocking 81.3% hit rate. The 13 made 3s are the most of any player in the Sweet 16, with Houston's LJ Cryer and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier each hitting 10 as the only other players to reach double figures so far.",
      "And Proctor is striking from a variety of ways: on the catch in transition, curling around a screen, using a stepback, even pump-faking a defender off his feet and then resetting off a single dribble to his right \u2014 a move he pulled three times to send a Baylor player flying by on Sunday.",
      "As he kept burying the Bears, he flashed triumphant gestures and unleashed I'm-feeling-it screams toward a home-state crowd as he retreated back to the defensive end.",
      "\u201cSuch a talented player, such a weapon for us when he\u2019s being confident looking for his shot,\u201d freshman star Cooper Flagg said.",
      "The Blue Devils (33-3) have long counted on Proctor as a starter with perimeter length, giving him the ability to create matchup problems at both ends for smaller guards. He has long been a complementary scorer behind Flagg and another freshman in Kon Knueppel, and was averaging 11.8 points entering the Louisville game.",
      "But his kicked-up offense behind that 3-point shot through the last three games has increased his scoring average by approaching a full point (12.5).",
      "It was hard to see this coming as recently as 10 days ago.",
      "After a strong start to February, Proctor's outside shot suddenly abandoned him. Over the next seven games, he would miss 23 of 29 3-pointers, including a pair of 0-for-5 days to start the ACC Tournament. By the time he missed his first two against Louisville in the final, Proctor had missed 14 straight 3s going back to missing his last two in the regular-season finale at rival North Carolina.",
      "Proctor spent time looking at film of his shot with assistant Will Avery after the first two games of the ACCs, trying to decipher where things were misfiring.",
      "\u201cIt's just little things \u2014 just my balance and stuff like that,\" Proctor said. \"At the end of the day, it's just confidence. As soon as my feet get set and I hold my follow-through, I'm just going to keep trusting it.",
      "\"All the 0-for, whatever it was, all that felt good. A couple of them I knew what I did wrong. I think it's just realizing and understanding that, and just fixing it on the fly is a big thing.\u201d",
      "It's a challenge any shooter can understand: finding a delicate balance of tweaking any deficiencies showing up in the form, yet not meddling too much with what has worked for so long.",
      "So far it's working.",
      "\u201cIt's hard, earlier this season I struggled with that,\" Knueppel said. \u201cYou've just got to keep shooting it, that's the only way you can make more shots, is you keep shooting them. So he's done a great job of just being confident. He's really attacking his catches and getting locked and loaded, and ready to go.\u201d",

      "Tests are underway at Cortina\u2019s controversial Olympic sliding track",
      "ROME -- When Italian skeleton competitor Mattia Gaspari became the first athlete to test the controversial sliding track for next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, he did so in a sort of tunnel under a temporary roof built of wooden beams and white plastic paper.",
      "That's because the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo is still under construction and the only part that is really finished is the track structure.",
      "Still, getting to this point little more than a year after construction began is a big achievement for the Italian government, which rebuilt the century-old track despite calls from the International Olympic Committee to hold bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes at a venue in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite an adventure,\u201d Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the construction firm, which was the first one to believe in this, and the journalists who motivated us,\u201d said Salvini, who is also the deputy premier, citing articles claiming that the project would never be done. \u201cWell, here we are.\u201d",
      "Olympic bronze medalist Dominik Fischnaller was the second athlete down the track on his luge before Simone Bertazzo and Eric Fantazzini made a two-man bobsled run.",
      "Simico, the government agency in charge of the 118 million euro ($128 million) project, reported positive results for the test runs. But it will be officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation and the IOC to determine whether to bestow preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track.",
      "Preliminary approval would be a big step in avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time. Lake Placid officials were hopeful that, if the sliding events were going to be awarded to the U.S., the official word would come by the end of March.",
      "Construction on the Cortina track began in February last year. The pre-homologation plan calls for athletes to begin their initial runs from the junior start, well below the ramps from where they would begin to race for World Cup and Olympic competitions. Sliders would move up the track slowly throughout the coming days.",
      "There are testing events at the Cortina track for all three sliding sports \u2014 bobsled, skeleton and luge \u2014 scheduled for throughout the fall. Those are important so that sliders can familiarize themselves with the track and feel safe there when competing at the Olympics. Safety has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Luge athletes are scheduled to have an international training period at the new track from Oct. 27 through Nov. 2, then return for a test event there in the final week of November. The bobsled and skeleton tours will hold their international training period from Nov. 7-16, followed by the season-opening World Cup races there from Nov. 17-23.",
      "The 1.749-kilometer (1.09-mile) track features 16 curves with an estimated top speed of 145 kph (90 mph) with run times slated for 55-60 seconds.",
      "Athletes from 12 nations are involved in the tests this week. It's about 60 athletes in all, about half of them being Italian sliders. Coaches representing at least 23 different sliding nations were also invited to view this week's events.",

      "Lamont Butler doesn\u2019t want to settle for just one shining moment on a Final Four stage",
      "Lamont Butler doesn\u2019t want to settle for just one shining moment on a Final Four stage.",
      "The guy who made the buzzer beater to send San Diego State to the 2023 NCAA Tournament championship game is confident he can get back there as a fifth-year senior with Kentucky.",
      "He has his new teammates believing that as well heading into No. 3 seed Kentucky\u2019s Midwest Region semifinal matchup with No. 2 seed Tennessee (29-7) on Friday in Indianapolis.",
      "\u201cI will say from day one our focus was winning a national championship,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThe expectation here at Kentucky is to win. And we\u2019ve got a bunch of winners here, and we want to continue that tradition.\u201d",
      "This Kentucky team is a little different from any other in its storied history, which is why Butler\u2019s tournament experience with San Diego State has been so essentially.",
      "Kentucky (24-11) didn\u2019t return a single player who scored a point for the Wildcats last season. New coach Mark Pope essentially built a roster from scratch. Nine transfers had to get accustomed to playing together.",
      "Butler emerged as the leader of the group. Kentucky teammate Andrew Carr referenced it before the tournament when he jokingly referred to Butler as \u201cLaMarch.\u201d",
      "The Wildcats look up to him in part because they know what he\u2019s accomplished. The 6-foot-2 guard is making his fifth straight tournament appearance. His jumper as time expired in a 2023 NCAA semifinal gave San Diego State a 72-71 victory over Florida Atlantic, sending the Aztecs into a championship game they lost to UConn.",
      "\u201cMost of us talk about what happened to us,\u201d Pope said. \u201cWe talk about what happened to us. And champions, winners talk about what they made happen. It\u2019s just the truth. It\u2019s true.",
      "\u201cLamont Butler is spending his whole lifetime talking about what he makes happen, and that\u2019s a champion\u2019s heart. And he doesn\u2019t spend any time talking about what happened to him. He talks about all the stuff he makes happen. When you have a guy like that leading your crew like that, it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",
      "Pope related a story from last summer when he was on the road recruiting and the team had planned something for a player who was going through a difficult family situation: \u201cI called in to check with that player and see how the day went, and he had scrapped all the plans because Lamont scooped him up and they spent the day together. And Lamont did that because that\u2019s who he is. He cares.\u201d",
      "Butler said he knew even around that time that this Kentucky team was capable of putting together a run similar to the one his San Diego State team made two years ago - and perhaps doing even more.",
      "\u201cI kind of expected us to be in a good position from the summer to go win a national championship,\u201d Butler said prior to the NCAA Tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s on our mind. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d",
      "Butler is averaging 11.1 points and 4.3 assists \u2013 career highs in both categories \u2013 despite dealing with a left shoulder injury dating to mid-January that cost him six games. He hurt it again in the Southeastern Conference Tournament and didn\u2019t play in a quarterfinal loss to Alabama.",
      "Butler returned for a 76-57 first-round NCAA victory over Troy and didn\u2019t score at all, but he still contributed in so many other ways that he had a plus-minus rating of plus-22. Butler, who has been wearing a brace on the shoulder, had 14 points and five assists in an 84-75 second-round triumph over Illinois.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really a dog,\u201d Kentucky guard Otega Oweh said. \u201cGoing out there with one arm and giving it his all. He\u2019s playing defense, and on top of that, he\u2019s getting us into our offense. When you have someone that\u2019s doing that, it just trickles down. You just want to out there and fight for him, too.\u201d",
      "Butler had three of Kentucky\u2019s 14 steals against Illinois. After the game, Kentucky guard Koby Brea had a simple explanation for why the Wildcats were able to force Illinois into so many turnovers.",
      "\u201cWe have Lamont Butler as the head of defense,\u201d Brea said. \u201cSo I feel like for any team, when you see him pick you up, it has to put something in your stomach, some nerves or something.\u201d",
      "Butler scares his opponents while calming his teammates. He\u2019s providing the presence this team full of transfers needed as they try to get Kentucky back to the Final Four for the first time in a decade.",
      "\u201cI think everybody is hungry this year,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI feel like a lot of us came from smaller schools or different places and we were able to compete at one of the best schools ever. We all wanted to be remembered here.\u201d",
      "Butler already was going to be remembered for that shot he hit two years ago. Now he\u2019s creating a whole new set of memories while wearing a different uniform.",

      "The NFL competition committee is recommending making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and moving touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The competition committee released several potential rule changes for 2025 on Wednesday, including an expansion of instant replay that will be considered next week at the league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida. Any rule change must be approved by 24 out of 32 team owners.",
      "Teams submitted several proposals last week that also could be voted on at the league meetings, including banning the \u201ctush push\u201d and changing playoff seeding rules.",
      "Owners approved a major change to the kickoff last year on a one-year trial basis and the committee recommended another change to increase the rate of returns without increasing the risk of injuries. The league had 332 additional returns last season with the rate increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season.",
      "The committee hopes that moving the touchback on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35 will incentivize kicking teams to opt for shorter kicks that lead to more returns.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing teams to declare their intention for an onside kick at any point in the game when they are trailing instead of only in the fourth quarter.",
      "The committee proposed a few other tweaks to how players on the return team can align before the kick but the basics will remain the same with the kicker lining up at his own 35, the 10 coverage players at the 40, and at least nine blockers lined up in the \u201csetup zone\u201d between the 30- and 35-yard line and up to two returners in the landing zone inside the 20.",
      "Any kick that reaches the end zone in the air can be returned, or the receiving team can opt for a touchback, which now will be at the 35.",
      "Only the kicker and two returners are allowed to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20.",
      "According to the NFL, there were 59 returns of at least 40 yards last season, the most in the league since 2016, and seven TD returns. The concussion rate fell 43% from the previous three years and there were the fewest lower-extremity strains on kick return plays since 2018.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn't occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing two players to be designated to return from injured reserve if they are placed on IR when rosters are reduced to 53, granting playoff teams two more return from IR spots in the postseason, and using point differential as the third tiebreaker on waiver claims.",

      "There almost certainly won\u2019t be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball\u2019s next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters",
      "There almost certainly won't be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball's next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters.",
      "Still, plenty of talented players are going into their final seasons before potentially becoming free agents for the first time.",
      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr., five-tool player Kyle Tucker and starting pitchers Dylan Cease, Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen could all become available to other teams after this season. Three-time batting champion Luis Arr\u00e1ez and Bo Bichette, who twice led the American League in hits, could also be first-time free agents.",
      "Guerrero, like Soto already a four-time All-Star and Home Run Derby champion at age 26, had set a self-imposed deadline for negotiating a long-term agreement with Toronto. That passed at the start of spring training without a new deal, when he said he wanted to stay but would listen to other teams in free agency.",
      "Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro remained optimistic going into the season that the team would eventually sign the first baseman to a contract extension.",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in December came after Ohtani got a $700 million, 10-year deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers the previous offseason. Guerrero told ESPN in an interview after his deadline passed that he was seeking a similar contract length as Soto but noted that his last offer was for less than $600 million.",
      "Here are some of the players eligible for free agency after this year\u2019s World Series:",
      "Guerrero, who will make $28.5 million this season, hit a career-best .323 last year with a .940 OPS, 30 homers and 103 RBIs in his fourth consecutive All-Star season. Over six seasons with the Blue Jays, he has a .288 average with 160 homers and 507 RBIs in 819 games. He finished second in the 2021 AL MVP voting behind unanimous choice Ohtani.",
      "Houston clearly wasn't planning to pay the price to keep Tucker in free agency, so the Astros traded the three-time All-Star and Gold Glove-winning right fielder to Chicago in December for a third baseman, starting pitcher and top prospect outfielder that are all under team control for multiple seasons. The 28-year-old Tucker was limited to 78 games last year because of a fractured right shin, and still hit 23 homers. He had a combined 59 homers, 219 RBIs and 55 stolen bases in 2022-23.",
      "The 29-year-old Cease has 130 starts over the last four seasons, twice finishing in the top four in Cy Young Award voting. He was the AL runner-up behind unanimous winner Justin Verlander while with White Sox in 2022, and fourth in the NL last year when 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts after being traded to the playoff-bound Padres during spring training from a Chicago team that went on to lose 121 games. Cease has 1,016 career strikeouts in 847 1/3 innings.",
      "One of the game's best left-handed starters, the 31-year-old Valdez has a 68-41 career record and is Houston's opening-day starter for the fourth year in a row. He was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA in 28 games last season, his fifth in a row to finish with a winning record. The workhorse threw a no-hitter in 2023 and averaged more than 191 innings the past three years.",
      "The 29-year-old Gallen, 14-6 last year, is 43-19 with a 3.20 ERA in 93 starts the past three seasons. Arizona got him his rookie season in 2019 when it traded Jazz Chisholm Jr. to Miami. The Diamondbacks just gave 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes a $210 million, six-year deal, the richest in franchise history. That could significantly impact whether they will also be able to keep Gallen, twice a top-five finisher in Cy Young voting.",
      "Arr\u00e1ez has back-to-back 200-hit seasons, part of three batting titles in a row while finishing each of those seasons with a different team. The Padres acquired him last year in a midseason trade from Miami, which got him from Minnesota after his first batting title with the Twins in 2022. He goes into this season with a .323 career average and only 194 strikeouts in 2,858 career plate appearances.",
      "A calf injury and then a broken right middle finger limited Bichette to 81 games last season, and the 27-year-old two-time All-Star hit a career-low .225 with only four homers. Before that, he led the AL in hits in 2021 and 2022, and batted .306 in 2023 during his third consecutive 20-homer season.",
      "Ozuna, who turns 35 next November, played in all 162 games for the first time last year and was an All-Star for the third time \u2014 first since 2016. He has 79 homers and 204 RBIs over the past two years.",
      "Bieber had 20 strikeouts in 12 scoreless innings last season before Tommy John surgery and becoming a free agent for the first time. Cleveland re-signed the 2020 AL Cy Young winner even though he won\u2019t pitch until later this season, during which the pitcher with a 62-32 career record turns 30. He does have a $16 million player option for 2026.",
      "34-year-old catcher J.T. Realmuto, 32-year-old slugger Kyle Schwarber and 29-year-old left-handed starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez are going into the final seasons of their contracts with the Phillies after being key figures for three consecutive playoff seasons. That began with that 2022 NL pennant that ended a decade-long postseason drought. Schwarber has 131 homers and 302 RBIs in that three-season span, along with 318 walks and 612 strikeouts.",

      "MIAMI -- Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat will be linked one last time.",
      "And then, they\u2019ll be on opposite sides \u2014 just like they were in his final weeks as a member of the team.",
      "The Heat will pay tribute to Butler\u2019s 5\u00bd seasons with the team with a pregame video on Tuesday night, one that will be shown in the arena as part of the introduction of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 starting lineup for the game.",
      "Butler said he\u2019ll watch the video, though added that it didn\u2019t matter to him whether the Heat did one or not. He\u2019s insisting that there\u2019s no hard feelings now, a month and a half after he was traded to the Warriors following a contentious breakup that saw him suspended by Miami three times in his final weeks with the team.",
      "He wasn\u2019t happy with the Heat, not getting an extension and had issues with his role. The Heat weren\u2019t happy with how he missed about 25% of their games during his tenure with the club and how he took his complaints public in the final months.",
      "Butler got his extension \u2014 two years, $111 million \u2014 from the Warriors, and Golden State was 16-3 in his first 19 appearances with the team entering Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always painted as the bad guy,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve always been a problem. We\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t got nothing to say. I\u2019m not mad at being a bad guy. It\u2019s all the way everything\u2019s portrayed. Some people talk to the media, some people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been one to tell my side of the story to almost anybody. Let everybody think that this is what happened. We\u2019ll ride with it.\u201d",
      "Fans, as they tend to be when a top player leaves their team, have not been shy about hiding their anger with Butler on social media. Butler knows things didn\u2019t end well in his Miami tenure, though notes that he believes there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around for the messy breakup.",
      "\u201cI wonder if they look at the Heat the same way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like I was the one who was doing everything. It\u2019s got to be 50-50, maybe 51-49 \u2014 49 towards them, 51 towards me. But there\u2019s no way that I was the cause of all of this.\u201d",
      "Butler wound up being suspended for a total of 14 Heat games before the trade. But the Heat have a tradition of welcoming back players who were All-Stars or champions with the team; Butler was an All-Star in Miami who led the team to three Eastern Conference finals berths and two trips to the NBA Finals.",

There weren't any major upsets or Cinderella stories heading into the second week of the women's NCAA Tournament. For the first time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams, no team seeded 11th or lower advanced out the first round.",

      "Bueckers, who is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft, played her final game at home and put on a show, tying her career high with 34 points. Hidalgo has helped Notre Dame regain its dominant form after the Irish slumped at the end of the regular season and conference tournament.",

      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have had the same swing coach since they were about 8. Hovland has made 11 coaching changes since leaving Oklahoma State in 2019, some of them brought back on more than one occasion.",
      "What hasn't changed is his mission \u2014 to hit pure shots \u2014 no matter how many detours.",
      "Hovland reached what looked like the summit in August 2023 when he had a 65-61 weekend at Olympia Fields to win the BMW Championship, and then a 66-63 weekend at East Lake to win the Tour Championship and capture the FedEx Cup. He went 3-1-1 at the Ryder Cup, including partnering with Ludvig Aberg for a 9-and-7 win over Scheffler and Brooks Koepka.",
      "He returned from a winter's break in Norway and felt lost again.",
      "It was at Bay Hill a year ago when Hovland was asked the difference between winning without his best stuff or hitting it great and finishing fifth.",
      "\u201cI guess that\u2019s kind of the insane part of my brain is that I just enjoy flushing a golf shot,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re out here to compete and win tournaments. But I really just cherish being able to hit the shots exactly the way I want to. I think it\u2019s a better predictor of how you\u2019re going to play in the future.\u201d",
      "Therein lies the secret. He can win without his best stuff because he's very good. What he lacks is consistently strong finishes. He has never gone more than five straight tournaments in the top 10, which pales compared with the elite in the game.",
      "But he can contend out of nowhere, such as his third place in the PGA Championship last year at Valhalla when he wondered why he even bothered showing up. That wasn't a threat, more a state of his mind. He also was runner-up at a FedEx Cup playoff event last year.",
      "He doesn't doubt his ability, only what he has referred to as the \u201cmachinery.\u201d",
      "Perfection in golf is something to chase, not attain. That's why Hovland was amused at the label of being a perfectionist.",
      "\u201cI guess you can use that word to describe it,\u201d he said. \"I just view it as if you put your heart and soul into doing something, you might as well do it right. I\u2019ve swung the club extremely well and I think my ball striking has been really, really good over a long period of time. And then when it\u2019s not doing that, I\u2019m going to work on that, I\u2019m going to figure it out.",
      "\u201cI find it kind of weird that we\u2019re professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, \u2018Oh he\u2019s a perfectionist, he\u2019s out on the perimeter searching too much.\u2019 That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments.\"",
      "That's worked out just fine for Bryson DeChambeau, renowned for going down rabbit holes and leaving enough bread crumbs to find his way out if needed.",
      "Hovland won with intelligent course management and good fortune. He could feel the club being out of position at the top, forcing him to try to save it on the way down. The timing worked in his favor at Innisbrook, particularly that 7-iron to 5 feet on the 16th hole Sunday.",
      "And so the trophy from the Valspar Championship is in hand \u2014 his 11th worldwide \u2014 and the search continues. He is back with Grant Waite (for the second time), and the immediate goal is to be ready for the Masters. He\u2019s not sure the swing he had at Innisbrook will work at Augusta National.",
      "The chase continues, with no apologies.",
      "\u201cWhen you're struggling with something, it's just problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd problems are usually a lack of information. I would encourage people to go out and seek more information and try it out for yourselves. See if it helps your problems. And if it doesn't, then you've got to seek more answers. And you keep going and keep going.\u201d",

      "STANFORD, Calif. -- Stanford fired football coach Troy Taylor following a report last week that he had been investigated twice for allegedly mistreating staffers.",
      "General manager Andrew Luck announced the decision on Tuesday in his first major move since taking over in his role running the entire football program.",
      "\u201cSince beginning my role as general manager, I have been thoroughly assessing the entire Stanford football program,\u201d Luck said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIt has been clear that certain aspects of the program need change. Additionally, in recent days, there has been significant attention to Stanford investigations in previous years related to coach Taylor. After continued consideration it is evident to me that our program needs a reset. In consultation with university leadership I no longer believe that coach Taylor is the right coach to lead our football program.\u201d",
      "ESPN reported last week that Taylor had been investigated twice since taking over before the 2023 season over allegations of hostile and aggressive behavior, as well as personal attacks, against female staff members.",
      "Both investigations determined that Taylor\u2019s treatment of employees, particularly of women, was inconsistent with Stanford\u2019s standards, according to ESPN.",
      "The second investigation concluded that Taylor retaliated against a compliance staffer who had found seven minor NCAA infractions by \u201cseeking her removal from her assigned duties.\u201d",
      "The report said investigators had never encountered \u201cthis palpable level of animosity and disdain\u201d for a university compliance office, according to ESPN.",
      "Luck thanked Taylor for his time but said it was important to instill the proper culture at Stanford.",
      "\u201cWe have powerful traditions, incredible student-athletes, and a vision for the future that demonstrates our strong potential as a program,\u201d Luck said. \"This vision includes an emphasis on a positive, winning, and inclusive culture. I am confident that we will return Stanford to the top echelon of college football.\u201d",
      "Luck was hired last November to oversee the football program and he reports directly to school President Jonathan Levin. Athletic director Bernard Muir announced last month that he is leaving at the end of the academic year and Stanford is looking for a replacement.",
      "But Luck will be in charge of the football program and now needs to find a coach who can get the Cardinal back to being competitive nationally.",
      "From Luck's first season as starting quarterback in 2009 through the 2018 season, the Cardinal were tied for the sixth most wins in FBS, playing in three Rose Bowls and two other BCS bowls in a 10-year span.",
      "But Stanford is 20-46 in six seasons since then, with its .303 winning percentage ranking second worst to Vanderbilt among all power conference teams in that span.",
      "Taylor was hired after David Shaw stepped down in 2022 after his second straight 3-9 season. Taylor, who had helped build Sacramento State into an FCS power, went 3-9 in each of his two seasons with the Cardinal. Stanford went just 1-10 at home against FBS opponents under Taylor.",

      "AP All-America center Lauren Betts, Ayoka Lee and Sedona Prince are traditional post players, and all have been in the middle of their teams making it to the Sweet 16 in the women's NCAA Tournament.",
      "There just may not be as many players like them in the future with more teams opting for flexible posts who play on the perimeter and shoot 3-pointers. Plus, that is how players are now often being taught at younger ages.",
      "\u201cAll these young ladies are getting more skilled. They\u2019re able to step away from the basket. They are able to face up and play,\u201d Kansas State coach Jeff Mittie said. \u201cI think, as you\u2019re seeing youth basketball progress, that they\u2019re getting more training earlier, where not just to stand in the paint and play. ... The game has evolved.\"",
      "Even so, these women are excelling inside during this March Madness.",
      "The 6-foot-7 Betts had 30 points and 14 rebounds for top-seeded UCLA in a second-round win over Richmond. The junior has made 63.6% of her 825 career field goal attempts over three years, and has a Bruins single-season record 90 blocked shots.",
      "Prince, also 6-7, combined for 35 points and 14 rebounds to help TCU advance past the second round for the first time.",
      "The 6-6 Lee has 33 points and 19 rebounds while playing only 43 minutes combined in K-State\u2019s two tourney games, after missing 12 of the previous 13 games with a foot injury.",
      "Betts, with career averages of 13.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, said it takes more than just having the requisite size to be consistent and successful in the low post.",
      "\u201cPatience has always been my biggest thing,\" said Betts, in her second season at UCLA after one at Stanford. \u201cWhen I\u2019m catching it inside, obviously there (are) a few people running at me at a time, so just making sure I\u2019m not rushing myself.\"",
      "While UCLA coach Cori Close agrees that the game is evolving, the Bruins \u2014 who next play fifth-seeded Ole Miss on Friday night \u2014 certainly take full advantage of having their dominant center.",
      "\u201cSo it just has this domino effect, but it starts with her,\u201d Close said. \u201cThe reality for us is that if she gets a touch \u2014 people work possessions all the time just to create rotation. Like how are we going to do this, create rotation, flatten out their defense, force them to be in a scramble mode. We have a really good way. We just pass it to Lauren and force that every single time.\u201d",
      "Lee was a second-team AP All-American as a junior in 2022, the same year she set an NCAA single-game record with 61 points against Oklahoma, but missed all of the following season because of a knee injury. Her 64.1% field goal percentage this season is a career high, while averaging 15.6 points and 6.4 rebounds playing fewer than 19 minutes a game.",
      "\u201cI definitely have been a more traditional post, and that\u2019s just where my strength lies,\" Lee said. \u201cOur coaches and our team have done a good job of building a strong guard presence around that. So I haven\u2019t really had to really step out much.\u201d",
      "The fifth-seeded Wildcats play top-seeded USC on Saturday night. Earlier that day, second-seeded TCU faces third-seeded Notre Dame for the second time this season.",
      "Prince is among 11 transfers for TCU since coach Mark Campbell took over two years ago after the Horned Frogs went 1-17 in Big 12 games.",
      "Campbell was previously an Oregon assistant and overlapped some of Prince's time there. Nyara Sabally was then the prominent player inside for the Ducks, but the coach wanted Prince to dominate inside for the Horned Frogs.",
      "\u201cMe and Sedona have had healthy dialog of trying to figure out how to impose her will in games,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf I let her, she would stay on the perimeter and shoot 3s all game. ... I think the greatest thing she\u2019s improved in is getting comfortable around the basket and imposing her will around the basket.\"",
      "Prince made the only 3 she has attempted since Christmas, and is 8 for 28 from long range in her career. Neither Betts nor Lee have shot any 3s.",
      "\u201cI was a passer and a shooter (at Oregon), and that\u2019s why I got really good at that like 12- to 15-foot range shot,\" Prince said. \"So coming here, Mark and I had the conversation of like, you need to get really, really good at catching the ball deep in the post and making simple post moves, but take advantage of being 6-7, getting stronger. Yeah, it's fun.\u201d",

      "After beating the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on Tuesday night, they have strung together their most consecutive victories since November 2022. It's the longest active winning streak in the NHL.",
      "\u201cWe've just got a recipe that works and a game plan that everybody believes in,\u201d said Dylan Holloway, who has 24 goals in a breakout season. \u201cGuys are playing for each other. It's a good vibe in here, for sure.\u201d",
      "St. Louis has outscored opponents 36-10 and only trailed for a total of 5:24 during this winning stretch. It's just business as usual, according to Alexandre Texier.",
      "\u201cWe've got a job to do,\u201d said Texier, who like Holloway, scored against Montreal. \u201cThis game is over and we think about the next game. We're not enjoying too much about this momentum. We want to be in the playoffs. We just have to do it every single night.\u201d",
      "The Blues are 13-2-2 since the season resumed after the 4 Nations Face-Off break, outscoring opponents 70-38. No team in the NHL has more points or goals in that time.",
      "\u201cThere's a pace and a purpose to what they're doing,\u201d coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cThey're just doing it naturally. There's smiles on their faces. They're loving doing things right.\"",
      "The formula during the streak has been simple. The Blues are strong on the forecheck and work to limit transition opportunities for their opponents. They block as many shots as possible.",
      "\u201cIt starts with the belief in this group and believing in the process and each other,\u201d said Philip Broberg, who scored a goal and had three assists against Montreal to keep his impressive season rolling. \u201cIt's all about hard work.\u201d",
      "Montgomery agreed, calling his team's effort professional.",
      "\u201cEveryone's playing well: Our top line, our top six are scoring and playing defense,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cOur bottom six are scoring and hanging on to pucks and protecting pucks. Our defense has been really solid. The little details have been there throughout the lineup. Everybody\u2019s doing it.\"",
      "Montgomery has helped turn things around since replacing fired coach Drew Bannister on Nov. 25 after a 9-12-1 start. But the Blues were still eight points behind Vancouver for the Western Conference's second and final wild-card spot coming out of the break and had not won three in a row all season.",

      "\u201cI know it\u2019s a simple answer, but it\u2019s just guys playing hard, playing for one another and playing together,\u201d captain Brayden Schenn said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t all been pretty, but we\u2019re finding a way and that\u2019s the most important thing this time of the year.

      "The Cougars were No. 1 in scoring defense, more than a half-point better than the next-best team. The Bulldogs were No. 2 in scoring offense, trailing only Alabama in putting up nearly 87 points per game.",
      "Yet one of the biggest reasons that Houston was able to advance to the Sweet 16 with an 81-76 victory over the Bulldogs was its ability to play any style of basketball. Sure, the Cougars managed to hold Gonzaga nearly 10 points below its season average, but they also ramped up their own scoring, proving that they are more than just a bunch of defensive stoppers.",
      "\u201cJust win and advance,\u201d Sampson said afterward. \u201cDo what it takes. That's all that matters.\u201d",
      "Throughout the 68-team field, those that were able to survive the first weekend were often those that were willing to change things up if the moment dictated it. The defensive dynamo was able to get into transition and pile up points, or the team that loves to score buckled down at the other end of the floor, making life difficult for its unsuspecting opponent.",
      "That has been the case with Mississippi so far in the tournament.",
      "The Rebels rolled into the postseason in the top 50 nationally in scoring, but their defense was middling at best: 175th out of the 364 teams in men's Division I basketball. Yet the same bunch who scored 98 points against Kentucky and 100 against Oral Roberts in the regular season stifled North Carolina in a 71-64 first-round win, then held Iowa State below its season scoring average in a 91-78 victory that pushed Ole Miss into the regional semifinals.",
      "\u201cTheir defensive versatility is terrific,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger marveled afterward. \u201cTheir switch ability \u2014 guards on bigs, bigs on guards. They do a great job. Their defense really tries to frustrate you by not allowing the ball to get in the paint, and trying to keep it on one side of the floor. And when they're at their best, they're doing that really well.\u201d",
      "It will take Ole Miss doing it at their best with Michigan State up next; the Spartans are among the most versatile of any team left. They are top 50 in both scoring and defense, and they showed it off last weekend, putting up 87 points against Bryant and holding New Mexico to 63 in a pair of wins.",
      "\u201cWe're just a team that can play multiple ways,\u201d the Spartans' Jaden Akins said.",
      "So is Duke, which was fourth nationally in scoring and sixth in scoring defense. And when you have that combination, the results in the opening weekend were not surprising: 93-49 over Mount St. Mary's and 89-66 over Baylor.",
      "Kentucky was sixth nationally in scoring this season, but coach Mark Pope's bunch \u2014 315th in scoring defense \u2014 played a more patient game with plenty of success in a 76-57 first-round win over Wofford. It wasn't a surprise that Arizona averaged 90 points in wins over Akron and Oregon, but it may have been that the Wildcats held the Zips to just 65 in the first round.",
      "Then there's Alabama, which looked every bit like the nation's highest-scoring team in a tougher-than-expected first-round win over Robert Morris and a second-round blitz of Saint Mary's. But the Crimson Tide also looked a lot like, say, Houston the way it defended the Gaels, holding them to just 66 points in advancing to the Sweet 16.",
      "That's where the Crimson Tide will face BYU, a team that plays much more like itself.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to say it\u2019s refreshing to go against somebody that plays like us,\u201d Tide coach Nate Oats said, \"because I think we\u2019re really tough to guard, and we\u2019ve led the country in scoring the last two years. I don\u2019t think anybody is saying it\u2019s refreshing to play Alabama, whoever is running the defense for the other team. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not such a smash-mouth game like playing football out there like some of these teams, but they\u2019re not easy to cover.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to really lock in and coaches are going to have to really do a good job getting our guys ready and then our guys are going to have to execute what the plan is, whatever we decide to put in.\u201d",

      "Blatter, now aged 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers on his desk or held his left hand over his mouth.",
      "Only when the 55-minute verdict statement was over did Blatter smile before reaching across to shake his lawyer's hand. Blatter then shared a long hug with his daughter, Corinne.",
      "\u201cYou have seen my daughter was coming with tears because she believed in (her) father and I believed in myself,\u201d said Blatter, who spoke of a sword of Damocles being removed from over his head. \u201cTo wait such a long time affects the person and my family was very much affected.\"",

      "\u201cThis persecution by FIFA and some Swiss federal prosecutors for 10 years is now finished, is now totally finished,\" Platini said leaving the court, insisting his honor was restored. \"So I\u2019m very happy.\u201d",

      "\u201cMichel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,\u201d his lawyer Dominic Nellen said in a statement. \u201dAfter two acquittals, even the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland must realize that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed.\"",
      "A further appeal to the Swiss supreme court can be filed by the prosecutors' office, which said in a statement it \u201cwill decide about how to further proceed.\u201d",
      "Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that ultimately came to nothing in court yet totally altered world soccer body FIFA.",
      "The legal case swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.",
      "Blatter approved FIFA paying 2 million Swiss francs (now $2.21 million) to France soccer great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential advisor from 1998-2002.",
      "The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly 9\u00bd years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of the two men.",
      "That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.",
      "With Platini soon suspended and banned by FIFA, European soccer body UEFA ran his long-time secretary general Gianni Infantino as its election candidate. Infantino was a surprise winner in February 2016 and is set to lead FIFA until at least 2031.",
      "Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter\u2019s reputation likely always will be tied to leading FIFA during corruption crises that took down a swath of senior soccer officials worldwide.",
      "Platini, one of soccer\u2019s greatest players and later Blatter\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in soccer politics, never did get the FIFA presidency he often called his destiny.",
      "Neither Blatter nor Platini has worked in soccer since they were suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in October 2015. They were later banned and failed to overturn the bans in separate appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2016.",
      "\u201dThe criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini, although no incriminating evidence was ever presented,\" Nellen said, suggesting further legal action \"against those responsible for the criminal proceedings.\u201d",
      "Platini\u2019s ban expired in 2019 and Blatter was given a subsequent ban by FIFA in 2021 months before his first was due to end.",
      "Blatter is exiled from soccer until late in 2028 \u2014 when he will be 92 \u2014 because of an ethics prosecution of alleged self-dealing in eight-figure management bonuses paid for successfully organizing the men\u2019s World Cup in 2010 and 2014.",
      "The verdict was given Tuesday in a low-key provincial courthouse where a four-day trial was held three weeks ago.",
      "Blatter and Platini have claimed at five different judicial bodies \u2014 twice at FIFA, then the Court of Arbitration for Sport and now two Swiss federal criminal courts \u2014 that they had a verbal \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to one day settle the unpaid and non-contracted salary.",
      "Platini was a storied former captain and coach of the France national term when he worked to help Blatter get elected to lead FIFA in Paris on the eve of the 1998 World Cup he organized.",
      "The two men said Platini agreed to be a presidential adviser on an annual salary of 300,000 Swiss francs (now $340,000) through 2002. They claim there was a verbal deal to later get the balance of 1 million Swiss francs for each year that FIFA could not pay at the time.",
      "Platini started asking for the money early in 2010, citing seven-figure payments made to senior Blatter aides who left FIFA which showed the soccer body could afford to pay him. The payment was finally made in February 2011.",
      "Details of the payment only emerged in the crisis that hit FIFA in May 2015 when U.S. federal investigators unsealed a sweeping investigation of international soccer officials. Swiss authorities made early-morning arrests at hotels in Zurich before seizing FIFA financial and business records.",
      "In 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors already were handling a criminal complaint filed by FIFA. That was about suspected financial wrongdoing linked to votes in December 2010 that picked Russia and Qatar as future World Cup hosts.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "The moon will appear to take bites out of the sun during a partial solar eclipse in the Northern Hemisphere",
      "NEW YORK -- The moon will appear to take bites out of the sun this weekend during a partial solar eclipse in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 but make sure to protect your eyes.",
      "The eclipse will be visible Saturday across Europe, western Africa, eastern North America and northern Asia. The sun will shrink the most for the northeastern United States, Greenland and eastern Canada.",
      "During a partial solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and Earth. The moon casts a shadow on Earth and only partly blocks the sun, making it appear like a crescent. Unlike a total solar eclipse, there's no totality so experts say proper eye protection must be worn the whole time.",
      "\u201cEclipses are just a game of light and shadow that are played by the sun, moon and Earth,\u201d said Auriane Egal with the Planetarium in Montr\u00e9al.",
      "Solar and lunar eclipses happen anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. Due to the moon's tilted orbit around Earth, they tend to come in pairs: a total lunar eclipse turned the moon red mid-March.",
      "To see the eclipse, look on astronomy websites to see when it begins in your area. The spectacle is slotted during sunrise for most of the Americas, late morning for western Europe and Africa and afternoon for eastern Europe and northern Asia.",
      "During the eclipse, the sun will slowly slim to a crescent as the moon appears to cover it and the day may get dimmer.",
      "\u201cIt will feel like a particularly cloudy day,\u201d said Juan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz-Mateos with the European Southern Observatory.",
      "Check weather conditions before heading outside. Clear skies away from tall buildings and city lights are best, especially in the Americas where the sun may be rising during the eclipse.",
      "Grab eclipse glasses ahead of time to spot the sight safely through a local science museum or ordering online from a seller cleared on the American Astronomical Society's website.",
      "Viewers can also enjoy the spectacle through indirect ways such as making a pinhole projector using household materials. Holding up a colander will produce a similar effect. Peering at the ground under a shady tree can yield crescent shadows as the sunlight filters through branches and leaves.",
      "Another total lunar eclipse and partial solar eclipse will return in September with the best solar eclipse views in Antarctica and New Zealand.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the quest for animal-to-human organ transplants \u2013 with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too.",
      "A Chinese patient is the third person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2013 an Alabama woman transplanted in November and a New Hampshire man transplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \"is very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital's xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",
      "The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.",
      "\u201cWe do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,\u201d Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.",
      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support by externally attaching a pig liver to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",
      "In China, Wang\u2019s team didn\u2019t remove the deceased person\u2019s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.",
      "That \u201cclouds the picture,\u201d said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn't involved with the work. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully a first step but it\u2019s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.\u201d",
      "Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.",
      "According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it\u2019s unclear how that experiment turned out.",

      "Hints of auroras were first faintly detected in ultraviolet light during a flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. Webb captured Neptune's shimmering lights in infrared light, providing direct evidence they exist.",
      "NASA released the images on Wednesday, and the results were published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",

      "Defense attorney Jose Baez urged an acquittal of his 32-year-old client, calling the proof \u201cincredibly flawed.\" He urged the jury to \u201clook at evidence, lack of evidence and the conflict of the evidence\u201d to exonerate Javice.",

Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Residents of the Tuscany beach enclave of Orbetello are seeking a state of emergency declaration to help combat an invasion of midges that are keeping people indoors and threatening businesses catering to tourists.",
      "Millions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.",
      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",
      "A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to \u201cprotect citizens and economic activities in the area,\u201d Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.",
      "Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition \u201cSave the Orbetello Lagoon\u201d had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",

      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "\u201cRestore the climate. Heal the ocean,\u201d reads the motto stamped on a shipping container nearby.",
      "Planetary is part of a growing industry racing to engineer a solution to global warming using the absorbent power of the oceans. It is backed by $1 million from Elon Musk\u2019s foundation and competing for a prize of $50 million more.",
      "Dozens of other companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more. Nearly 50 field trials have taken place in the past four years, with startups raising hundreds of millions in early funds.",
      "But the field remains rife with debate over the consequences for the oceans if the strategies are deployed at large scale, and over the exact benefits for the climate. Critics say the efforts are moving too quickly and with too few guardrails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West. Everybody is on the bandwagon, everybody wants to do something,\u201d said Adina Paytan, who teaches earth and ocean science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",
      "The winner will be announced April 23 \u2014 the day after Earth Day.",

      "In the corners of social media dominated by wellness content, influencers recommend an assortment of treatments and products to support weight loss, fight exhaustion or promote other desired health outcomes.",
      "Some of the endorsed approaches may be helpful. Many play into fads with scant evidence to back up enthusiasts' claims, medical experts say.",
      "Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such as seed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that\u2019s been touted online as \u201cnature\u2019s Ozempic,\u201d and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue.",
      "To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment's backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure of mainstream acceptance.",
      "The new U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had his Instagram account suspended in 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr. Mehmet Oz accused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.",
      "A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",

      "Luigi Mangione violated the \"special treatment\" he was afforded for his last court appearance when handwritten notes were concealed inside a pair of argyle socks he was allowed to wear, New York City prosecutors said Wednesday in a new court filing.",
      "Mangione, who is accused of gunning down United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, was given special accommodations for his \"fashion needs\" when he was allowed to change out of his jail-issued clothing before his Feb. 21 court appearance, according to the filing.",
      "The defense team gave a court officer a bag of clothes, which included a new pair of argyle socks wrapped around cardboard, the filing said.",
      "\"Secreted in the cardboard were two personal heart-shaped notes, one addressed to an unknown person named 'Joan' and the other to Luigi stating in part 'know there are thousands of people wishing you luck,'\" the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said.",
      "\"In spite of this, the defendant was permitted to wear the argyle socks, which he first changed into and later changed out of because he felt that 'they did not look good,'\" prosecutors said.",
      "Mangione ended up appearing sock-less at the court appearance, with shackles around his ankles.",
      "\"Fortunately, the items smuggled were handwritten notes and not contraband capable of harming the transporting officers,\" prosecutors noted.",

      "Prosecutors conceded they have not provided the testimony of civilian witnesses before the grand jury because they \"constituted a fraction of the testimony before the Grand Jury,\" comprising four of the 23 witnesses called. Otherwise, the DA's office said there have been ample discovery disclosures to the defense.",
      "Prosecutors also said in Wednesday's court filing that Mangione does not need his own \"specially formulated laptop\" in jail because he \"fails to show a necessity\" to receive one.",
      "Mangione's attorneys asked that he be provided with a laptop \"modified to the detention center\u2019s regulations\" so he can view videos, photos and other evidence.",
      "\"Without the laptop, which allows Mr. Mangione to review discovery outside the presence of counsel, there are not enough visiting hours that would allow the defense to view all discovery with the defendant (including thousands of hours of video) and also meet the Court's current motion schedule,\" the defense said.",
      "Few inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn are given laptops.",
      "Prosecutors said Mangione \"has ample access to desktop computers\" that he can use to review evidence, conduct legal research, send emails and draft motions.",
      "\"Ironically, the defense repeats at every opportunity that defendant is being treated differently than other defendants similarly situated. Yet, that's precisely what the defense seeks -- special treatment for defendant, without circumstances that warrant it,\" Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann said.",
      "On Dec. 4, Mangione allegedly shot and killed Thompson in a premeditated attack outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan as the CEO headed to an investors conference.",
      "According to a newly disclosed court document, the backpack Mangione was carrying when he was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the murder was full of items that could suggest he intended to remain on the run and, possibly, kill again.",
      "The backpack had a gun, a Glock magazine, 9 mm cartridges and a silencer, along with a knife, phone charger, duct tape, passport, zip ties, clothes, a computer and handwritten notes, the automatic discovery form said.",
      "Authorities also found receipts for items purchased at a CVS and for registration at a New York City hostel under the name Mark Rosario, which matches the name on a fake New Jersey driver's license Mangione allegedly carried.",
      "Prosecutors extracted data from devices linked to Mangione, including a Motorola cellphone he allegedly dropped while fleeing, the document said.",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges.",
      "He has not yet entered a plea to federal charges. One of the federal charges, murder through use of a firearm, makes Mangione eligible for the death penalty if convicted.",
      "He is due back in court on April 18.",

      "He said the invitation was \"not an unusual thing in Washington.\"",
      "\"I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it,\" he told ABC News.",

      "\"Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be \"completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News a \"long conversation\" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing \"whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen.\"",
      "The messages went back and forth with \"a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He told ABC News at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but still was not sure whether or not it was a hoax.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see \"who was trying to entrap me or trick me.\" Then on March 15, he said it became \"overwhelmingly clear\" it was a legitimate group chat, he told ABC News.",
      "At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or \"somebody identified as Pete,\" providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a \"sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen\" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he was in his car and waiting with his phone to \"see if this was a real thing.\"",
      "\"Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack,\" he said.",
      "When the attacks seemed to be \"going well,\" Goldberg told ABC News that members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.",
      "\"That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app,\" Goldberg told ABC News. \"My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.",
      "\"I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waltz appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth \u2014 what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",

    "summary": "Some Republicans are raising concerns ahead of a key special election in Florida next Tuesday in what appeared to be a safe U.S. House district for the GOP.",
    "story": [
      "The district voted for Trump in 2024, but the GOP candidate lags in fundraising.",
      "Some Republicans are raising concerns ahead of a key special election in Florida on Tuesday in what appeared to be a safe U.S. House district for the party as Republican state Sen. Randy Fine vies for the chance to take the seat vacated by  former Rep. Mike Waltz.",
      "The special election in Florida's 6th Congressional District, which is on the state's eastern coast and includes the city of Daytona Beach, is being held on Tuesday, April 1, to fill the vacancy created by Waltz when he resigned to become President Donald Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Another special election, in the state's 1st District, will also occur on April 1 to fill the vacancy left by former Rep. Matt Gaetz when he resigned from Congress late last year.",
      "While Republicans are favored to win both races, given that the districts were ruby-red in 2024, some have speculated that the margin between the Republican and Democratic candidates could be tighter than anticipated, given Trump's voter disapproval ratings and Democrats' success in some recent legislative district elections.",
      "With Fine specifically, some Republicans have raised concerns over his fundraising and campaigning.",
      "Fine's fundraising has lagged behind Democratic candidate Josh Weil, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. Fine has raised or received about $987,000 from late November 2024 through mid-March, while Weil has raised or received over $9 million from Oct. 1, 2024, through mid-March. Fine also donated $600,000 to himself last week, according to other FEC filings.",
      "(Weil's campaign has spent over $8 million of its money, per the filings. Fine's campaign also spent much of its money before his own donations last week.)",
      "Those voicing concerns about the race include some Republicans. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, told reporters on Tuesday, \"Regardless of the outcome in that, it's going to be a way underperformance from when I won that district by in '22 [as a candidate for governor] and what President Trump won in November.\"",
      "\"They're going to try to lay that at the feet of President Trump,\" DeSantis added. \"That is not a reflection of President Trump. It's a reflection of the specific candidate running in that race. And President Trump, if he were on the ballot in this special election, he would win by 30 points, no question.\"",
      "DeSantis did say that he still expects a Republican candidate will be successful in the district. Still, DeSantis and Fine have clashed before, including when Fine switched his endorsement in the 2024 presidential primaries from DeSantis to Trump.",
      "Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, said on Monday on his podcast show that \"Trump won that district by 30 points in November. ... We have a candidate that I don't think is winning. That's an issue.\"",
      "ABC News reached out to Fine's campaign for comment about the Republican concerns.",
      "Fine, on social media, has continued to express optimism, writing on X on Tuesday night, \"As I sit in my [state] Senate office for the last time, I want to thank the voters who have elected me seven times to represent them in Tallahassee. It's been a profound honor, and I can't wait to do it again.\"",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, has not invested in the race but indicated it is not worried about a loss.",
      "\"Randy Fine is going to be a member of Congress. Everything else is just noise,\" Mike Marinella, a spokesman for the NRCC, told ABC News.",
      "Fine, who was elected to the Florida state Senate in 2024, previously served as a state House representative and worked beforehand as a casino executive. In the state legislature, Fine promoted bills on school choice, immigration, combating antisemitism and other issues.",
      "He also sponsored a high-profile measure in 2022 that would eliminate some special districts in Florida, including one that encompasses Walt Disney World, amid a fight between the Florida government and The Walt Disney Company. (ABC News is owned by The Walt Disney Company, which also owns Walt Disney World.) A settlement was reached in March 2024.",
      "The Florida special elections could affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives. As of Wednesday, less than a week out to the special election, Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House, with 218 seats to Democrats' 213 seats. (Four seats, including the two Florida seats, are vacant.)",
      "Fine does have some momentum -- for instance, he does have Trump's strong endorsement.",
      "Trump wrote in late March on his social media platform Truth Social, \"A highly successful, Harvard educated businessman, and greatly respected State Legislator, Randy has been a tremendous Voice for MAGA.\" The president also encouraged Republicans to vote early. The early voting period began on March 22.",
      "Fine also has recent history pointing in favor of Republicans holding on to the district.",
      "In the U.S. House general election in this district in 2024, Waltz received 67% of the vote, while Democratic candidate James Stockton received 33% of the vote. In this district in the presidential race, meanwhile, Trump received about 65% of the vote, while Vice President Kamala Harris received about 35% of the vote.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have said special elections are not necessarily comparable to regular elections, given that voter turnout can be much lower during the special elections.",

      "The senators further requested an answer about whether any cabinet or White House officials are using Signal or other commercial products to discuss classified or sensitive information, or any communications subject to statutory recordkeeping requirements. If so, they asked the White House to provide details on how it is meeting record-keeping requirements.",

      "Authorities deported over 200 alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Trump administration is standing its ground in the ongoing dispute about whether it willfully violated a court order last week, arguing in a court filing late Tuesday that a federal judge's directive to turn around two deportation flights was not a binding order.",
      "In a 14-page filing, lawyers with the Department of Justice argued that U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's oral directive was \"not enforceable as an injunction\" when the judge ordered that the government turn around two deportation flights on their way to El Salvador after the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members without due process.",
      "The government failed to turn the flights around, and an official subsequently acknowledged that \"many\" of the detainees did not have criminal records in the United States.",
      "\"[A]ny any order that restrained the invocation of the Proclamation could not have thereby compelled the President to return foreign terrorists from outside the United States -- and any governmental refusal to do so was thus not a violation of the Court's orders,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign wrote in Tuesday's filing.",
      "At no point in the filing did the Trump administration argue it complied with the court's oral directive to return the two flights of Venezuelan migrants, which was issued from the bench at approximately 6:45 p.m. ET last Saturday; instead, the DOJ lawyers attacked the authority of the bench ruling while insisting they complied with the court's written order that was issued later that evening.",
      "\"It is well-settled that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" Ensign wrote. \"There are powerful, common-sense reasons why only written injunctions are binding.\"",
      "Because Judge Boasberg did not mention the return of the flights in his written order -- issued at approximately 7:25 p.m. ET on Saturday -- Ensign argued that the Trump administration may have believed the judge changed his mind.",
      "\"When the written order did not include that command, the Government could reasonably have understood that as reflecting the Court's more considered view in a quickly evolving situation,\" the filing said.",
      "According to DOJ lawyers, the flights carrying the alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua were outside of U.S. airspace when the judge issued his written order, meaning Judge Boasberg lacked the authority to turn the flights around.",
      "\"Here, any members of the putative class aboard the referenced flights had already left the United States when the minute order was entered, and thus had already been removed. No court has the power to compel the President to return them, and there is no sound basis to read the Court's minute order as requiring that unprecedented step,\" Ensign wrote.",
      "DOJ lawyers also slammed Judge Boasberg's authority to redirect the flights, arguing the directive is an \"astonishingly ultra vires exercise of judicial power\" that conflicts with \"basic constitutional principles.\"",
      "\"The President's ultimate direction of the flights at issue here -- especially once they had departed from U.S. airspace -- implicated military matters, national security, and foreign affairs outside of our Nation's borders. As such, it was beyond the courts' authority to adjudicate,\" the filing said.",
      "On Monday, a federal appeals court heard arguments from the Trump administration seeking to overturn Boasberg's block on the use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. The appeals court did not issue an immediate ruling.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries.

      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",
      "Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",

      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",

      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",

      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center.

      "Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail for legal purposes as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes \u2014 not for communicating with anyone \u2014 as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",
      "In a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.",
      "Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \u201cno connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.",
      "Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.",
      "But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans\u2019 frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.",
      "Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.",
      "Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.",
      "If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.",
      "Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington D",
      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.",
      "For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong \u2014 a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.",
      "That's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.",
      "While the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring the comfort, consistency, and safety of Waymo One to Washingtonians, those who work and play in the city every day, and the millions of people from around the world who travel to the District every year,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana.",
      "If Waymo's ambitions pan out, Washington and Miami next year will be added to four other U.S. markets where its robotaxis are transporting passengers \u2014 Phoenix, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.",
      "The growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.",
      "That has established Waymo as the early frontrunner in driverless technology while others are racing to catch up. Both Amazon and Tesla are gearing up to launch their own services in different U.S. cities while another ride-hailing service, Lyft, has announced plans to add robotaxis as an option in Atlanta and Dallas.",
      "Waymo's early lead in the still-nascent robotaxi market is a vindication of a technology that began as a secret project within Google in 2009 before it was spun off into a separate company owned by Alphabet Inc. in 2016.",

      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country\u2019s north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar\u2019s home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.",
      "Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating \u201cparticularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.\u201d",
      "He said Kiir and Machar don\u2019t trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.",
      "\u201cRampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\u201d Haysom said.",
      "\u201cGiven this grim situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.\u201d",
      "Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.",
      "He said the U.N. takes the threat of the \u201cethnic transformation\u201d of the conflict very seriously.",
      "To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.",
      "Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions \u201cthrough dialogue rather than military confrontation.\u201d",

      "Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago, the latest sign of the intense interest in a contest that has obliterated spending records and drawn attention from President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser, Elon Musk.",
      "As of Tuesday, with just a week to go until the final day of voting, nearly 48% more early ballots have been cast compared with the same point two years ago, according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. More than 345,000 voters had returned ballots, either by mail or in person, compared with about 233,000 at this point two years ago during another race for a Supreme Court seat.",
      "The election will determine whether the court will remain under 4-3 liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. One of the current liberal justices is retiring.",
      "This year's race has morphed into a proxy battle over the nation\u2019s politics, with Trump and Musk getting behind Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate in a race that is officially nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cAll Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post late last week.",
      "Total spending on the race has reached more than $73 million, including more than $14 million by groups funded by Musk, according to a tally Monday by the Brennan Center for Justice. That's the most on record for any U.S. judicial race, breaking the $56 million spent on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court contest in 2023, when majority control also was on the line.",
      "All that spending and attention has helped fuel early voting, said Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin's former top elections official who now works as a consultant. He spoke while taking a break from working at a Madison poll site where people could vote early.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of money being invested,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEverything seems to be focused on, \u2018Let\u2019s get out the vote.\u2019\u201d",
      "After previously being critical of early voting, Trump and the Republican Party are urging their supporters to cast their ballots before the final day of voting on April 1. Early voting ends Sunday. The strategy, which they deployed with great success in last year's presidential race, appears to be contributing to large turnout increases in more conservative counties across Wisconsin.",
      "Schimel's opponent, Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, has raised more than $25 million for the race to date, including $5.5 million from the state Democratic Party since early February. Her supporters include billionaire Democratic megadonor George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, had raised more than $12 million, which includes more than $6 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party since early February.",
      "But outside groups have more than made up the difference in what the candidates have raised.",
      "The roughly $28 million spent by the candidates as of Monday was far exceeded by the roughly $45 million spent so far by outside groups, according to the Brennan Center calculation. Schimel and his allies, which include groups backed by Musk, have spent about $41 million, while Crawford and her supporters have spent about $32 million.",
      "Voters in Wisconsin do not register by political party, so it's impossible to know how many of the ballots already submitted came from Republicans or Democrats. But the data shows that the largest increases are coming from both Democratic- and Republican-heavy counties.",
      "Milwaukee County, the state's largest county and the one that is home to the most Democrats, led all counties in ballots returned with 54,750. That is more than 46% ahead of this point two years ago. Liberal Dane County, the state's second largest county and home to the state capital of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, has also seen a 46% increase.",
      "But Republican parts of the state also have seen big jumps.",
      "Voting was up in the three suburban Milwaukee counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, which are commonly referred to as the WOW counties. Ballot returns were up more than 62% in Waukesha and 51% in Ozaukee. In Washington, the most heavily Republican of the three counties, early voting was more than double two years ago.",
      "In Brown County, the state's fourth most populous one, which is reliably Republican, early turnout was up more than 34%.",
      "While the early voting is high for a spring election, it's far from what battleground Wisconsin saw at this point before the presidential race. A week before the Nov. 5 election, nearly 1 million voters had cast their ballots, almost four times as many as in this race to date.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules.",
      "On Monday night, Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told supporters that electing Crawford was important so she and other liberal justices can order a redraw of congressional boundary lines. Even though Wisconsin is a swing state, Republican-drawn lines have allowed the party to hold six of its eight congressional seats.",
      "\u201cAs soon as possible, we need to be able to revisit that and have fair lines,\u201d Jeffries said in a live discussion on the social media platform X. \u201cThe only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Schimel has accused Crawford of promising to Democrats that she will redraw the lines. Crawford has denied that.",

      "Democrat Dan Goughnour has won a special election in western Pennsylvania",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Democrat Dan Goughnour handily won a special election in western Pennsylvania on Tuesday, keeping majority control of the state House in his party\u2019s hands by a single seat.",
      "Goughnour beat Republican Chuck Davis in a district in the Mon Valley region southeast of Pittsburgh, winning a seat that became vacant in January with the death of Democratic state Rep. Matthew Gergely.",
      "In a second legislative special election Tuesday, in a suburban and farming part of Lancaster County, Democrat James Andrew Malone, the mayor of 4,500-population East Petersburg, was clinging to a narrow lead over Republican Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons. A Democratic flip of that district, if it occurs, would be a major upset but would not alter Republican control of the state Senate.",
      "As of late Tuesday, the race was too early to call. With 99% of the estimated vote counted, Malone led Parsons by 482 votes, or 0.89% of nearly 54,000 ballots cast, with an unknown number of provisional ballots left to be counted.",
      "Parsons posted on social media late Tuesday that he was \u201cdisappointed in the numbers\u201d and that \u201cit appears we will come up a little short.\u201d",
      "Malone told WGAL-TV the national political environment was a factor.",
      "\u201cEveryday voters are not liking what they're seeing in the federal level. They don't like the chaos,\u201d Malone said.",
      "No matter the result, the Senate will remain comfortably in Republican control, and the chief executive is Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star among Democrats who is seen as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. The partisan divide and power sharing in Harrisburg \u2014 a dynamic that has prevailed for much of the past two decades \u2014 has prevented major changes in state law.",
      "After the House race was called, Goughnour said, \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, but I feel good.\u201d He said his goal was to \u201cmaintain common sense in Harrisburg\u201d and give his district a strong voice.",
      "\u201cWe knocked on thousands and thousands of doors,\u201d Goughnour said. \u201cWe worked hard and didn\u2019t take anything for granted.\u201d",
      "Goughnour\u2019s victory means Democrats control the House by a single representative, 102 to 101. The party will be able to keep Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia as the chamber\u2019s presiding officer.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement that the majority means state House Democrats \u201ccan stand up to Trump\u2019s mayhem in Washington,\u201d prevent efforts to weaken Shapiro's authority and \u201ccontinue to expand job opportunities, strengthen schools and create safe communities in Pennsylvania.\u201d",
      "The Senate vacancy in northern Lancaster County was created when Sen. Ryan Aument, a Republican, quit to take a job working for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick. Malone and the Democrats built on a strong advantage in mail-in ballots to combat the Republicans' significant voter registration edge.",
      "On his way to narrowly winning Pennsylvania in November, President Donald Trump received 57% of the district vote, while McCormick, a Republican, received 56% in the district as he beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey. Aument ran unopposed in his last election in 2022.",
      "Shapiro posted on social media that the results in Lancaster showed voters \u201cchose a better way forward \u2014 an embrace of competence, commonsense and a desire to bring people together.\u201d",
      "Parsons is an establishment Republican, military veteran and former prosecutor who boasted about having visited the White House four times and working with Trump staff on policy issues.",
      "Malone said a high priority was lowering the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "\u201cHonestly, we ran a good campaign,\u201d Malone said while votes were being tallied. \u201cWe spoke to everybody about what we wanted to do, and frankly, a lot of people preferred us over the alternative.\u201d",
      "Goughnour, the winner of the House race, will be resigning as a detective supervisor after spending well over a decade as a police officer in McKeesport. He is a Teamster and a first-term member of the school board in McKeesport, where he graduated high school. Goughnour is married and has three children.",
      "Davis, a veteran volunteer firefighter and fire chief, is president of the White Oak Borough Council.",
      "The district is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) southeast of Pittsburgh, at the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers. Many of the towns that make up the district were part of the once-thriving steelmaking region, but the area is now economically challenged.",
      "Democrats have held the Pennsylvania House majority since 2023, after they flipped 12 seats, the minimum needed to reclaim control after more than a decade. Since then, Democrats have maintained their majority by winning a series of special elections.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is at the Supreme Court with a new emergency appeal Wednesday, this time seeking approval to go ahead with cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training.",
      "A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the cuts, finding they were already affecting training programs aimed at addressing a nationwide teacher shortage. The federal appeals court in Boston turned away a plea from the administration to allow them to resume.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun issued a temporary restraining order sought by eight Democratic-led states that argued the cuts were likely driven by efforts from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The Republican president signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Education Department, and his administration has started overhauling much of its work, including cutting dozens of contracts it dismissed as \u201cwoke\u201d and wasteful.",
      "The Justice Department has filed three other emergency appeals of court rulings that blocked administration actions.",
      "The Supreme Court has yet to rule on an appeal asking to narrow court orders that have imposed a nationwide hold on Trump\u2019s desire to restrict birthright citizenship. An appeal to halt an order requiring the rehiring of thousands of federal workers is also pending.",
      "The justices previously rejected a bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid and did not immediately allow Trump\u2019s firing to proceed of the head of a federal watchdog agency. A later ruling from a lower court, though, did force Office of Special Counsel head Hampton Dellinger from his job.",
      "The two education programs at issue \u2014 the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development \u2014 provide more than $600 million in grants for teacher preparation programs, often in subject areas such as math, science and special education, the states have argued. They said data has shown the programs had led to increased teacher retention rates and ensured that educators remain in the profession beyond five years.",
      "The administration halted the programs without notice in February.",
      "Joun, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, found that the cancellations probably violated a federal law that requires a clear explanation for such cost-cutting moves.",
      "The appellate panel that rejected the administration\u2019s request for a stay also was made up of judges nominated by Democratic presidents.",
      "California is leading the lawsuit and is joined by Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin.",
      "The order the administration wants from the high court would allow the cuts to go forward while the legal fight over them plays out.",

      "El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya said during a news conference that his decision in the prosecution of Patrick Crusius, who drove across the state for one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history and posted a racist screed just before opening fire, was driven by a majority of victims' relatives who wanted the case behind them.",
      "\u201cThis is about allowing the families of the 23 victims who lost their lives on that horrific day \u2014 and the 22 wounded \u2014 to finally have resolution in our court system,\u201d Montoya said in a statement.",
      "\u201cNow, no one in this community will ever have to hear the perpetrator\u2019s name ever again,\u201d he added. \u201cNo more hearings. No more appeals. He will die in prison.\u201d",
      "But Montoya also acknowledged at the news conference that not all families agreed with the reversal by his office, which under previous leadership had committed to taking the case to trial and seeking the death penalty.",
      "Adria Gonzalez, a survivor who helped panicked shoppers toward exits, said she feels that not pursuing the death penalty is \u201ca slap in the face for all the victims.\u201d",
      "Under the offer, Montoya said, Crusius would plead guilty to capital murder and receive life in prison with no possibility of parole. The plea hearing and sentencing is set for April 21, Montoya said, and families will be able to give victim impact statements.",
      "Mark Stevens, an attorney for Crusius, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Crusius, 26, was already sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences at the federal level after pleading guilty in 2023 to hate crime charges. Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors also took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Montoya said he supports the death penalty and believes Crusius deserves it. But he said he met with the families of the victims and while some were willing to wait as long as it took for a death sentence, there was an overriding desire to conclude the process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over,\u201d said Elise Hoffmann-Taus, whose father, Alexander Hoffmann was among those killed. \u201cThis is the outcome I wanted.\u201d",
      "Montoya, a Democrat who took office in January after defeating a Republican incumbent appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, is the fourth district attorney to oversee the case.",
      "His predecessor, Bill Hicks, said following the announcement that while he had been ready to take the case to trial and pursue the death penalty, he could not fault Montoya\u2019s reasoning behind the plea offer.",
      "\u201cIt is not the reasoning I would have followed,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI know that it was very hard for him, and I respect that it was a very difficult decision.\u201d",
      "Crusius, who is white, was 21 years old and had dropped out of community college when police say he drove more than 700 miles (1,100 kilometers) from his home near Dallas to El Paso.",
      "Moments after posting online his racist rant, which warned of a Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d of the state, he opened fire with an AK-style rifle inside and outside the store.",
      "Crusius was arrested shortly after the shooting and confessed to officers who stopped him at an intersection, police have said.",
      "Prior to the attack, Crusius appears to have been consumed by the immigration debate, posting online in support of building the border wall and other messages praising the hard-line border policies of President Donald Trump, who was in his first term at the time. He went further in the screed right before the shootings, saying Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.",
      "In the federal case, prosecutors did not formally explain their decision not to seek the death penalty, but they did acknowledge that Crusius suffered from schizoaffective disorder, which can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, said Tuesday after the announcement that he thought Crusius deserved to die: \u201cAny shooting like that is what capital punishment is for.\u201d",
      "The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to several grandparents. They included immigrants, a retired city bus driver, teachers, tradesmen including a former iron worker, and several Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.",
      "In 2023, Crusius agreed to pay more than $5 million to his victims. Court records showed that his attorneys and the Justice Department reached an agreement over the restitution amount, which was then approved by a U.S. district judge. There was no indication that he had significant assets.",

      "Vermont\u2019s child welfare agency has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state routinely targets and tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable for motherhood",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Vermont\u2019s child welfare agency has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state routinely targets and tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable for motherhood.",
      "The Department for Children and Families filed the request Monday, two months after it was sued by a woman who claims the state secretly investigated her when she was pregnant and won custody of her daughter before the baby was born. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont and the Pregnancy Justice advocacy group, seeks both an end to what it calls an illegal surveillance program and unspecified monetary damages for the woman, who is identified only by her initials, A.V.",
      "According to the complaint, the director of a homeless shelter where A.V. briefly stayed in January 2022 told the child welfare agency that she appeared to have untreated paranoia, dissociative behaviors and post-traumatic stress disorder. The state opened an investigation and later spoke to the woman\u2019s counselor, midwife and hospital social worker. The suit alleges the state received updates from the hospital and won temporary custody of the fetus while she was in labor and then immediately took the baby away when she was born.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the state had no jurisdiction before the baby was born, an argument the state rebuts in its filing.",
      "\u201cDCF is tasked with the difficult and delicate task of balancing the need to protect children from potential abuse and neglect against disruptions to families,\u201d wrote Assistant Attorney General David Groff. \u201cGiven its mission, DCF has the authority to investigate potential abuse to a soon-to-be-born child before the child is born. DCF need not wait for harm to occur after birth.\u201d",
      "The state argues that its family court system has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether a child needs care or supervision, and that the plaintiff can't relitigate custody decisions via a lawsuit. The motion neither confirms nor denies the existence of a \u201cpregnancy calendar\u201d used to track women, but says A.V. lacks standing to challenge it because she was never part of such a calendar and doesn't claim to have been.",
      "The lawsuit also names the hospital where the woman gave birth and a counseling center where she sought treatment as defendants. Lund, the counseling center, has also filed a motion to dismiss the case. In its response to the suit, Copley Hospital said it cooperated with the state's investigation as required under state law. The hospital denied that it illegally disclosed confidential medical information about A.V. or that it routinely collects and disseminates sensitive information about pregnant patients.",

      "Dozens of bird eggs and chicks have been rescued from a single wind-damaged eucalyptus tree that was dangerously close to collapse in a California park",
      "Dozens of bird eggs and chicks were rescued from nests in a single wind-damaged eucalyptus tree that was dangerously close to collapsing in a California park.",
      "Now staff at the International Bird Rescue\u2019s Los Angeles Wildlife Center have been working around the clock to care for the 47 eggs and 12 chicks, all double-crested Cormorants, in hopes that they will be able to be released back into the wild in a few months.",
      "The tree at a park in Marina del Rey was flagged earlier this month after one of its trunks fell and crushed a trash bin enclosure, explained Nicole Mooradian, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches & Harbors. Its other trunk was showing signs of collapsing as well, threatening not only the birds but anyone on the nearby public walkway or in the parking lot next door.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question of if this tree is going to fail, it was more of a when,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cThe cracks were growing wider by the day. It was really bad.\u201d",
      "For at least five hours on March 10, tree contractors meticulously removed each of the 20 nests and chopped off branches one at a time. Biologists on the ground put the eggs and hatchlings in egg cartons and boxes with heated blankets acting as temporary incubators.",
      "Double-crested Cormorants are common in Southern California and tend to nest in large colonies that may crowd a single tree, explained Kylie Clatterbuck, wildlife center manager for the bird rescue. For about a month, Cormorant parents incubate the eggs and then give the chicks regurgitated food for several weeks.",
      "Taking care of them can be very difficult because when they hatch they are essentially \u201cnaked little balls of skin\u201d completely reliant on their parents, she said.",
      "At the rescue in San Pedro, the chicks must be fed every hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.. When staff interact with them, they wear a black suit and disguise their face, while using decoys and puppets to keep the birds from forming an attachment with them, which could make them too trusting of humans in the wild.",
      "Rescue staff expect the birds to stay for at least three months and then once they can hunt on their own and fly, they plan to release them into the wild.",
      "All of the chicks are healthy and happy, with some about 2 weeks old and already eating whole fish, said Clatterbuck.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard raising baby birds. We do our best; we do what we know; we treat what we know,\" she said. \u201cAnd we can only hope that they do a good job and they can survive.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina has accelerated significantly",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina accelerated significantly Tuesday as the Republican governor and leaders of the House and Senate came together to promise to pass an ambitious bill to charge one flat rate for all taxpayers.",
      "The details of the bill weren't released at a news conference, but every speaker made sure its goal was known \u2014 take the 6.2% top income tax rate down to 3.99% for everyone by the end of 2026.",
      "If the economy keeps growing and the tax base is increasing, the plan would cut $200 million from income taxes collected until that flat rate is 2.49%.",
      "Republican leadership also promised not to increase other taxes, such as those on sales and property, to offset income tax reductions, like other nearby states have done.",
      "South Carolina would be one of a number of states looking to find a way to cut taxes. Mississippi and Louisiana are considering a swap of sales taxes or gas taxes to offset revenue lost. There are proposals to cut taxes on tips or Social Security benefits in several states and Kentucky has already lowered its income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%.",
      "Mostly unsaid at the Statehouse news conference Tuesday was the exact mechanism to get from 6% to 3.99%, outside of a promise that everyone with taxable income would pay something.",
      "Now, some residents make more than $1 million but pay no South Carolina income tax, said Republican House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.",
      "\u201cThere will be some people when we take away the gaming of the tax system \u2014 they will pay more. But we think 3.99% is a legitimately good fair tax to charge them,\u201d Bannister said.",
      "Figures from about five years ago when the income tax was first cut suggested about one-third of all people who filed a South Carolina income tax return paid nothing. Most of them were low-income residents.",
      "Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said it's only fair that even the lowest income earners pay something outside of sales tax and perhaps property tax.",
      "\u201cI look forward to a tax system in our state that is viewed as low, broad, fair, flat \u2014 doesn\u2019t take too much from anybody but everybody has to pay something, a little something, to be part of this great state of South Carolina,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "South Carolina can afford the income tax cut for now thanks to its booming economy and population, which has grown by 1.5 million people since 2000 to a total of 5.5 million residents. Many of them have been well-off retirees.",
      "The goal is to have one of the lowest income tax rates in the Southeast, lawmakers said. Bannister pointed out the 2.49% rate would be less than Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Alabama.",
      "South Carolina has less than two months left in the 2025 session to get the tax cut plan through the House and Senate and to the governor's desk. Legislative leaders said that can be done.",
      "No Democrats were seen among the several dozen lawmakers who flanked the governor and House and Senate leaders, although they have supported tax cuts before. They support the state's program to cut the top rate of 7% down to 6%, which should reach its goal next year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Weaning Caribbean countries from their dependence on Venezuelan oil and combating illegal immigration will top Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s tour of three Caribbean nations this week, a visit that comes as the Trump administration increasingly focuses its attention on the Western Hemisphere.",
      "The State Department said Rubio will push for the region to diversify its energy supplies when he visits Jamaica, Guyana and Suriname starting Wednesday, just days after President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and threatened tariffs on all goods imported into the United States by other countries that buy oil from Venezuela.",
      "Another main issue for Rubio will be the situation in Haiti, where a multinational peacekeeping force has been in place for months struggling to prevent gangs from taking over the country. Rubio spoke Tuesday with the president of Kenya, which is leading that force, although the State Department account of the call made no reference to Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, obviously, is Haiti,\u201d said Mauricio Claver-Caron, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Western Hemisphere. \u201cAnd, obviously, we all know and we share the deep commitment to tackling this challenge in Haiti.\u201d",
      "But in a conference call with reporters Tuesday, he did not offer details on what the Republican former Florida senator would suggest on Haiti policy. Rubio has extended waivers on an overall U.S. foreign aid freeze to continue to fund the security force in Haiti, but it remains unclear how long they will last.",
      "\u201cThis trip is going to add in the urgency of the moment and in the urgency of the situation to the development and implementation of a very targeted strategy in regards to Haiti to try to ensure that these gangs do not take over, obviously, Port-au-Prince but then expand beyond that,\u201d Claver-Caron said without elaborating.",
      "Energy, he said, will be the top topic of conversation while Rubio is in the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cWe are in a historic moment in the Caribbean for energy security, which has been the Achilles' heel of the Caribbean for so long and its economic development with disproportionately high electricity and energy prices,\u201d Claver-Caron said.",
      "He said Rubio\u2019s visit comes at a time of a \u201chistoric opportunity for energy security in the Caribbean, which will improve people\u2019s lives, will improve also the opportunities and the relationship with the United States and what that means, and obviously, will strengthen our neighbors, which we seek.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump announced he was tightening U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and would slap a 25% tariff on all goods sent to the U.S. by countries that import Venezuelan oil on April 2. But just hours later, the Treasury Department said it would extend a sanctions waiver for the U.S. company Chevron to continue to send Venezuelan oil to the United States until the end of May.",
      "\u201cThe fact that now their own countries \u2014 Guyana, Suriname \u2014 are able to have and really surpass Venezuela in its oil production and be able to work with its neighbors there in the region is a huge opportunity for the Caribbean,\" Claver-Caron said.",
      "He also suggested the U.S. was prepared to field questions from regional leaders about U.S. sanctions on Cuba that target programs that send doctors and nurses to the region and elsewhere. American officials have said the programs resemble organized human trafficking because the medical professionals are not paid directly.",
      "Latin American leaders have denounced the U.S. sanctions, saying they deprive their people of much needed medical assistance, but Claver-Caron dismissed those complaints and said if the leaders Rubio meets with focus on that, it will be a waste of time.",
      "\u201cIf they choose to overshadow this trip with the issue of Cuban doctors, it\u2019ll be a lost opportunity, because again, the huge opportunity here is energy security, economic development that has plagued this region, and the biggest challenge that we have is Haiti,\u201d he said.",

      "A former Minnesota state senator charged with trying to solicit a minor for prostitution and accused of attempting to obstruct the FBI\u2019s investigation from jail can be released to a halfway house pending his trial",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A former Minnesota state senator charged with trying to solicit a minor for prostitution and accused of attempting to obstruct the FBI's investigation from jail can be released to a halfway house pending trial, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Shannon Elkins ruled that Justin Eichorn, a Republican, does not pose a risk to the community and that there were reasonable explanations for actions that federal prosecutors argued warranted keeping him in jail. But she ruled there was sufficient evidence to take the case to trial. He did not enter a plea Wednesday.",
      "The 40-year-old from Grand Rapids was arrested in Bloomington on March 17 after exchanging text messages with an undercover officer who posed as a 17-year-old girl and arranging a meet-up for sex for money, the charging documents say. He was charged with attempted enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution, a felony that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, and resigned from the Senate March 20.",
      "On Sunday, federal prosecutors moved to prevent his scheduled release to the halfway house on Tuesday. They leveled detailed allegations that he tried to arrange by phone from jail for a \u201cclose, known associate\u201d \u2014 identified by prosecutors as Individual A \u2014 to retrieve a computer and other items from the St. Paul apartment where he lived alone during legislative sessions. They argued that she could have concealed and destroyed evidence in the apartment.",
      "Defense attorney Charles Hawkins revealed in court Wednesday that Individual A is Eichorn's wife. He suggested through his questioning of an FBI agent leading the investigation that she needed the computer because it contains records related to their apartment rental business, not to destroy evidence.",
      "The Eichorns have four children. His wife filed for divorce Monday.",
      "When she arrived at his apartment last Friday morning, FBI agents were already there. They declined her request to retrieve a computer that she said was used for her business. A few moments after she left, an agent called her and asked her to return for an interview. She refused.",
      "During their search of the apartment, agents found a bag on the counter containing $1,000 in cash; a 9 mm handgun and ammunition; a laptop; a computer memory card; an iPhone; and several of Eichorn\u2019s Senate business cards. They said the iPhone appeared to have been reset to its factory settings, which can erase all content on the device.",
      "FBI Special Agent Matthew Vogel conceded Wednesday that the phone appeared to have been reset Feb. 28 \u2014 well before Eichorn began communicating with the undercover officers \u2014 but said they were still studying it.",
      "Vogel also acknowledged that the defense had provided a password for the computer. He said agents had been able to access some information but that they were still working to unlock some encrypted data.",
      "Federal prosecutors Daniel Bobier argued that Eichorn lied when he told a pretrial services officer he had no firearms in his apartment.",
      "But Hawkins argued that Eichorn misunderstood the officer because of the noise in the holding area. He argued that Eichorn had the gun because he was getting threats for cosponsoring a bill that would have designated \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d as a mental illness.",
      "Hawkins declined further comment after the hearing, except to say he was planning to personally drive Eichorn to the halfway house in Duluth.",
      "Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday called a special election for Tuesday, April 29, to fill the empty seat, in time to seat a new senator for the final weeks of the legislative session. Primaries will be Tuesday, April 15. The district, which stretches from Brainerd to Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, is heavily Republican. Regardless of the outcome, Senate Democrats will continue to hold a narrow majority.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Prairie Land Potawatomi Nation has reclaimed land in Illinois that was promised to the tribe's leader 175 years ago but stolen by the federal government 20 years later.",
      "A law signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last week transferred Shabbona Lake State Recreation Area, 1,500 acres (607 hectares) in north-central Illinois.",
      "\u201cWe are proud to once again call this land home,\u201d said Joseph \u201cZeke\u201d Rupnick, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation based in Mayetta, Kansas.",
      "The action returns to the Potawatomi territory in the same area that was ceded to Chief Shab-eh-nay in a treaty with the U.S. government in 1829. Nothing ever altered that treaty, but when Shab-eh-nay and his people left for several years to visit family in Kansas, the government sold the land to white settlers.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely the same soil that the U.S. took from Chief Shab-eh-nay. The boundaries of his original 1,280-acre (518-hectare) reservation now encompass hundreds of acres of privately owned land, a golf course and county forest preserve. Returning the original land would undoubtedly put the transfer into an interminable legal wrangle.",
      "\u201cThis moment reflects the power of collaboration and the shared desire to build a future rooted in justice and respect,\" Rupnick said. \u201cIllinois has shown true courage and vision by leading the way in the Land Back movement, demonstrating that healing and reconciliation are possible.\u201d",
      "The land will stay open to the public as a park, with the state providing maintenance.",
      "Rupnick for years has traveled repeatedly from Kansas to Illinois to negotiate with local and state governments, provide equipment to help clean up after storms and speak with neighbors, many of whom fear changes will come to the park that will disrupt their lives. Rupnick told lawmakers last spring it made no sense to install a casino because of the number of state-sanctioned gambling houses in operation.",
      "He did not rule out constructing a hotel, however, noting that the park, 68 miles (109 kilometers) west of Chicago, has 150 campsites, draws 500,000 visitors a year, and the closest lodging is a 20-minute drive away.",

      "Chili\u2019s is opening a new restaurant just north of Scranton to honor the legacy of \"The Office.\"",
      "It has been nearly two decades since the workplace mockumentary \"The Office\u201d first set an episode inside a Chili's, where Michael Scott handed out Dundie awards to his ever-tolerant employees, including trophies for the whitest sneakers and for stinking up the bathroom.",
      "Over nine seasons, \u201cThe Office\u201d regularly name-dropped real places and products associated with Scranton, where the Emmy-winning show was set. There\u2019s the big pirate ship restaurant known as Cooper\u2019s Seafood House and Poor Richard\u2019s Pub inside a bowling alley. But in 2005, there was no Chili's in the Pennsylvania city.",
      "So, at last, the chain is filling a hole in Office lore by opening a Chili's in Dickson City, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of Scranton.",
      "The restaurant will be decorated as it would have been in the mid-2000s with old signs and chalkboard art. It will also feature direct nods to the show's fictitious paper company, Dunder Mifflin. In one episode, Scott, played by Steve Carell, orders an awesome blossom \u2014 a deep-fried onion with a cheese dipping sauce \u2014 while trying to win a new client over lunch at Chili's. That item, long struck from the Chili's menu nationwide, is being reintroduced in the Scranton-area restaurant only.",
      "The new Chili\u2019s will open April 7, when a \u201cScranton marg\u201d will be available nationwide for the day.",
      "Two Office actors are appearing in commercials for the restaurant: Brian Baumgartner, who played the dimwitted accountant Kevin Malone; and Kate Flannery, whose character Meredith Palmer was a party-loving divorced mother working in supplier relations. Other actors, including Melora Hardin, Andy Buckley and Amy Pietz, also feature in a promotional video.",
      "\"It seems like a wrong was righted here at around the 20th anniversary of the show to finally have a Scranton branch of Chili\u2019s,\u201d Baumgartner told The Associated Press.",
      "Decades ago, when word got out that an American version of the British show \"The Office\" would center on Scranton, some locals feared their hometown would be the butt of the joke. The Rust Belt town had its heyday generations earlier with anthracite coal mining and steam trains.",
      "The show wound up celebrating Scranton and the characters, not poking fun at them, Baumgartner said.",
      "Flannery, who is from Philadelphia, said she's happy \"The Office\" helped to reinforce local pride in the city. Scranton has hosted large Office parties, including one that drew many cast members and some 10,000 people around the 2013 series finale. Streaming services have boosted the show's popularity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like what Pam Beesly says in the last episode: there\u2019s beauty in ordinary things. And Scranton can feel ordinary to some people,\u201d Flannery told the AP. \"But it\u2019s really special. It really is.\u201d",
      "The show banked on residents and businesses to donate Scranton swag, and gave shout-outs to local landmarks. John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, filmed scenes for the opening montage in Scranton, making the city's Penn Paper tower recognizable around the world. The \u201cScranton welcomes you\u201d sign from Krasinski's footage was moved to a downtown mall because people kept stopping on a highway to take photos.",
      "For Chili's, building a themed eatery that is expected to draw tourists isn't the normal course of business, said George Felix, Chili's chief marketing officer. In 2005, the nearest Chili's was about 19 miles (30 kilometers) away from Scranton. It has since closed.",
      "\"Given the ties that this brand has to Scranton, this one was definitely special for us,\" Felix told the AP.",
      "Baumgartner, who analyzed the show in a podcast and book, said the new Chili's calls back to a crucial episode \u2014 The Dundies \u2014 that kicked off Season 2, Baumgartner said.",
      "\u201cWe were a failing show, quite frankly, with really bad ratings that first season and barely got brought back for a second,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cBut some tonal things were changed. We decided to open that second season with kind of a bang, and left the office for the first time.\u201d",
      "In that episode, Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, won the \u201cwhitest sneakers\u201d Dundie and declared tipsily, \u201cI feel God in this Chili\u2019s tonight.\u201d Pam was subsequently banned from Chili's nationwide for stealing people's drinks. In 2017, Chili's pardoned the character, saying she was welcome back.",
      "\u201cIt's going to feel like they\u2019re actually on the show because it\u2019s going to look exactly the same,\" Flannery said of the Scranton-area Chili's. \"So it\u2019s like a fan destination. It\u2019s kind of awesome.\u201d",

      "Democrat James Andrew Malone narrowly won a special election for a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a stretch of Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities",
      "MANHEIM, Pa. -- Democrat James Andrew Malone narrowly won a special election for a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a stretch of Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities, scoring an upset in a territory that a Democrat hasn\u2019t represented in the chamber for 136 years.",
      "Malone\u2019s victory over Republican Josh Parsons in Tuesday night's special election might provide a light in the darkness for Democrats struggling to unify around a strategy to counter President Donald Trump and at each others\u2019 throats publicly.",
      "A top state Senate Democrat, Sen. Vince Hughes of Philadelphia, said Malone\u2019s victory shows the value of Democrats talking to people about protecting Social Security and health care access amid the chaos and pain that Trump\u2019s administration is sowing.",
      "\u201cAs much anger that people have, they have anxiety too,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAnd last night\u2019s election sends a message that people are going to respond.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press called the race Wednesday after receiving information from county officials that there were fewer ballots left to be counted than the margin in the race.",
      "Pennsylvania's Republican Party chairman, Greg Rothman, said he didn't think the first two months of Trump's administration hurt the GOP in the race. Prices of gas and eggs are dropping and the federal government hasn't cut Social Security or Medicare, he said.",
      "Rather, Democrats did a better job at getting their voters to vote early by mail and Republicans ran a more traditional campaign employing door-knocking, mailers and phone banking that apparently didn't work, Rothman said.",
      "\u201cWe need to take this as a wake-up call to the Republican Party that we can\u2019t be complacent and we can\u2019t just run campaigns like we\u2019ve always run campaigns,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cWe need to embrace early voting.\u201d",
      "Sharif Street, Pennsylvania's Democratic Party chairman, said Trump's performance in office certainly helped Malone and the GOP's excuses that they got beaten in voting by mail is just \u201canother way of saying that \u2018people voting by mail voted against them.'\u201d",
      "A Democratic flip of that district is a major upset. Democrats say that Trump won the district by 15 percentage points in November's presidential election over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump went on to win the battleground state of Pennsylvania by almost 2 points.",
      "A Democrat last represented Lancaster County in the Senate in 1889, Democrats say. A Malone victory narrows GOP control of the state Senate to a 27-23 seat advantage.",
      "Malone is the mayor of tiny East Petersburg, population 4,500. Parsons is a Lancaster County commissioner, military veteran and former prosecutor who boasted about having visited the White House four times and working with Trump staff on policy issues.",
      "Parsons posted on social media late Tuesday that he was \u201cdisappointed in the numbers\u201d and that \u201cit appears we will come up a little short.\u201d",
      "The election comes amid Democratic infighting and a torrent of frustration and anger over Senate Democrats in Washington, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer, ensuring the passage of a Trump-backed spending measure that rank-and-file Democrats had opposed over provisions they said would give Trump broad discretion on decisions that are traditionally left to Congress.",
      "Schumer said the bill\u2019s passage avoided a government shutdown that would have been worse. Following the vote, internal dissension burst into the open, with tension unusually high following a November election in which Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate, and failed to win the narrowly divided House.",

      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",
      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",
      "Despite the uncertainties, the OBR's judgement on the economy was better than had been expected. This year's growth was downgraded, but close to normal levels of growth are predicted to return in later years.",

      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",
      "This comes as a result of local authority housing targets and council land being freed up.",
      "When the Planning and Infrastructure Bill passes later this year, which strips back judicial reviews, there should be a further increase in predicted growth.",
      "But the test is obviously actual spades and diggers in the ground and architects' plans being approved. This government is now all-in on Bob the Builder.",
      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",
      "But the cuts to welfare are very real. The 250,000 increase in people in poverty due to the cuts to health-related benefits does not include the impact of recipients getting new jobs.",
      "The Impact Assessment seems to confirm that the aim of the policy is more about saving cash than fundamental reform.",
      "In this and in other areas questions arise about whether the \"OBR tail wags the policy dog\" - i.e. is this really the way long-term policy should be formed?",
      "The big picture is that all of this becomes a lot easier if growth returns and interest costs calm.",
      "In the dreams of Number 11, while we assume the debate in autumn will be about what further tax rises are required, it is possible that by the time of October's Budget, they may not be needed."

      "In October, the OBR said that Reeves had \u00a39.9bn headroom by 2029-30 with regards to day-to-day spending - the amount left over after meeting the fiscal rule.",

      "The \u00a39.9bn is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time has been \u00a330bn.",
      "Regarding the second rule, Reeves said the OBR had forecast it would be met two years early, with a headroom of \u00a315.1bn by 2029-30.",

      "However, Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought the OBR would \"almost certainly have to cut potential growth forecasts\" in the autumn and also expected a rise in planned defence spending by 2027.",
      "\"So further tax hikes and borrowing are coming,\" he said.",
      "The chancellor said the OBR had now taken into account planning reforms and housebuilding targets the government announced in July.",
      "Housebuilding is forecast to hit a 40-year high, with these reforms expected to boost the economy by \u00a36.8bn, according to the independent spending watchdog.",
      "The OBR also raised its forecast for inflation this year to 3.2% but expects the rate of price rises to fall back to the Bank of England's 2% target in 2027.",
      "Real household disposable income per person is expected to grow by an average of around 0.5% a year, the OBR said. The forecaster said stronger wage growth meant this figure was slightly higher than in its previous prediction in October.",
      "Reeves said this meant that by 2029-30 people would be on average more than  \u00a3500 a year better off compared with what the OBR had expected in October."

      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",

      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",

      "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.",
      "But there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.",
      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",
      "Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.",

      "It added that the number of new homes annually was projected to reach a 40-year high of 305,000.",
      "The watchdog estimated the boost to housebuilding as a result of the reforms would increase the size of the UK economy by 0.2% by 2029/30, worth around \u00a36.8bn in today's prices.",
      "The government said this was the biggest positive effect on growth from a  \"zero-cost policy\" the OBR had ever forecast.",
      "The boost to economic growth is driven by factors including higher productivity in the construction sector, more people paying rent and making it easier for people to move for work.",
      "The OBR said the increase in supply would lead to a small reduction in average house prices of around 0.9% by 2029/30.",

      "The ONS said another factor was an unseasonably high number of clothing sales. Discounting usually drops off in February as January sales end and spring ranges enter the shops, but that did not happen this year.",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",

      "He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to \u00a312.21 an hour but he had lost his \u00a31.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\".",
      "''The \u00a31.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC.",

      "In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\"",
      "The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\".",
      "'Attempt to offload drivers'",
      "Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April.",

''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.''",
      "Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit.",
      "In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\".",
      "It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.",
      "The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\".",

      "The Ministry for Housing said on Monday the Building Safety Levy would be introduced from autumn 2026, rather than this year.",
      "The tax on new homes is expected to raise \u00a33.4bn to be spent on building safety, including efforts to take down dangerous cladding.",
      "The delay comes after developers said the tax could increase building costs and result in the government missing its target to build 1.5 million homes by 2030.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told LBC the government was still committed to the tax and insisted the delay would not slow down the pace of improving building safety.",
      "\"The previous government left us with an unpalatable inheritance in that respect,\" Pennycook said.",
      "\"We've got to increase ther pace of works being done. Leaseholders are still trapped in these buildings.\"",
      "Neil Jefferson, chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, welcomed the delay as \"recognition from government that these additional costs will inevitably constrain housing supply\".",
      "But he suggested the \"grossly unfair\" tax on housing developers should be scrapped altogether.",
      "He said: \"As proposed it will add thousands of pounds to the cost of new homes, threatening the viability of sites across swathes of the country at a time when industry is striving to reverse the decline in homebuilding numbers that we have seen in recent years.\"",
      "Cladding removal plan not ambitious enough, say MPs",
      "New deadlines set for fixing dangerous cladding",
      "The tax was first announced in 2021 by the then-Conservative government.",
      "Some of the money raised from the tax will go towards the removal of dangerous cladding from buildings, following the deadly fire at Grenfell Tower.",
      "Ministers have set aside \u00a35.1bn to resolve the cladding crisis, expecting developers, building owners and social housing providers to pay the rest.",
      "Thousands of homes have been made safe, but as of December last year, work had yet to start on a quarter of the 1,323 tall buildings requiring attention.",
      "Up to 12,000 buildings and three million people could be affected.",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",

      "But in a letter to Rayner, dozens of developers said \"the ability of the industry to invest in increasing the supply of new homes to meet the government's 1.5 million target is being threatened by the imposition of new taxes\".",
      "Housebuilders say they are already paying \u00a36.5bn towards improving building safety through corporation tax and argue makers of unsafe cladding should bear more of the costs.",

      "A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"This government is determined to make Britain's homes safer by making developers pay their fair share to fix unsafe buildings through the Building Safety Levy.",
      "\"We have extended the timeline to give developers more time to factor levy costs into their plans while continuing to support them to build safe homes, and at the same time we are continuing to work quickly to fix buildings with unsafe cladding through our Remediation Acceleration Plan.\""

      "But late on Tuesday, it emerged that she would widen her cuts to welfare after the OBR, which monitors the government's spending plans, estimated the already-announced welfare system reforms would not save the \u00a35bn as planned.",
      "The reforms include stricter tests for personal independence (Pip) payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants.",
      "But it is understood the OBR assessed that many claimants facing losing health-related benefit payments would instead claim for more severe conditions.",

      "Some Labour MPs who stayed publicly loyal and had difficult conversations with anxious constituents and annoyed activists have privately expressed frustration at the news.",
      "In her Spring Statement, Reeves will say she is \"proud\" of what Labour has delivered in its nine months in power.",

      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",

      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",

      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",

    "summary": "AI could allow job hunters to get work they are not \"capable\" of doing, a business owner says.",
    "story": [
      "A growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in job applications risks employers hiring candidates who cannot do the work, a business owner has said.",
      "Advertising boss James Robinson said he and other business leaders were seeing a \"real trend\" in applicants using generative AI chatbots, and warned that candidates who were good at using the technology could \"engineer\" the process without being \"capable of doing the job\".",
      "Careers adviser Megan Cooper said that while AI could be a useful tool for job hunters, it should never replace \"human judgement\".",
      "A recent survey of more than 2,000 job applicants in the UK found just under half had used AI to help them with the application process.",
      "Why employees smuggle AI into work",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Mr Robinson, who runs Hello Starling, a Cardiff-based advertising agency, said vacancies at his business were attracting applications that were riddled with AI-generated sentences.",
      "\"There are some common sentences that we see. People are always trying to 'leverage their skillset',\" he said.",
      "\"They're often saying things like 'my skills align with your organisation's objectives and goals'.\"",
      "He said the chatbot ChatGPT confirmed that these were phrases it was likely to generate for a covering letter.",
      "\"[It is] very difficult for me to try and work out who is real, versus which ones are robots,\" he admitted.",
      "Mr Robinson shared his experiences of receiving AI-generated job applications on LinkedIn and said the responses from other business leaders \"really surprised\" him.",
      "\"I was really, really surprised to receive messages from people saying, 'I'm in exactly the same boat as you. How are we going to tell them apart?'",
      "\"You know, 'do we need to be using AI to fight against this and get on top of it?'",
      "\"So I think it is a real challenge in itself, but I don't think that I'm alone.\"",
      "Mr Robinson said however that \"appropriate\" use of AI could help his business, and that the technology was helping applicants to be more succinct in their applications.",
      "What is AI?",
      "AI allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human.",
      "Computers cannot think, empathise or reason, but scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.",
      "Generative AI is used to create new content which can feel like it has been made by a human. It does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.",
      "At Cardiff Metropolitan University, careers advisor Megan Cooper said she was trying to steer students through the ethics of using AI as they applied for jobs.",
      "\"AI can be used as a tool. It can be used as an aid. It's something that can complement, but absolutely not replace, human judgement,\" said Ms Cooper.",
      "Ms Cooper said that in many cases, students were responding to an expectation from employers that candidates understood Generative AI and could use it with confidence.",
      "\"They don't want to be seen as cheating or getting it wrong in any way at all.\"",
      "She said the university was encouraging students to understand when it was appropriate to use AI.",
      "\"Maybe that's in the research stages of the application process. It might be asking AI to give feedback or help structure their CV.",
      "\"Maybe it's asking AI to help read a cover letter that they have already written to help refine it and help it sound a little bit more eloquent.\"",
      "Ultimately the job interview process required applicants to ensure \"what makes them unique is able to shine through\", she added.",
      "'It's too much of a risk'",
      "Student Jasmine James, 18, said she was avoiding using AI for her university work.",
      "\"I feel like it's too much of a risk, with plagiarism and stuff like that,\" she said.",
      "\"But I can understand why people do use it, because it is a quicker and easier alternative.",
      "\"I just feel like the information isn't always correct, so it's best to avoid it for uni work.\"",
      "Fellow student Jacob Morgan, 19, said he believed AI could be a \"really helpful tool\".",
      "\"I use it a lot, especially instead of Google. Sometimes I'll just search up on AI instead, because you get better results. So it's definitely very useful,\" he said.",
      "AI technology was \"here to stay\" and \"it's only going to get better and better\", he added.",
      "Timothy Mitchell, who is in his second year of studying computer security at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said he believed those who did not use artificial intelligence were \"cheating themselves\".",
      "\"Everybody uses it. Tutors use it, employers use it,\" he said.",
      "Mr Mitchell accepted there were \"definitely some fears\" around the wider use of AI, \"but I personally believe they are somewhat unfounded\".",
      "He added: \"What humans are best at is the creative stuff and creating new things. And AI, by principle, can't think beyond what it's been taught.\"",
      "Generative AI could be used \"in a way that aids us rather than replaces us\", he added.",
      "Will AI make work burnout worse?",
      "Biased AI rejected my job applications, says ex-MP",
      "Will AI dream up the hit TV shows of the future?"

      "The\u00a0Post\u00a0Office\u00a0is being removed from one of the schemes set up to compensate victims of the Horizon IT scandal.",
      "The\u00a0government\u00a0will\u00a0now take\u00a0over\u00a0responsibility for the\u00a0Overturned\u00a0Convictions\u00a0Scheme, which provides redress for those who have had their convictions quashed",
      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "However, the government stopped short of taking control of a separate scheme for people who believe they experienced financial shortfalls, despite it being a key recommendation of the Business and Trade Committee report.",
      "The committee has asked ministers to revise their response.",
      "It is yet another twist in the long-running Post Office scandal.",
      "Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",
      "We've broken down how they work.",
      "What are the main compensation schemes?",
      "There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.",
      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January.But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",
      "The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.",
      "A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.",

      "Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.",
      "In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.",
      "It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.",
      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",
      "It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "Around \u00a3315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.",
      "How many people are eligible for compensation overall?",
      "The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.",
      "It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.",
      "What about people who died before receiving compensation?",
      "On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on US imports from countries that purchase oil from Venezuela.",
      "Trump described the move as a \"secondary tariff\" aimed at punishing the Latin American country \"for numerous reasons\", including allegedly \"purposefully\" sending gang members to the US.",
      "Separately, Trump suggested he was softening his plans for tariffs on imports from other countries, saying he \"may give a lot of countries breaks\".",
      "Markets ended the day higher after the comments, which appeared to confirm reports that he was narrowing the taxes he plans to announce on 2 April.",
      "Trump has previously said he was looking to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries around the world, outlining plans for a system whereby \"they charge us, we charge them\".",
      "But on Monday he suggested the White House might be \"nicer than that\" when it came to the new tariff rates.",
      "\"We may take less than what they're charging because they've charged us so much, I don't think they could take it,\" he said, while also acknowledging that some countries might be spared from the measures.",
      "Leading share indexes in the US, which have fallen steeply in recent weeks following Trump's tariff threats, all rose on Monday.",
      "The S&P 500 closed 1.7% higher, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.2% while the Nasdaq finished 2.2% ahead.",
      "Trump cancels oil deal in major blow to Venezuela",
      "US deportations to Venezuela resume after dispute",
      "Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by the company that is buying the goods as opposed to the overseas business that is selling the product.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly used tariffs - or the threat of them - in an attempt to gain leverage in a range of disputes, only some of which are related to trade.",
      "He said on Monday he still planned to impose tariffs on specific products, including cars, lumber and computer chips, claiming the possibility of such measures were already helping to spur investment in the US.",
      "His latest threat against Venezuela is expected to raise pressure on current buyers of oil - which include China, India and Spain - to reduce their dealings in the country, which have provided a critical financial lifeline to the Venezuelan government.",
      "Trump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February.  He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.",
      "For Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. But Venezuela is not a big source of crude for China, which imported more than 11 million barrels per day last year.",
      "The US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron.",
      "The Trump administration has previously signalled its intention to end those exemptions.",
      "On Monday, the administration updated its order, giving Chevron until 27 May to wind down its operations in Venezuela, extending the deadline by two months.",
      "Chevron declined to comment.",

    "story": [
      "The prime minister has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the closure of Heathrow Airport as a result of a power cut caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC \"there are questions\" for bosses of the UK's largest airport to answer over the 18-hour long closure on Friday, which disrupted the journeys of some 200,000 passengers.",
      "On Monday, Heathrow defended its decision to shut down following claims that it did have enough power to operate after the substation fire.",
      "The airport said it had to ground flights due to the time it took to switch from the damaged substation to two alternative power supplies, but added \"lessons can and will be learned\".",
      "The impact of Friday's fire from a single power source has raised questions over Heathrow's resilience and disaster plans, which sees thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade pass through its four terminals on a daily basis.",
      "The airport, along with National Grid, which oversees the UK's electricity network, agreed the impact of fire which broke out at the substation in Hayes was unprecedented.",
      "But John Pettigrew, chief executive of National Grid, told the Financial Times that two other substations remained operational and capable of powering the airport.",
      "He said he could not recall a transformer failing to such an extent in his 30-year career, but said there was a \"level of resilience\" provided by two other substations.",
      "\"Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow,\" he said.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, Sir Keir said there were still unanswered questions.",
      "\"I don't want to see an airport as important as Heathrow going down in the way it did on Friday, so I'm not comfortable with that for one second,\" he added.",
      "An investigation has been ordered by the government to establish what happened, with initial findings to be provided within six weeks.",
      "An internal review of the airport's crisis management plans and its response will also be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow's board.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC the airport's \"well designed\" resilience plans had worked as intended, but added they were never designed to protect the entire energy supply for the whole airport.",
      "Asked if she had confidence in Heathrow's leadership team after reports some senior management went back to bed, leaving the decision to close the airport to more junior executives, Alexander said it was \"not a matter for me\".",
      "She said she understood Heathrow's chief operating officer, Javier Echave, was \"taking some of the critical decisions\" early on Friday, but that she got a \"pretty much instantaneous response\" when she requested to speak to the chief executive Thomas Woldbye.",
      "\"The individuals who need to ask themselves whether they have full confidence in Heathrow management are the Heathrow board,\" the transport secretary added.",
      "The BBC has contacted the airport regarding the reports.",
      "Investigation ordered into power outage that closed Heathrow",
      "National Grid boss says Heathrow had 'enough power'",
      "Heathrow has emergency back-up power supplies, which use diesel generators and batteries, but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.",
      "A separate biomass power generator also provides heat and electricity to Terminal Two.",
      "The airport's chief executive, Mr Woldbye, has said a back-up transformer failed during the power cut, meaning systems had to be shut down before power could be restored.",
      "Heathrow managers decided to close the airport on safety grounds while they switched to the alternative National Grid supplies.",
      "\"Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge,\" a spokesperson said on Monday.",
      "\"Our objective was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire.\"",
      "The length of the shutdown infuriated airlines, which had to pay for the cost of refunding and rebooking customers as well as putting stranded passengers up in hotels and covering food expenses.",
      "Heathrow closure: What are my rights?",
      "Heathrow closure: What are my rights?",
      "Willie Walsh, the former British Airways boss and head of the airline organisation IATA said on Friday it was a \"clear planning failure by the airport\".",
      "The BBC has since contacted the major airlines operating out of Heathrow's terminals to ask how much Friday's closure cost, but all approached have declined to comment or not responded.",
      "It is understood there are concerns within the industry however that there is no mechanism of recouping such costs from the airport responsible, when disruption to flights is out of the control of airlines."

    "story": [
      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",
      "According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.",
      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",
      "Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.",
      "By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.",
      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",
      "Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a \"pothole sticking plaster\".",
      "He said: \"Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",

    "summary": "Questions have been raised over what caused the outage and why back-up systems failed?",
    "story": [
      "It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports.",
      "The disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure.",
      "Disaster recovery plans keep the top brass of many organisations awake at night.",
      "Banks, data centres, stock exchanges, hospitals, all have contingency plans.",
      "\"How is it that critical infrastructure - of national and global importance - is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?\", said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association,  which represents airlines.",
      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",
      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",
      "A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.",
      "The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.",
      "There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.",
      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",
      "\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.",
      "In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.",
      "It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.",
      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only as important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",
      "Questions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.",
      "Additional reporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.",
      "Update 22 March: This article has been corrected to amend a reference to the amount of trade goods affected by the closure of Heathrow. It was millions of pounds worth of trade goods, not millions of tonnes as we originally stated."

    "story": [
      "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.",
      "To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.",
      "But he got much more attention than he bargained for.",
      "Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.",
      "The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.",
      "Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.",
      "\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.",
      "Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.",
      "Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.",
      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",
      "Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.",
      "Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.",
      "And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .",
      "The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.",
      "In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.",
      "GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".",
      "In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.",
      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",
      "So what's next?",
      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",
      "\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",
      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",
      "Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.",

      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "story": [
      "Universities could face multi-million-pound fines for breaches of freedom of speech rules, the Office for Students (OfS) said.",
      "The University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 after the OfS said its equality policy - which included rules to \"positively represent trans people\" - could prevent staff and students voicing opposing views. Sussex was investigated after Prof Kathleen Stock left the university in 2021 accused of transphobia.",
      "Arif Ahmed, OfS director for freedom of speech, said the fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\".",
      "Universities have told the OfS they were concerned about how to uphold free speech while preventing hate speech.",
      "The University of Sussex was the first to be fined under new powers given to the OfS in January.",
      "The higher education regulator's investigation examined the university's trans and non-binary equality policy, which said that course material must \"positively represent trans people and trans lives\" and also said \"transphobic propaganda... [would] not be tolerated\".",
      "The watchdog said the \"chilling effect\" this would have on anyone wanting to voice an opposing view meant the university failed in its duty to uphold freedom of speech on campus.",
      "The University of Sussex plans to legally challenge the OfS findings, vice-chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil said.",
      "The OfS investigation into the University of Sussex started with the case of Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues.",
      "The OfS report concluded that Prof Stock \"felt unable to teach certain topics\" and feared disciplinary action as a result of the university's policy.",
      "Describing the judgement as an \"unreasonably absolutist definition of free speech\", the university said the ruling would leave institutions \"powerless to prevent abusive, bullying and harassing speech\".",
      "The OfS, it added, had pursued a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\" against the university.",
      "It also said the OfS had failed to respond to the university's requests to engage with its staff in person, with Prof Roseneil describing the investigation as a \"trawl of documents\".",
      "But Dr Ahmed defended the investigation and its ruling on Wednesday, saying that \"we communicated with them and they communicated with us\".",
      "He added: \"I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.\"",
      "The report said maximum penalties for universities would be capped at whichever is higher: 2% of a university's annual \"qualifying income\" - the amount they receive from tuition fees and OfS grants - or \u00a3500,000.",
      "Many universities post incomes in the hundreds of millions every year, meaning maximum fines could comfortably reach seven figures.",
      "The University of Sussex fine was capped at \u00a34.6m, the OfS said, adding that an \"appropriate deterrent\" against future breaches could be achieved with the lower fine.",
      "\"Clearly, future cases will not be the first case of their kind, so there will be a potential for higher fines in the future,\" Dr Ahmed said on Wednesday.",
      "The OfS was given the power to issue fines where freedom of speech was not upheld at a university in January.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson described free speech and academic freedom as \"non-negotiables\" in universities, adding that the OfS would get stronger powers to handle such cases so that students and academics are not \"muzzled\" by restraints on free speech.",

      "She originally applied for her CETV in August 2023 but is still waiting. She said the December update claiming that the backlog would be cleared by the end of February made her \"hopeful\", but that since then she has been met with a \"stony silence\".",

    "story": [
      "Five years ago, schools and nurseries across the UK closed to most children as the first Covid-19 lockdown began. A year of online learning, bubbles, flow tests and little social contact followed and school leaders say they are still dealing with the impact - rises in special educational needs (Sen), exclusions, absenteeism and a wider attainment gap between pupils from different socio-economic backgrounds.",
      "'Daily battle'",
      "In a classroom in Luton, 27 children are reciting their school values. They include being kind to their friends and reflecting on their feelings, which has proven a challenge for many.",
      "These five and six-year-olds are in Year 1 at Chantry Primary Academy and their teacher, Feroza Turk, believes they are the age group most affected by the pandemic.",
      "\"We've seen a big rise in special educational needs,\" she said.  \"It's particularly speech and language development and how they interact with each other.",
      "\"It's a daily battle to get them to use kind hands [a method of teaching kindness and appropriate behaviour] and many of them have attachment issues because they had their parents with them all through Covid.\"",
      "The school is run by the Pioneer Learning Trust and its chief executive Cori Bateman said the rise in additional needs since 2020 has forced them to completely change how they teach.",
      "\"What we used to do for one or two children, we're now doing for the whole class,\" she said.",
      "\"We just don't have the staff to give one-to-one support anymore because there are so many children who need it.\"",
      "All learning is now broken down to be Sen-inclusive. Ms Bateman insists the approach does not disadvantage pupils who do not have special educational needs.",
      "The school has also introduced class breathing exercises, ear defenders and sensory gadgets which they believe help some children to concentrate.",
      "Pupils explain their feelings by attaching a peg to a picture of a character who is happy, angry or sad.",
      "Nationally, the number of children receiving Sen support has been rising steadily since 2016.",
      "Now, some 14.1% of primary school students have Sen support and 3% have more complex Education Health Care Plans (EHCPs).",
      "At Chantry Primary the Year 1 figures are 31% and 7.1% respectively.",
      "But how much is the pandemic to blame?",
      "\"We have a strong reputation for Sen teaching, so families choose us, which raises our figures,\" Ms Bateman said.",
      "\"But the clear rise in speech, language and social communication difficulties, I feel, has been because of the pandemic.",
      "\"We know that from nine to 18 months old children really start to notice their wider world but, without toddler groups and health visits, those children and families lost so much support at a key time.",
      "\"They've started school unable to fasten their zips, or understand tone of voice.",

      "\"We definitely saw more challenging behaviour after the pandemic and a rise in exclusions, but that has started to come down now,\" said its principal, Peter Law.",
      "\"Pupil attendance is lower. There's a legacy that 'work can be done online, so you don't have to go to school' and it's a challenge to restore that contract with some parents,\" said Mr Law.",
      "\"The pandemic was an amplifier of situations so we saw plenty of families thrive,  but for those with less supportive situations, children didn't have supervision because parents were working, and some drifted into more difficult situations and saw content online that was unhelpful.\"",

      "Having had to do schoolwork at home from March 2020 until the summer term or September, a second lockdown was introduced in January 2021 - with many children having only just gone back to school after the Christmas holiday.",
      "\"I moved from primary to secondary school in the pandemic,\" said Freya.",
      "\"In my first term here, everyone was in bubbles and not used to talking to people, so it was hard to make friends and then we were back at home again [in 2021] with online learning where you could only see the teacher.",
      "\"It was isolating and demotivating. I think it affected a lot of my age group.\"",
      "Max, 17, believes his year was the \"luckiest\" in the pandemic.",
      "\"We were in Year 8 so we'd done our SATS, made good friends, and GCSEs didn't start until Year 10 so this was the best year of education to miss,\" he said.",
      "Max did not think his A-Levels would be affected by any \"lost\" learning, but said his GCSEs were.",
      "\"I definitely took a hit in maths in Covid and it didn't recover because the GCSE builds on what you've learned before,\" he said.",
      "Sarah, 17,  moved to Comberton after the pandemic but she recalled being \"12 at the time and it was so scary\".",

      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",

      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",

      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",

      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",

      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",

      "Ticketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\" with unclear pricing when it put their reunion tour on sale last year, the UK's competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have breached consumer protection law by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.",
      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",

      "\"We welcome the CMA's input in helping make the industry even better for fans.\"",
      "Dynamic pricing denied",
      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",
      "But many fans were left out of pocket, when standard standing tickets advertised at \u00a3135 plus fees were re-labelled \"in demand\" and changed on Ticketmaster to \u00a3355 plus fees.",

      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",

      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",

      "As the controversy raged, Shinde said he did not support the vandalism, but added that \"the other person should also maintain a certain standard\".",
      "\"There is freedom of expression. We understand satire. But there should be a limit,\" he told BBC Marathi.",
      "Kamra is a well-known name in the Indian comedy scene, with his political satire and stand-up shows getting millions of views on social media.",
      "In his latest show - called Naya Bharat (New India) - Kamra refers to Shinde's 2022 defection from the Shiv Sena party which triggered a major political crisis in the state.",
      "The move led to a split in the Shiv Sena - India's Election Commission later recognised Shinde's group as the \"real\" Shiv Sena. The party is now part of the governing coalition in Maharashtra along with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party.",
      "In the show, Kamra sang a parody of a Bollywood song where he indirectly referred to Shinde as a traitor, outraging his supporters.",
      "It's not clear when the show was filmed at the hotel but the reactions this week were swift.",
      "After Shiv Sena workers ransacked the venue, the studio Habitat - which often hosted stand-up comedy shows - said it was shutting down until it figured out \"the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy\".",
      "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Mumbai's civic authorities, also demolished some structures at the hotel, citing alleged building violations.",
      "Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is from the BJP, criticised Kamra, asking him to apologise. \"None of us are against freedom of speech. We support satire or even political satire and we do not paint it differently,\" he said.",
      "Both he and Shinde accused Kamra of speaking on behalf of the opposition.",
      "A lawmaker from Shinde's party also said in a video that Shiv Sena workers would pursue Kamra across the country and he would be forced to leave India.",
      "In his statement, Kamra said he would not \"hide under [his] bed\", waiting for the outrage to die down.",
      "\"As far as I know, it is not against the law to poke fun at our leaders and the circus that is our political system,\" he said.",
      "Opposition leaders have supported Kamra.",
      "Uddhav Thackeray, chief of Shinde's former party - the Shiv Sena (UBT) - said Kamra had not done anything wrong.",
      "\"He stated the facts and voiced the public opinion,\" he added.",
      "Indian comedians have often faced legal action over comments and jokes. In 2021, Munawar Faruqui spent days in jail after being accused of hurting Hindu religious sentiments in jokes that - it turned out - he didn't actually crack.",
      "Actor and comedian Vir Das also faced outrage and police complaints after a show in the US where he described India as a country of two sides where people \"worship women during the day but gang rape them at night\"."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 01:48:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Robbie asked the group to join his stadium tour, after he discovered their music on BBC Radio 2.",
    "story": [
      "Thom Rylance, frontman of indie band The Lottery Winners, has experienced panic attacks since he was a child. But he'd never had one on stage... until last month.",
      "\"I've got this other, outgoing version of me that does the shows, and he just turns up every time,\" the singer explains.",
      "\"I don't really know him, and I think he's brilliant and quite handsome, but when we played Bournemouth, he just didn't come.\"",
      "The panic manifested as \"a tremendous sense of overwhelming dread\", he says, accompanied by sudden shortness of breath and a racing heartbeat.",
      "He isn't sure how, but he survived the gig without anyone noticing.",
      "YouTube footage shows him goading people into singing Reef's Place Your Hands, and taking selfies with fans during the encore.",
      "In his head, though, it was a disaster.",
      "\"I came off stage and I was really apologetic. I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I was awful. I couldn't speak'.",
      "\"And everyone was like, 'What you talking about? It was absolutely fine.'\"",
      "The reaction wasn't entirely unexpected. At the age of 35, Rylance has become adept at masking his anxiety.",
      "It's a topic he addresses frequently (and movingly) on the band's new album, KOKO, whose title is an acronym for \"Keep on keeping on\".",
      "The singer learned the phrase from his grandmother, who used it to comfort him when he was excluded from school.",
      "\"I didn't want to be bad or naughty, but there was something in me [that meant] I couldn't sit through the lessons,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I was expelled and taken away from all my friends, and it made me really sad \u2013 but my gran used to say, 'Keep on keeping on, Thom', and it stuck with me.\"",
      "'Where was my support?'",
      "The singer was belatedly diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, and the sense of relief hit him like a tidal wave.",
      "\"It was like a release of guilt,\" he says. \"Like, nothing I've ever done has ever been my fault!",
      "\"But it also came with a mourning period, where I was looking back and going, 'Where was my support? I didn't have to be a sad child'.",
      "\"I literally remember a teacher saying, 'If you don't do well in your GCSEs then your life is over.' That sent me spiralling because I was like, 'I don't want to be a junkie', you know?",
      "\"So, I've been going into schools recently and talking to kids with ADHD, just to show them that someone who did terribly in education can wake up every day excited and happy and ready for work.\"",
      "Rylance is speaking from Paris, where The Lottery Winners are wrapping up their latest tour.",
      "The band, completed by Robert Lally, Katie Lloyd and Joe Singleton, have been working tirelessly since they formed in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in 2008 \u2013 but success has been a slow grind.",
      "They signed their first record contract with Sire Records in 2016 after boss Seymour Stein (the man responsible for discovering Madonna) called them \"the best band since The Smiths\".",
      "But when he left the label the following year, the group went with him, delaying  their debut album by years.",
      "It finally arrived on British indie label Modern Sky in 2020, a week before the country went into lockdown, making promotion impossible.",
      "Even so, the band's buoyant indie pop songs and engaging online presence (Rylance is one of the funniest and likeable musicians on social media) helped them build a dedicated fanbase.",
      "By 2023, that support was support enough to send their third album, Anxiety Replacement Therapy, to number one, beating releases by The National and Jessie Ware.",
      "For Rylance, who spent his childhood \"feeling like an alien\", it was a huge deal.",
      "\"It's literally a trophy with a number one on it,\" he laughs. \"What bigger symbol of affirmation is there than that?\"",
      "How about being personally invited on tour by Robbie Williams?",
      "That's what happened last October. Robbie heard the band's single You Again on BBC Radio 2 and instantly booked them as his support act this summer.",
      "\"It was a really huge moment for me,\" says Rylance, who made his first public performance singing Williams' song Stronger on a school trip.",
      "\"Robbie's been a huge part of my life, so when he told me, 'I've listened to all of your albums', I was just like, 'What do you mean, Robbie Williams? Why are you saying that to me?'\"",
      "The pair subsequently struck up a firm friendship, and talk almost daily.",
      "\"Robbie's like my therapist,\" says Rylance. \"He's got ADHD as well, so he can relate to the things that overwhelm me.",
      "\"And I can literally ask him anything. I'll be like, 'Robert, how long do I put this pizza in the oven?'\"",
      "But Williams isn't the only famous name in his contacts.",
      "The Lottery Winners have recorded singles with Shaun Ryder, Nickelback and Boy George (\"a mild hit in Greece,\" laughs Rylance), while Noel Gallagher struck up a friendship with Rylance after playing with him last year.",
      "\"These people have always seemed so unreachable,\" he marvels. \"Noel Gallagher is not even... He's barely even a human being!",
      "\"So to have him right there in my phone... I've texted him for advice loads of times.\"",
      "That guiding hand proved crucial last November, when Rylance published an ill-advised tweet criticising musician Kate Nash's campaign to save the live music industry.",
      "He accused Nash of posing as a working class musician, pointing out she'd attended the Brit School - which he mistakenly thought was a private, fee-paying establishment.",
      "\"I wasn't very proud of that, and it ended up in the NME,\" says Rylance. \"They kept contacting me, asking me for a statement, and so I texted Noel, 'What should I do about this, mate?'",
      "\"He was like, 'Just tell them to speak to your new PR officer: Me.",
      "\"'I'll tell them you're too busy being mega to talk to the press.'\"",
      "In the end, Rylance took a different approach, apologising for his comments and offering to work with Nash, but Gallagher's support helped him keep a level head in a tricky moment.",
      "Today, he's still passionate about highlighting the issues around working class access to the arts.",
      "He recalls The Lottery Winners' first gig, at the Collier's Rest Pub in Leigh, 16 years ago.",
      "The venue was so packed that it ran out of beer, but the band were only paid \u00a330, which they immediately spent on a demo tape.",
      "\"I don't know how we did it,\" Rylance says. \"We were really, really poor for a long time.",
      "\"We kept going because we believed in it, but that's not a realistic prospect for a lot of people.",
      "\"If you don't have any money, you can't afford to make mistakes.\"",
      "Even now, the band need help funding their European tour. Last month, they accepted a grant from the UK's Music Export Growth Fund to help pay for visas and transport costs.",
      "\"I wouldn't be in Paris right now without that,\" Rylance admits. \"They match what we spend, and we're willing to invest as much as we can.\"",
      "That's where ADHD can come in handy. Rylance is relentlessly creative, always on the look-out for ways to promote the band. On the album, he even calls ADHD a \"neurospice\" that helps him \"see solutions before problems even arise\".",
      "To that end, he's got a plan to secure a second number one album this week. Since Friday, Lottery Winners have been hosting a pop-up shop in Leigh, with free live music every day and copies of KOKO for sale.",
      "\"I can promise you this, there isn't a single band who'll work harder than us,\" he says.",
      "To paraphrase his gran, they're keen on keeping on."

    "story": [
      "John Cooper Clarke is about to become the first poet to headline a UK arena, and is responsible for the lyrics to one of the world's most streamed songs of recent years. But he has lost none of the sharp-tongued vitriol of his punk origins.",
      "To a sizeable portion of the nation, Clarke's 50-year stream of biting beat poetry and kitchen sink stand-up comedy should qualify him for national treasure status.",
      "He's horrified at the suggestion.",
      "\"I hate that,\" he shoots back. \"I think it sounds like you're knocking on heaven's door.",
      "\"National treasure? Shnational shmeasure. Nah, I hate that. National treasure? Not while I'm alive. Not unless it comes with a generous stipend. Then I'll think about it.\"",
      "This invective is delivered with a sneer, a wink, and finally a cackle of laughter.",
      "The only stipend in his line of work is the antiquated allowance that's given to the poet laureate.",
      "\"What do you get for that, poet laureate? \u00a370 a year and a barrel of sherry? Not interested.\" He cackles loudly again.",
      "Clarke has been too rebellious a figure to be considered for poet laureate and its sherry-based salary, and at the age of 76 he argues he still has time to disqualify himself from being a fully paid-up national treasure.",
      "\"I could yet blot my copy book. I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.\"",
      "For someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.",
      "One honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.",
      "Although not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM.",
      "It was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40.",
      "Many of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.",
      "Clarke has mixed feelings about the results.",
      "\"It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,\" he says.",
      "\"So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.",
      "\"It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.\"",
      "Hostile punk gigs",
      "Two days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.",
      "Has he ever performed in an arena? \"I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,\" he says. \"But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.\"",
      "It will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.",
      "So what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?",
      "\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"",
      "'Somebody up there likes me'",
      "He performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.",
      "However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.",
      "\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"",
      "Clarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.",
      "Fellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his \"spirit of dissent\", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him \"my hero\".",
      "Turner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.",
      "The original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.",
      "Wedding favourite",
      "Clarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.",
      "\"It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,\" he says. \"I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.\"",
      "The Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.",
      "Meanwhile, the poem has also become a popular choice as a wedding reading.",
      "\"I'd be a billionaire if I had a quid for every person that recited that poem at their wedding,\" Clarke remarks.",
      "He may not have that income stream, but he will have got a fraction of a penny for each of the song's three billion streams.",
      "\"It adds up, and then there's the PRS [royalties],\" he says.",

    "summary": "Funding problems meant Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light was almost axed weeks before filming began.",
    "story": [
      "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.",
      "Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.",
      "He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.",
      "Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.",
      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",
      "\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.",
      "She recently told a House of Commons committee she would like to see an uplift in tax relief for high end television, similar to the one already given to the film sector.",

    "summary": "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 could the lasting impact of the pandemic play a part?",
    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",
      "Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\".",
      "\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"",
      "Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.",
      "And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".",
      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",
      "There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.",
      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",
      "\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.",
      "Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.",
      "\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.",
      "Why preserving clubs matters",
      "Cat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.",
      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",
      "But without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.",

      "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.",
      "Those discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.",
      "\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.",
      "\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.",
      "\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"",
      "Thorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.",
      "Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.",
      "But the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.",
      "\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"",
      "His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.",
      "But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.",
      "\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.",
      "\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"",
      "The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.",
      "He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.",
      "\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.",
      "\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.",
      "\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"",
      "These issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.",
      "On Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".",
      "\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.",
      "Thorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.",
      "\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.",
      "\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.",
      "\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"",
      "So what could more radical solutions be?",
      "This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.",
      "Violence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.",
      "Thorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".",
      "\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.",
      "He urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "The writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.",
      "\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.",
      "A ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.",
      "Thorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.",
      "When asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.",

      "A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock's death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures.",
      "Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment.",
      "Ida's mother Sarah Robinson said the behaviour of the trust - which has declined to comment - was \"another kick in the teeth\" while her father Ryan Lock labelled it \"disgusting\".",
      "Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care.",
      "Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said eight opportunities had been missed \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB's maternity services were still evident in November 2019.",
      "The RLI is run by the UHMB trust.",

      "Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents' concerns.",
      "Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not.",
      "In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times.",

      "In 2019, the year of Ida's death, it received \u00a3734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria.",
      "The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The regulator's report rated maternity services as \"inadequate\", with UHMB's score downgraded to three out of 10.",
      "Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019.",
      "'Painting a false picture'",
      "When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was \"disgusting\".",

      "\"I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn't a case of 'What have we done to [make things better]?'",
      "\"It was a case of 'What are we going to say we've done?'\"",

      "\"Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they're actually making improvements underneath,\" he said.",
      "'Not fully compliant'",
      "UHMB's claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme.",
      "The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost \u00a31m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards.",
      "A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care.",
      "The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay \u00a32m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria.",

      "\"However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust's evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years.",

      "\"When Covid arrived, it took too long to adjust our response to a different threat, which was part of the reason we ended up in lockdown,\" Prof Mark Woolhouse, director of the Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa, University of Edinburgh, said.",
      "\"Since the pandemic, there have been many initiatives to better understand the diversity of pandemic threats that the UK and the world may face in the coming years.",
      "\"The UKHSA's pathogen prioritisation exercise is a welcome contribution to this global effort.\"",
      "'Highly spreadable'",
      "A family of viruses called Paramyxoviridae, which includes measles, is on the list.",
      "And this was the type of pandemic threat public-health agencies around the world were most worried about, Prof Woolhouse said.",
      "A novel measles-like virus would be highly spreadable and \"impossible to control by even the strictest lockdown\", making it \"a threat far worse than Covid.\"",
      "\"It would also be considerably more deadly and, unlike Covid, it would be a [major] threat to children,\" Prof Woolhouse said.",

      "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has set out more details about planned benefit cuts as part of her Spring Statement.",

      "Three ways the changes could affect you and your money",
      "Watch: Henry Zeffman on what you need to know...in 58 seconds",
      "What is Pip and how will it change?",
      "Pip is paid to more than 3.6 million people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, which the official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - says will affect around 800,000 people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",
      "The payments for daily living are:",
      "A standard rate of \u00a372.65 per weekAn enhanced rate of \u00a3108.55 per week",
      "A standard rate of \u00a372.65 per week",

      "A standard rate of \u00a328.70 per week",
      "An enhanced rate of \u00a375.75 per week",
      "Pip is usually paid every four weeks and is tax-free. It does not change depending on your savings or income and does not count as income affecting other benefits, or the benefit cap. You can get Pip if you are working.",
      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. You may be reassessed sooner if your circumstances change.",
      "The government plans more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip. However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.",
      "There is a similar but separate benefit in Scotland called the Adult Disability Payment.",
      "'If I lose my benefit payments I'll struggle to get to work'",
      "Starmer says cost of sickness benefits 'devastating'",
      "How is universal credit changing?",
      "The government has also announced changes to universal credit, which is paid to 7.5 million people.",
      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",
      "Who will be affected by the changes?",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that it expects 3.2 million families \u2013 a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the total package of measures, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year.",
      "This includes:",
      "370,000 current Pip recipients who will no longer qualify and 430,000 future Pip recipients who will get less than they would previously have been entitled to, with an average loss of \u00a34,500 per year2.25 million current UC recipients who will be affected by freezing the incapacity top up with an average loss of \u00a3500, although this will be partially offset by the increase in the standard allowance of UC 730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "370,000 current Pip recipients who will no longer qualify and 430,000 future Pip recipients who will get less than they would previously have been entitled to, with an average loss of \u00a34,500 per year",
      "2.25 million current UC recipients who will be affected by freezing the incapacity top up with an average loss of \u00a3500, although this will be partially offset by the increase in the standard allowance of UC",
      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?"

      "This is part of the government's vision for the future of the NHS, soon to be set out in a 10-year plan. In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",
      "Government critics say you cannot reform the NHS unless you reform social care, because it helps get people out of hospital more quickly and prevents some being admitted in the first place.",
      "An independent commission will begin looking at social care reform next month. There will be an interim report, but the final report is not due until 2028.",
      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",

      "The world's first case of bird flu in sheep has been found in the UK, the nation's chief veterinary officer has confirmed.",
      "The exact location of the farm has not been revealed, but a government spokesperson said the case was identified on a site in Yorkshire where bird flu had been confirmed in captive birds.",
      "The spokesperson said the single infected sheep had been \"humanely culled\" and no further cases among the flock were found after \"extensive testing\".",
      "\"There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk to the nation's livestock population,\" they added.",

      "She added: \"While the risk to livestock remains low, I urge all animal owners to ensure scrupulous cleanliness is in place and to report any signs of infection to the Animal Plant Health Agency immediately.\"",

      "All bar one had been asymptomatic, although they warned the infection \"can be serious\".",
      "The infections were detected in people who had \"close and prolonged contact with a large number of infected birds\".",
      "The spokesperson said the disease continued to infect new mammals and spread between them, \"increasing the opportunities the virus has to evolve\".",
      "\"The concern is that these changes in the virus may at some point allow it to spread readily between people.\"",
      "Dr Meera Chand, emerging infection lead at the UK Health Security Agency, said current evidence \"suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people\".",
      "Dr Chand added: \"The risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low.\"",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 1.78 million farmed and captive birds had been culled between November and February due to the spread of the disease across the UK.",
      "A government spokesperson said the infected sheep was a female who had been showing signs of mastitis, an inflammation of the udder tissue.",
      "The lambs of the affected ewe tested negative for bird flu, the spokesperson added.",
      "While this is the first time this virus has been reported in a sheep anywhere in the world, bird flu has previously been detected in livestock in other countries, according to Defra.",
      "According to the American public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases have previously been found in the US in dairy cows.",
      "The National Sheep Association (NSA), which represents the views and interests of sheep producers in the UK, said mixing different animals was \"questionable at the best of times, but should be avoided when England is undergoing a period of mandatory housing measures for poultry due to bird flu outbreaks\".",
      "The Yorkshire farm where the case was found was a smallholding where sheep and poultry were being kept together, a spokesperson added.",
      "NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said the positive case was \"not a threat to food safety of consumers\".",
      "National Farmers' Union president Tom Bradshaw said: \"Farmers are understandably concerned that avian influenza has been found in a sheep.",
      "\"This remains a single case within what is understood to be a backyard flock, and no other infection has been found amongst the remaining sheep.",
      "\"Commercial producers continue to do all they can to protect their animals by following strict biosecurity measures.",

      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",

      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

      "The Spring Statement was meant to be a routine update on the public finances but Reeves has been forced to make more extensive changes after her plans were blown off course by lower growth and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "Reeves used her statement to announce a further \u00a32.2bn for defence, while a target has been set to reduce the administrative costs of government departments by 15% by 2030.",
      "Real household disposable income per person is expected to grow by an average of around 0.5% a year, the OBR said.",
      "Reeves said this meant that by 2029 households would be on average more than \u00a3500 a year better off compared with what the OBR had expected in October.",
      "The Conservatives claimed her statement was an \"emergency budget\" to \"clean up the mess\" created by her decision in October to increase national insurance costs for business and government borrowing to fund public services.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride accused the chancellor of having \"tanked the economy\" due to her \"ineptitude\".",
      "This is hotly disputed by the government who insist they are sticking to rigid \"fiscal rules\" aimed at keeping a lid on borrowing - to prevent a repeat of the economic meltdown seen after Conservative PM Liz Truss's \"mini budget\".",
      "But the OBR - which was set up in 2010 to evaluate the government's figures - said Reeves will only manage to avoid breaking her fiscal rules through billions in public spending cuts.",
      "The government insists the most vulnerable will be protected from spending cuts - but some Labour MPs have accused the chancellor of seeking to balance the books on the backs of the poor and are threatening to vote against the changes.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions' assessment finds that 3.8 million families are set to be on average \u00a3420 per year better off due to the changes.",
      "But the government analysis suggests more than 3 million families will on average be \u00a31,720 a year worse off by 2030 due to benefit cuts.",
      "On social media, Labour MP Jon Trickett said: \"I will not be voting for cuts to poorest people on welfare benefits. The chancellor has other options.",
      "\"Picking on disabled people is not the right thing to do.\"",
      "Another Labour MP, Brian Leishman, said he was \"very disappointed\" with the chancellor's statement, saying \"I'm not on board with that whatsoever\" and confirmed he would not vote in favour.",
      "Reeves also restored the government's \u00a39.9bn \"headroom\" - spare cash it will have by the end of its five year budget period to deal with unexpected developments.",
      "But the OBR says this is a \"very small margin\" and it would not take much to knock the government's finances off course.",
      "The watchdog believes Reeves has just over a 50% chance of meeting her own borrowing and debt rules by the end of the decade.",
      "But Reeves insisted at a news conference that she was determined to keep a grip on the public finances.",
      "\"People should have no doubt about my commitment and how seriously I take the fiscal rules, as I said today they are non-negotiable,\" she told reporters.",
      "She said the government would continue to make the case for free trade, amid the looming threat of US tariffs.",
      "Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper warned the chancellor she was \"flying blind\" into a trade war with Donald Trump that would leave her plans in \"tatters\" and the government should instead seek a new trade deal with the EU.",
      "Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice described the OBR's forecasts as \"delusional\" and said Labour should not rely so much on their advice.",
      "\"We can't keep spending more than we're earning,\" he told BBC Radio 5's Matt Chorley.",
      "\"I'm afraid we're heading to a very difficult place, led by the R-word \u2013 recession.\"",
      "Benefit cuts announced last week were extended after the OBR said they would not raise as much money as the government had expected.",
      "A rise in the standard rate of universal credit will be \u00a31 a week lower than previously announced, and the health element of universal credit - which reflects a limited capability to work - will be frozen at \u00a397 a week until 2029 for existing claimants.",
      "An extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be pushed into relative poverty by the government's changes, according to its own impact assessment.",
      "And an estimated 800,000 people will lose out on personal independent payments (Pips) by 2030.",
      "A further 2.25 million people currently receiving the health top up to universal credit will lose an average of \u00a3500 a year as a result of the freeze, and 730,000 future recipients will lose out.",
      "About 3.9 million households not on the health element of universal credit are expected to gain an average of \u00a3265 a year from the increase to the standard allowance.",
      "But the government stresses there are limits to their estimates because they don't take into account of funding for measures to support those with disabilities into employment.",
      "They also do not take into account the new protections for those with severe lifelong conditions.",

      "There has been some unease in Labour's ranks over the planned savings in the welfare budget.",
      "The government's newly published assessment of the impact of the changes has increased that anxiety.",
      "The contents \u2013 with its estimates of increased poverty levels - show that talk of difficult decisions is not mere ministerial sloganeering.",
      "While polls suggest tackling the benefits bill is popular, voters and Labour MPs tend to be more squeamish when cuts affect disabled people.",
      "The scale of those cuts has led some Labour MPs publicly to declare for the first time today that they won't vote for the welfare changes \u2013 though any rebellion is ultimately likely to be unsuccessful.",
      "Perhaps of greater concern to Chancellor Rachel Reeves is that MPs on her own side are openly challenging her approach,  and putting forward alternatives.",
      "Those around the chancellor had believed that any argument over her iron-clad fiscal rules on debt and borrowing had been won well before polling day.",
      "Many of the new MPs were regarded as leadership loyalists, and it was assumed that they bought the argument that Labour had to kill off any impression that it would tax too highly and spend too much.",
      "It was also assumed they were aware that any major change to rules on borrowing and debt would invite unflattering comparisons with the short-lived regime of former prime minister Liz Truss.",
      "But some Labour MPs are finding an increasing number of difficult decisions are, well \u2013 increasingly difficult.",

      "In the Commons on Wednesday,  the Labour chair of the cross-party work and pensions committee, Debbie Abrahams, supported moves to get people back into work.",
      "But she suggested that some of the changes to benefit levels would undermine rather than bolster elusive growth.",
      "She asked bluntly:  \"How will making people sicker and poorer help in driving our economy up?\"",
      "And left-wing MPs are publicly promoting alternatives. Bradford MP Imran Hussain called for a wealth tax and former frontbencher Andy McDonald demanded a hike in capital gains tax.",
      "Big Labour-supporting unions such as Unite take a similar view.",
      "Privately an MP regarded as being on the right of the party is advocating a temporary tax on wealth until the economy picks up.",
      "And a prominent Labour backbencher \u2013 who chaired a cross-party committee \u2013 had a range of possible options for bringing in more revenue.",
      "They included a council tax revaluation; less pensions tax relief for the better off;  a land tax; a new tax on property owners and not tenants.",
      "That backbench MP was none other than Rachel Reeves herself \u2013 in The Everyday Economy, a pamphlet she penned in 2018.",
      "Think tanks - such as the centrist Social Market Foundation \u2013 have also pushed alternative options such as cancelling the Lower Thames Crossing, taxing empty property, and taking another look at the triple lock, which can lead to inflation-busting increases in state pensions.",
      "But as well as ignoring her younger self,  the current debate the chancellor would really like to extinguish is whether to change - or bypass - her fiscal rules.",
      "These can lead to a spending squeeze in order to convince the Office for Budget Responsibility she's on course to have debt falling and day-to-day spending in balance by the end of the Parliament.",
      "What ignited - or at least re-ignited - the debate was the decision of the German parliament to exempt defence and infrastructure investment from their equivalent rules.",
      "So it's no longer just those on Labour's left who are calling for more flexibility. Some serving ministers privately believe that if \u2013 as the chancellor says \u2013 \"the world has changed\", then her rules can change with it.",
      "One of former prime minister Tony Blair's closest former advisers \u2013 John McTernan \u2013 has advocated an exemption for defence in the New Statesman.",
      "The Fabian Society \u2013 a think tank affiliated to Labour \u2013 has said that if the UK faces further fiscal pressure, the government must look again \"at how it can raise revenue progressively to protect our public services and support the vulnerable\".",
      "Rachel Reeves made it clear in her Spring Statement that her rules \u2013 which she tweaked at the Budget \u2013 were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "And the Treasury insists that following Germany's lead would push up the cost of borrowing \u2013 and therefore mortgages \u2013 even further.",
      "The chancellor has insisted that to ensure economic stability, there is no alternative to her approach.",
      "With fears that stubbornly sluggish growth will lead to more difficult decisions at the autumn Budget, some voices on the left and centre-left are now begging to differ.",

      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",

      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",

      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",

      "When the Planning and Infrastructure Bill passes later this year, which strips back judicial reviews, there should be a further increase in predicted growth.",
      "But the test is obviously actual spades and diggers in the ground and architects' plans being approved. This government is now all-in on Bob the Builder.",
      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",
      "But the cuts to welfare are very real. The 250,000 increase in people in poverty due to the cuts to health-related benefits does not include the impact of recipients getting new jobs.",
      "The Impact Assessment seems to confirm that the aim of the policy is more about saving cash than fundamental reform.",
      "In this and in other areas questions arise about whether the \"OBR tail wags the policy dog\" - i.e. is this really the way long-term policy should be formed?",
      "The big picture is that all of this becomes a lot easier if growth returns and interest costs calm.",
      "In the dreams of Number 11, while we assume the debate in autumn will be about what further tax rises are required, it is possible that by the time of October's Budget, they may not be needed."

      "The government said further planned reforms and investment in affordable housing would help to meet its target of 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "But the OBR warned its estimates were uncertain as factors such as the number of construction workers could hinder progress.",

      "The government said this was the biggest positive effect on growth from a  \"zero-cost policy\" the OBR had ever forecast.",

      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",

      "The regulator said the Trans and Non-Binary Equality Policy Statement issued by the University of Sussex was looked at in the context of existing legal duties on freedom of speech, as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.",

      "Parliamentary officials have launched a separate bullying probe into Lowe. Meanwhile, the Met Police is investigating Lowe after Reform accused him of threatening \"physical violence\" against the party's chairman.",
      "The Great Yarmouth MP denied the claims and said his suspension was a reaction to criticising party leader Nigel Farage.",
      "Following the report's publication, Reform UK told the BBC Lowe had been expelled from the parliamentary party.",
      "Reform is also in the process of cancelling Lowe's party membership.",
      "He was suspended earlier this month, following allegations he had threatened party chairman Zia Yusuf in December.",

      "\"At the very least Mr Lowe should have taken seriously the distress and concerns,\" it added.",
      "Lowe had a \"duty and responsibility to ensure systems were in place to avoid junior members of staff being treated in any unfair and discriminatory way\", she added.",
      "Concluding her report, Ms Perry said there was a \"real risk\" that the alleged treatment could be a breach of the Equality Act.",
      "Ms Perry said her role was not to determine any criminality but to assess the \"veracity\" of the bullying and harassment allegations against Lowe and his staff, determine any legal implications, and recommend measures to prevent future incidents.",
      "She recommended Reform should be \"quite strict\" about ensuring party members were \"fully acquainted\" with parliamentary rules on bullying and discrimination laws.",
      "Lowe had previously claimed that Ms Perry had contacted him to say she found \"no credible\" evidence against him - leading to the KC to contact the BBC to rebut his claims.",
      "Responding to the report, Lowe said in a social media post: \"There was no bullying. There never has been any bullying. Using such claims to damage me through my staff is shameful.\"",

    "summary": "The prime minister says he wants to see government departments become more efficient by using AI and technology.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government can be more efficient by using AI and technology, ahead of the Spring Statement.",
      "Questioned on BBC Radio 5 Live on whether unprotected departments would face cuts, the PM said ministers were \"looking across the board\", but he wanted to challenge government to be more efficient.",
      "Rachel Reeves has confirmed civil service departments will be asked to cut 15% from their budgets, but there is political unease among Labour MPs about the scale of cuts to departments, which the chancellor will outline in her statement on Wednesday.",
      "It comes after the government unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir said the government was \"looking across the board\" at spending, when asked by the BBC whether cuts would be announced for departments whose spending is not protected, such as the Ministry of Justice.",
      "\"At the budget last year we made some record investments, and we're not going to undo that,\" he added, pointing to increased NHS spending.",
      "He said: \"We're essentially asking businesses across the country to be more efficient, to look at AI and tech in the way that they do their business.",
      "\"I want the same challenge in government, which is 'why shouldn't we be more efficient?', so we will be looking there and in one or two other places.\"",
      "The PM was asked by the BBC later if he would consider changing the government's fiscal rules and responded: \"No, because we had to stabilise the economy, which is what we did with the Budget.\"",
      "He added: \"The difference is that the global situation has changed - I think most people would understand that in the last few weeks and months the international insecurity has got very real - that does impact domestically.\"",
      "The chancellor's rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy, are that day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing; and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029/30.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said it was the chancellor's decisions that were the cause of sluggish growth forecasts, leading to the imposition of cuts.",
      "\"We wouldn't be here because we would not have put those confidence-destroying taxes on the economy,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"We would have made different decisions, tackled welfare reform earlier - she's doing that now but if it's a moral mission of this government, why didn't they do it nine months ago?\"",
      "Welfare budget",
      "Reeves' plan for major money-saving from the welfare budget comes on top of her decision to axe the universal provision of winter fuel payments and only give them to the poorest pensioners.",
      "She told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that government running costs would be cut, with savings made from back office and administrative roles rather than front-line services.",
      "Last month, the government cut the international aid budget to boost defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, as leaders across Europe looked to overhaul defence policies over fears the US could make a deal with Russia to end the Ukraine war which leaves the continent vulnerable.",
      "Sir Keir and US President Donald Trump spoke about progress on an economic deal between the UK and US on Sunday night, Downing Street said.",
      "It comes as reports that a digital services tax on tech giants could be slashed or abolished.",
      "On Monday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander denied the government was signalling a return towards an austerity model.",
      "Challenged on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Alexander highlighted that Labour had increased public spending in its first budget in October.",
      "\"We have to take some really very difficult decisions and in terms of welfare we will always make sure that there is a system that provides a safety net for the most vulnerable,\" she said.",
      "\"We're investing over \u00a320bn more in the NHS and we've seen waiting lists coming down in hospitals now for the fifth month in a row.",
      "\"The Office for Budget Responsibility last year at the time of the budget said it was one of the most expansionist budgets ever, of all time, so we are not returning to austerity.\"",
      "Civil Service unions have warned that services could deteriorate with the loss of jobs.",
      "Paul Novak, the general secretary of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), told BBC Radio 4's World at One that \"there are always efficiencies\" to make in the civil service.",
      "But if the government were \"serious about making public services work and delivering for people who make those services work then you've got to look at investing in those services,\" Mr Novak said.",
      "He argued \"you'd be hard pressed to find anybody in the civil service or the public sector who say there is a lot of fat to be trimmed\".",
      "The TUC, which helps represent just under 190,000 civil servants in Public and Commercial Services Union, were a \"long way\" from strike action on proposed changes, Mr Novak said.",
      "The UK civil service workforce is the largest it has been for nearly 20 years, with 548,000 employees, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Numbers swelled by more than 100,000 due to the impact of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.",

    "summary": "A red, amber and green rating system is being produced for English councils on pothole maintenance.",
    "story": [
      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",
      "According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.",
      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",
      "Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.",
      "By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.",
      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",
      "Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a \"pothole sticking plaster\".",
      "He said: \"Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats transport spokesman Paul Kohler called for a \"more sustainable approach\" to repairs, saying fixing individual potholes was welcome but did little to address a \"crumbling road infrastructure\".",

      "She said the size of the Civil Service had increased \"massively\" during Covid and had not returned to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "\"We are,  by the end of this Parliament, making a commitment that we will cut the costs of running government by 15%,\" she said.",
      "Reeves said cutting running costs by this amount was \"more than possible\" given advances in technology and artificial intelligence.",
      "Pressed over how many civil service jobs could go, the chancellor told Sky News staff numbers could be reduced by about 10,000.",
      "As of December 2024, an estimated 547,735 people were employed by the Civil Service according to the Office for National Statistics. This includes temporary and casual employees.",
      "Civil servants are politically impartial officials employed by the government, covering areas including policy development and services like benefits and prisons.",
      "Dave Penman, head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said the distinction between back office and the front line was \"artificial\".",
      "\"The idea that cuts of this scale can be delivered by cutting HR and comms teams is for the birds,\" he said.",
      "\"This plan will require ministers to be honest with the public and their civil servants about the impact this will have on public services.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mike Clancy, head of the Prospect union, said: \"Civil servants in all types of roles help the public and deliver the government's missions.",
      "\"Cutting them will inevitably have an impact that will be noticed by the public.\"",
      "Earlier this month Cabinet Office Minister McFadden promised \"radical\" reform of the Civil Service, with performance-related pay for senior officials and those not meeting expectations incentivised to leave their jobs.",
      "And last week Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer vowed to reshape the \"flabby\" state and \"unshackle\" civil servants from \"bureaucracy\".",
      "Disappointing economic growth, higher borrowing costs and lower-than-expected tax revenues have increased the pressure on the government to find savings.",
      "Earlier this week, the government unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, including making it harder for people to claim disability payments, with the aim of saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "Reeves has signalled she will not raise taxes or government budgets in her Spring Statement next week, telling the BBC this week that \"we can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services\".",
      "She is constrained by self-imposed rules, including not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and seeing debt fall as a share of the UK economic output by 2029/30.",
      "Pressed over whether some departments would see their budgets cut, Reeves said: \"There will be real-terms increases in government spending in every year of this Parliament.\"",
      "However, she refused to confirm whether this would apply to individual unprotected departments like the Ministry of Justice or the Home Office, saying this would be set out in the spending review in June.",
      "The chancellor said every department had been asked to rank their spending from most important to least.",
      "\"We want to put more money into the things that are the most important things for voters, for citizens, and less money on the things that are just not necessary or we should be doing in a different way,\" she added.",
      "Responding to claims from some on the left of the Labour Party that the government's approach amounted to a return to Conservative austerity, Reeves pointed to the \u00a3100bn of extra capital spending and \u00a320bn for the NHS announced in October's Budget.",
      "\"That is a far cry from what we've seen under Conservative governments in the last 14 years,\" she added.",
      "Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour had left the economy \"in a really vulnerable state\".",
      "He told the BBC borrowing costs had risen partly because financial markets \"are twitchy at the way the UK economy has been run over the past nine months\"."

He also said Putin had commissioned a portrait of the US president as a gift and Trump was \"clearly touched by it\".",

      "During his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "He said it was \"correct\" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"",
      "He added: \"There's a sensibility in Russia that Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched together in this sort of mosaic, these regions, and that's what is the root cause, in my opinion, of this war, that Russia regards those five regions as rightfully theirs since World War Two, and that's something nobody wants to talk about.\"",
      "Putin has repeatedly said that the \"root causes\" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.",
      "Witkoff said in the Tucker Carlson interview: \"Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don't need to absorb Ukraine\u2026 They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\"",
      "Asked about Keir Starmer's plans to forge a \"coalition of the willing\" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: \"I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.\"",
      "He said a ceasefire in the Black Sea would be \"implemented over the next week or so\" and \"we are not far away\" from a full 30-day ceasefire.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",
      "Who will be affected by the changes?",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that it expects 3.2 million families \u2013 a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the total package of measures, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year.",
      "This includes:",
      "370,000 current Pip recipients who will no longer qualify and 430,000 future Pip recipients who will get less than they would previously have been entitled to, with an average loss of \u00a34,500 per year2.25 million current UC recipients who will be affected by freezing the incapacity top up with an average loss of \u00a3500, although this will be partially offset by the increase in the standard allowance of UC 730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "370,000 current Pip recipients who will no longer qualify and 430,000 future Pip recipients who will get less than they would previously have been entitled to, with an average loss of \u00a34,500 per year",
      "2.25 million current UC recipients who will be affected by freezing the incapacity top up with an average loss of \u00a3500, although this will be partially offset by the increase in the standard allowance of UC",
      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?"

      "Talk of growth forecasts and self-imposed financial rules may feel very distant from you and your life, but the Spring Statement could affect both your job and your money.",
      "Here's what it could mean for you.",
      "1. Benefit changes",
      "If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.",
      "The changes to the benefits system, announced last week, will see some people lose support from next year, although universal credit payments are set to rise from next April.",
      "This means:",
      "If you claim Personal Independence Payments and do not qualify when the criteria are tightened, then you are likely to be hardest hit. Some 370,000 people are expected to lose their entitlement altogether, and others will receive less than they expected. The average loss is \u00a34,500 a yearEven if you are not affected by the Pip changes, you may still lose out.

      "Other changes to the welfare reforms also mean less money than you may have expected.",
      "For example, the government had said there would be a rise in the standard allowance for universal credit for 6.5 million people.",
      "It will now rise to \u00a3106 a week, for a single claimant aged over 25 in 2029-30, rather than the \u00a3107 previously billed.",
      "The health element of universal credit, which is paid if your ability to work is limited,  was set be halved for new claimants to \u00a350 a week in 2026-27, and will now be frozen thereafter.",
      "Ministers have said that existing claimants will be affected too with their entitlement frozen at \u00a397 a week until 2029-30.",
      "2. Living standards and household bills",
      "The Spring Statement doesn't come in isolation. Next week, a series of household bills will rise.",
      "From 1 April, you will pay more for water, energy and your council tax.",
      "However, if you're over 21 and on the minimum wage then your hourly rate will go up to \u00a312.21 an hour, from the current \u00a311.44.",
      "Nonetheless, the rising cost of living has pushed many of you to your financial limit.",
      "And now the prices you pay are expected to rise at a faster pace this year than previously thought.",
      "Inflation - is expected to average 3.2% this year, according to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before falling to 2.1% in 2026 and then 2% from 2027. The government's target is 2%.",
      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",
      "This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be \u00a3500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards.",
      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

    "story": [
      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",

      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "A rare new species of two-clawed dinosaur has been discovered by scientists in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.",
      "The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.",
      "It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.",
      "Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.",
      "Therizinosaurs were a group of either herbivorous or omnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period, which began 145 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago.",
      "They are exemplified by the massive, long-clawed form Therizinosaurus, featured in the film Jurassic World Dominion, and were \"awkward looking\", according to one of the study's authors Dr Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor at the University of Calgary.",
      "The specimen was recovered from the Bayanshiree formation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which dates back to the Late Cretaceous period (between 100.5 to 66 million years ago).",
      "Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.",
      "The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.",
      "At nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.",
      "Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.",
      "The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods.",
      "The specimen also preserves the first keratinous sheath of a therizinosaur, an element that covers the claw much like human fingernails, aiding defence, movement, or prey catching."

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",
      "You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.",
      "But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary.",
      "Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots.",
      "They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire.",
      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",
      "\"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\"",
      "The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections.",
      "Andrew Woods, senior curator at the museum said: \"This Iron Age hoard is an unprecedented find in the north, which will help us to understand more about this remarkable period in our history.",

    "summary": "On social media a self-proclaimed earthquake predictor says he can forecast big shakes, but experts say it's pure luck.",
    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

      "Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".",
      "\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.",
      "The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.",
      "Ecopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.",
      "\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.",
      "If you are outside of the UK, watch Colombia: Petroleum, Pollution and Paramilitaries on YouTube",
      "If you are outside of the UK, watch Colombia: Petroleum, Pollution and Paramilitaries on YouTube",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.",
      "Colombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.",
      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",
      "The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.",
      "She said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.",
      "It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.",
      "A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.",
      "Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.",
      "\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.",
      "Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.",
      "She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.",
      "The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.",
      "Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".",
      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",
      "\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.",
      "\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"",
      "And Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.",
      "\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026  And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

      "The security app",
      "Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.",
      "Where it does lead the way though is in security.",
      "At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).",
      "Simply put, it means only the sender and the receiver can read messages - even Signal itself cannot access them.",
      "A number of other platforms also have E2EE -  including WhatsApp - but Signal's security features go beyond this.",
      "For example, the code that makes the app work is open source - meaning anybody can check it to make sure there are no vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.",
      "Its owners say it collects far less information from its users, and in particular does not store records of usernames, profile pictures, or the groups people are part of.",
      "There is also no need to dilute these features to make more money: Signal is owned by the Signal Foundation, a US-based non-profit, which relies on donations rather than ad revenue.",

      "\"You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,\" he said.",
      "\"You have to learn that you have to rely on other people for everything.\"",
      "The Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind.",
      "It is what is known as a brain computer interface (BCI) - which works by detecting the tiny electrical impulses generated when humans think about moving, and translating these into digital command, such as moving a cursor on a screen.",

      "When Noland's implant was announced, experts hailed it as a \"significant milestone\", while also cautioning that it would take time to really assess - especially given Musk's adeptness at \"generating publicity for his company.\"",
      "Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\"",
      "In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.",
      "\"I think he was just as excited as I was to get started,\" he said.",
      "Nonetheless, he stresses that Neuralink is about more than its owner, and claims he does not consider it \"an Elon Musk device\".",

      "And - even better - over time his ability to use the implant has grown to the point he can now play chess and video games.",
      "\"I grew up playing games,\" he said - adding it was something he \"had to let go of\" when he became disabled.",

      "But these aren't concerns for Noland - instead he wants to see the chips go further in terms of what they can do.",
      "He told the BBC he hoped the device could eventually allow him to control his wheelchair, or even a futuristic humanoid robot.",
      "Even with the tech in its current, more limited state, it hasn't all been smooth sailing though.",

      "Rather than requiring open brain surgery, it is installed into a person's jugular vein in their neck, then moved up to their brain through a blood vessel.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "story": [
      "Denmark has welcomed changes to a Greenland trip by US Vice-President JD Vance and his wife Usha, which has been reduced to a visit of just a US space base.",
      "Earlier this week, it was announced that Usha Vance would spend several days in Greenland, visiting the capital Nuuk and attending cultural events like a popular annual dogsled race.",
      "The White House said on Tuesday that JD Vance would join his wife in Greenland but that the couple would only spend a day there visiting the US Pituffik Space Base, on the north-western coast.",
      "US President Donald Trump has continued his threats of taking over Greenland, a Danish semi-autonomous territory, saying on Wednesday: \"We're going to have to have it\".",
      "\"We need Greenland for international safety and security,\" Trump added.",
      "Although JD Vance will become the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland,  a visit to a US base is less controversial than the original plan for his wife's visit, which Greenland's acting head of government Mute Egede called a \"provocation\".",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that the decision was \"very positive\" and that Denmark had \"nothing against\" the Americans visiting their own base.",
      "Rasmussen also said it was a \"masterful spin in many ways, to make [the US] look like they're escalating when they're actually deescalating.\"",
      "The revised programme will also likely reduce the risk of the Vances being met with protests by local residents.",
      "In recent weeks hundreds of people have taken part in demonstrations against the US, with some holding placards reading \"Respect international agreements\" and \"Yankee go home\".",
      "Earlier in March, Greenland's leading political parties issued a joint statement to condemn Trump's \"unacceptable behaviour\".",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister Mute B Egede wrote on Facebook that his country would \"never be the USA and we Greenlanders will never be Americans... Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.\"",
      "On Wednesday morning, Greenland media reported that several armoured cars which had arrived on the island in preparation for Usha Vance's visit were being loaded back on an American military plane.",
      "Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.",
      "It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest and a military presence there since World War Two.",
      "The Pituffik Space Base, located in the north-west of Greenland, supports missile warning, air defence and space surveillance missions.",
      "In a video posted on social media platform X on Tuesday, Vance said there was a lot of excitement around his wife's trip to Greenland. He is joining her because he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself\".",
      "He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as \"a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland\".",
      "He added that the Trump administration wanted to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland\", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for \"far too long\".",
      "It is unclear if Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz is still scheduled to visit. The BBC has reached out to the White House for confirmation.",
      "Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of Polar Research and Policy Initiative think tank, based in London, criticised the visit.",
      "He said it was \"highly unusual\" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.",
      "The US' interest in Greenland's security, given its strategic importance, makes sense, he said. But he added that it is \"inexplicable\" for Washington DC to have taken such an aggressive approach, especially in light of Trump's comments about acquiring the territory.",
      "\"Disrespecting the people of Greenland by saying the US will acquire it 'one way or the other' is unhelpful and counter-productive as a tactic,\" he added.",

      "Ozgur Ozel, chairman of the mayor's Republican People's Party (CHP), said the nationwide protests would include a very large demonstration this Saturday in Istanbul. That will open the party's campaign to make Imamoglu the country's next president in elections that are due in 2028, he said.",
      "\"In every city we go to, we will have the biggest rallies in their history,\" Ozel declared.",

      "Alongside the mass demonstrations, there have also been mass arrests - more than 1,400 people and counting, including seven Turkish journalists who were reporting on the protests.",
      "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has plenty of strong supporters, has condemned the demonstrations as \"street terrorism\" and accused protesters of attacking the police and damaging public property.",
      "He said the opposition's \"show\" would eventually fade.",

      "Imamoglu denies all the charges against him, including \"establishing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, and rigging a public tender\".",
      "He says his arrest was a coup. Turkish officials say the courts here are independent. Human rights organisations strongly dispute that.",
      "Ozel said Imamoglu was arrested for one simple reason \u2013 to prevent him becoming Turkey's next president. Opinion polls suggest the mayor might be able to do that \u2013 if he's not behind bars.",
      "\"Erdogan has thrown a three-time election winner in jail\u2026 in front of the whole world,\" Ozel said.",
      "\"Suddenly he is jailing someone who is fighting against him in a normal political way. It's like your rival coming and slicing the ball in a football game, because you are winning.\"",
      "The opposition party believes the response of Turkish society and the international community will be key in deciding if Imamoglu remains behind bars.",
      "But Ozel said the CHP felt \"abandoned\" by the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his party.",
      "\"While all of Europe is reacting, the English Labour Party, and Starmer have said nothing. The cradle of democracy - England - and our brother party, the Labour party, how can they stay silent? We are really hurt.\"",

    "story": [
      "South Korean governments committed numerous human rights violations over decades in a controversial programme that sent at least 170,000 children and babies abroad for adoption, a landmark inquiry has found.",
      "It said the government's lack of oversight enabled the \"mass exportation of children\" by private agencies that were driven by profit, and found examples of fraud, falsified records and coercion.",

      "\"This is a shameful part of our history,\" said Park Sun-young, the chairperson of the commission, at a press briefing.",
      "\"While many adoptees were fortunate to grow up in loving families, others suffered great hardship and trauma due to flawed adoption processes. Even today, many continue to face challenges.\"",
      "The report was released on Wednesday by the independent Truth and Reconciliation Commission following an investigation that began in 2022.",
      "Since then, 367 adoptees - all of which were sent overseas between 1964 and 1999 - had filed petitions alleging fradulent practices in their adoption process.",

      "South Korea's government then began a transnational adoption programme handled by private agencies, which were given significant powers through special adoption laws.",
      "But there was a \"systemic failure in oversight and management\", which led to numerous lapses committed by these agencies, according to the report.",
      "The report noted that foreign agencies had demanded a set number of children every month and Korean agencies complied, \"facilitating large-scale intercountry adoptions with minimal procedural oversight\".",
      "With no government regulation on fees, the Korean agencies charged large amounts and demanded \"donations\", which turned adoptions into \"a profit-driven industry\", according to the report.",
      "Other lapses include adoptions conducted without proper consent from birth mothers and inadequate screening of adoptive parents.",
      "The agencies also fabricated reports that made children appear as if they were abandoned and put up for adoption; and intentionally gave children wrong identities.",
      "Because many adoptees had false identities listed in their paperwork, they now struggle to obtain information about their birth families and are left with inadequate legal protection, the report noted.",
      "The commission has recommended the government deliver an official apology, and to comply with international standards on transnational adoptions.",
      "'I have had a painful and miserable life'",
      "South Korea has moved to tighten its adoption processes in recent years. In 2023, it passed a law ensuring that all overseas adoptions would be handled by a government ministry instead of private agencies, which is due to come into effect by July.",

      "The couple, who were in their 50s at the time, had initially applied to adopt but were rejected by Norwegian authorities as they were too old.",
      "They then travelled to South Korea and visited an orphanage, where they selected Inger-Tone and took her with them to Norway.",
      "The couple only submitted an adoption application to Norwegian authorities years later. The authorities approved it, despite acknowledging the illegality of Inger-Tone's situation, because they determined that by then she had \"no connection to Korea anymore\".",

      "\"They took better care of the dog than they ever did of me,\" she said. \"It was so painful. I wasn't able to talk or express myself, other than crying at night\".",
      "In 2022, she successfully sued her local government in Norway and was awarded damages. She also received her local government's acknowledgment that it was liable for \"failing to supervise\" her adoptive home.",

      "\"They have never spent time in prison for what they've done to me. They criminally picked up a child outside of the country... nobody has taken responsibility for what they did to me,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?",
      "At 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.",
      "Exhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.",
      "The United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.",
      "Almost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.",
      "\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"",
      "It was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.",
      "There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.",
      "It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had.",
      "The United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image.",
      "The baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.",
      "Yet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.",
      "Donald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.",
      "The question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?",
      "A challenge to the Truman legacy",
      "President Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.",
      "\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?",
      "\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"",
      "It's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration.",
      "And the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.",
      "In the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"",
      "Another account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",
      "Trump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia.",
      "Many saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.",
      "On the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share.",
      "To some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".",
      "The United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for.",
      "Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end.",
      "\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"",
      "\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"",
      "Nato Article 5 'is on life support'",
      "The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.",
      "\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.",
      "For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all.",
      "In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.",
      "Others are less sure.",
      "Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support.",
      "\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.",
      "\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"",
      "According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.",
      "\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.",
      "\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".",
      "And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"",
      "Has a 'fragmentation of the West' begun?",
      "All of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"",
      "In early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".",
      "\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.",
      "\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"",
      "'We forgot the lessons of our history'",
      "One of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed.",
      "Britain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)",
      "\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.",
      "\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"",
      "The prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?",
      "\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"",
      "Then there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.",
      "\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"",
      "But Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.",
      "Others share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.",
      "\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"",
      "Mr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"",
      "Piecing together a new world order",
      "There is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash.",
      "\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.",
      "\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"",
      "The question is how to achieve this.",

    "story": [
      "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
      "Now, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.",
      "In a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\".",
      "The findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.",
      "Mr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".",
      "\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\".",
      "\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"",
      "Feminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\".",
      "Chakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death.",
      "Perhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".",
      "Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.",
      "Chakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death.",
      "\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief.",
      "But within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues.",
      "The Rajput family has not commented on the latest developments regarding his death.",
      "Chakraborty, who consistently denied all the allegations against her, appealed to the government to order a fair probe into the death.",

      "Why is Indian TV obsessed with Sushant Singh Rajput's death?",
      "However, the tragedy - which came in the midst of a lockdown while India was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic - became the biggest prime-time story for a nation glued to their television sets.",
      "And Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.",
      "Some of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\".",
      "A video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt.",
      "The vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.",
      "She was released a month later and has since tried her hand at motivational speaking and has now reinvented herself as a businesswoman who has launched a clothing line and her own podcast with celebrity interviews. She is also doing a reality TV show.",
      "Chakraborty has also spoken about her ordeal, including how the name-calling and character assassination cost her work and how her family were also hounded.",
      "\"I tried contacting people in the [Hindi film] industry, asking for roles, any roles. But then I realised that people won't cast you because of all that had happened,\" she told Humans of Bombay last year.",
      "\"I was very angry for a long time. But it gave me acidity and I suffered from gut issues. So, it became important for me to forgive,\" she said, adding \" I have not forgiven everyone. Some people are on my hit list.",
      "It is not clear what action she is contemplating against those who vilified her, but many are now suggesting on social media that she sue them for damages.",
      "While neither the actress or her lawyer have not yet said what they intend to do, columnist Namita Bhandare points out that seeking compensation in India, with its overburdened judiciary and millions of pending court cases, is anything but easy.",
      "\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"",
      "According to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".",
      "What happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\".",
      "Some of the videos of prominent news anchors making slanderous comments against Chakraborty have now resurfaced, and are being shared extensively on social media. Many people, including some of the actress's Bollywood colleagues, are demanding that the presenters apologise to her.",

    "summary": "Ukraine long-range drone makers are worried Russia will use the ceasefire to gather strength and attack again.",
    "story": [
      "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.",
      "The machine, which looks like a mini plane with wings, is placed on a launchpad, stretched like an arrow on a crossbow and then shot into the air.",
      "Raybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and can also destroy targets both on the frontline and deep inside Russia.",
      "Among their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.",
      "But after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.",
      "As well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.",
      "Russia says sanctions must be lifted before Ukraine maritime ceasefire can start",
      "However, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.",
      "\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.",
      "Yet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.",
      "It's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons.",
      "They've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.",
      "Russia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.",
      "And Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.",
      "Ukraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.",
      "Kyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.",
      "Zelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.",
      "The energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.",
      "Last month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.",
      "And lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.",
      "Moscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.",
      "At the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.",
      "And if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.",
      "Back at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field.",
      "Oleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

    "story": [
      "On 24 March 2020, India announced its first Covid lockdown, just as the world stood on the brink of a global pandemic that would claim millions of lives.",
      "India's already fragile healthcare system collapsed under the pandemic's weight.",
      "The WHO estimated over 4.7 million Covid deaths in India -  nearly 10 times the official count - but the government rejected the figure, citing flaws in the methodology.",
      "Five years later, BBC India journalists reflect on their experiences recounting how, at times, they became part of the story they were covering.",
      "'Oxygen, oxygen, can you get me oxygen?'",
      "Soutik Biswas, BBC News",
      "It was the summer of 2021.",
      "I woke up to the frantic voice of a school teacher. Her 46-year-old husband had been battling Covid in a Delhi hospital, where oxygen was as scarce as hope.",
      "Here we go again, I thought, dread creeping in. India was trapped in the deadly grip of a lethal second wave of infections, with Delhi at its heart. And it was just another day in a city where breathing itself had become a privilege.",
      "We scrambled for help, making calls, sending SOS messages, hoping someone might have a lead.",
      "Her voice shook as she told us her husband's oxygen levels had dipped to 58. It should have been 92 or higher. He was slipping, but she clung to the small comfort that it had climbed to 62. He was still conscious, still speaking. For now.",
      "But how long could this last? I wondered. How many more lives would be lost because the basics - oxygen, beds, medicine - were beyond reach? This wasn't supposed to happen in 2021. Not here.",
      "The woman called back. The hospital didn't even have an oxygen flow meter, she said. She had to find one herself.",
      "We reached out again. Phones buzzed, tweets flew into the void, hoping someone would see us. Finally, a device was located - a small victory in a sea of despair. The oxygen would flow. For now.",
      "The numbers didn't lie, though.",
      "A report from the same hospital told of a 40-year-old man who died waiting for a bed. He found a stretcher, at least, the report helpfully added. That was where we were now: grateful for a place to lay the dead.",
      "In the face of this, oxygen was a commodity. So were medicines, in short supply and hoarded by those who could pay. People were dying because they couldn't breathe, and the city choked on its own apathy.",
      "This was a war. It felt like a war. And we were losing it.",
      "'Most difficult story I have ever covered'",
      "Yogita Limaye, BBC News",
      "\"Balaji, why are you lying like this,\" screamed a woman outside Delhi's GTB hospital, shaking her unconscious brother who was lying on a stretcher.",
      "Minutes later, her brother, the father of two children, died, waiting outside a hospital before he was even seen by a doctor.",
      "I will never forget her cry.",
      "Around her, families pleaded at the door of the hospital to get a doctor to come and see their loved ones.",
      "They were among hundreds of pleas for help we heard over the weeks we reported on how the second wave of Covid, which began in March 2021, brought a nation to its knees.",
      "It was as though people had been left to tackle a vicious pandemic on their own \u2013  going from hospital to hospital searching for beds and oxygen.",
      "The second wave had not come without warning, but India's government, which had declared victory over the disease two months earlier, was caught unprepared by  the resurgence.",
      "In the ICU of a major hospital, I saw the head doctor pace up and down, making one phone call after another frantically searching for supplies of oxygen.",
      "\"There's just one hour of supply left. Reduce the oxygen we're supplying to our patients to the lowest levels needed to ensure all organs continue to function properly,\" he instructed his deputy, his face tense.",
      "I distinctly remember the heat and fumes from 37 funeral pyres burning simultaneously under the April sun at a Delhi crematorium.",
      "People sat in shock - not yet feeling the grief and anger that would come - seemingly stunned into silence by the frightening speed at which Covid ravaged the capital.",
      "Our work messaging groups buzzed all the time with news of yet another colleague desperately needing a hospital bed for a loved one.",
      "No-one was untouched by it.",
      "In Pune, my father was recovering from a Covid-related heart attack he'd suffered a month earlier.",
      "Back in my hometown Mumbai, one of my closest friends lay critical on a ventilator in hospital.",
      "After five weeks in ICU, miraculously, he recovered. But my father's heart never did, and a year later, he suffered a fatal heart attack, leaving a permanent hole in our lives.",
      "Covid-19 will always be the most difficult story I've ever covered.",
      "'Could I have done more?'",
      "Vikas Pandey, BBC News",
      "Covering the pandemic was the hardest assignment of my life because it's a story that literally came home.",
      "Friends, relatives and neighbours called every day, asking for help procuring oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and even essential medicines. I interviewed several grieving families at that time.",
      "Yet, a few incidents have remained etched in my memory.",
      "In 2021, I reported Altuf Shamsi's story, which sums up the unimaginable pain millions went through.",
      "His pregnant wife and father were both infected with the virus and admitted to different hospitals in Delhi. He knew me through a friend and called to ask if I could help him find another doctor after the hospital where his dad was admitted told him that chances of survival were zero. While he was speaking to me, he got another call from his wife's doctor who said they were running out of oxygen for her.",
      "He lost his father first and later texted me: \"I was looking at his body, while reading SOS messages from Rehab's [his wife] hospital for oxygen.\"",
      "A few days later, he lost his wife too after she gave birth to their daughter.",
      "The two other incidents came closer to home than anything else.",
      "A relative deteriorated very fast after being admitted to a hospital.",
      "He was put on a ventilator and doctors gave a bleak prognosis. One of them advised trying an experimental drug that had shown some results in the UK.",
      "I tweeted and called everybody I thought could help. It's hard to put that frustration into words - he was sinking with each passing hour but the drug that could potentially save him was nowhere to be found.",
      "A kind doctor helped us with one injection but we needed three more. Then someone read my tweet and reached out - she had procured three vials for her father but he died before he could be given the doses. I took her help and my relative survived.",
      "But a cousin did not. He was admitted to the same hospital. His oxygen levels were dipping every hour and he needed to be put on a ventilator, but the hospital didn't have any free.",
      "I made calls the whole night.",
      "The next morning, the hospital ran out of oxygen, leading to many deaths, including his. He left behind his wife and two young children. I still wonder if there was something more I could have done.",
      "'We feared stepping out and we feared staying in'",
      "Geeta Pandey, BBC News",
      "The morning after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a hard lockdown, I headed out to Delhi's main bus station. The only people out on the streets were police and paramilitaries, deployed to ensure people stayed indoors.",
      "The bus station was deserted. A few hundred metres away, I met men, women and children who were looking for ways to reach home, hundreds of miles away. Over the next few days, those numbers swelled into millions as people desperately tried to find a way to be with their families and loved ones.",
      "As the virus made its way over the next few months, and the capital city - along with the rest of the country - remained under a strict shutdown, tragedy lurked at every corner.",
      "We feared stepping out and we feared staying in.",
      "All hopes - including mine - were pinned on a vaccine that scientists across the globe were racing to develop.",
      "I had last visited my mother, bedridden in our ancestral village 450 miles (724km) from Delhi, in January 2020, just a couple of months before the lockdown. My mother, like millions of other people, didn't really understand what Covid was - the disease that had suddenly disrupted their lives.",
      "Every time I called, she had only one question: \"When will you visit?\" The fear that I could carry the virus to her at a time when she was most vulnerable kept me away.",
      "On 16 January 2021, I was at Max hospital in Delhi when India rolled out the world's biggest vaccination drive, promising to vaccinate all the adults in the country of 1.4 billion people. Doctors and medical staff there described it as a \"new dawn\". Some told me they would visit their families as soon as they received their second doses.",
      "I called my mother and told her that I will get my vaccine and visit her soon. But a week later, she was gone.",
      "'I never felt this helpless'",
      "Anagha Pathak, BBC Marathi",
      "A few days after India announced the lockdown, I was travelling to the border of Maharashtra state to document the impact of the restrictions.",
      "It was three in the morning as I drove along the eerily empty Mumbai-Agra highway. My hometown of Nashik looked unrecognisable.",
      "Instead of traffic, migrant workers filled the road, walking back home, stranded and out of work. Among them was a young couple from Uttar Pradesh. They had worked as labourers in Mumbai. The wife, still in her early 20s, was pregnant. They had hoped to catch a ride on a truck, but that didn't happen. By the time they reached Nashik, they had run out of food, water and money.",
      "I will never forget seeing the pregnant woman, her fragile body walking under the scorching sun. I had never felt more helpless. Covid protocols prevented me from offering them a ride. All I could do was give them some water and snacks, while documenting their journey.",
      "A few miles ahead, around 300 people waited for a government bus to take them to the state border. But it was nowhere in sight. After making some calls, two buses finally arrived - still not enough. But I made sure the couple got on the one heading towards Madhya Pradesh state, where they were supposed to catch another bus.",
      "I followed them in my car and waited for some time for them to catch their next bus. It never came.",
      "Eventually, I left. I had an assignment to finish.",
      "Five years have passed, and I still wonder: Did the woman make it home? Did she survive? I don't know her name, but I still remember her weary eyes and fragile body.",

      "Fortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.",
      "Unfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.",
      "LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after Signal chat where US officials discussed air strike plans shared with reporter",
      "LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after Signal chat where US officials discussed air strike plans shared with reporter",
      "The Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "Members of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.",
      "A National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".",
      "Goldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.",
      "\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.",
      "He followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.",
      "These White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.",
      "That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.",
      "And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.",

      "Trump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.",
      "The White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz.",
      "By Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.",

      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"",

    "summary": "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era, writes Orla Guerin.",
    "story": [
      "Beneath the acrid smell of tear gas on the night air in Istanbul, there is a hint of something else - a whiff of panic on the part of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "One of his rivals has been put behind bars - so far, so familiar.",
      "But the jailing of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, suggests President Erdogan is rattled \u2013 and he may have gone too far. The mayor's opposition Republican People's party (CHP), which is summoning vast crowds onto the streets, is certainly hoping so.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - always smartly turned out, even as he prepared to be detained - is the main rival to Turkey's increasingly authoritarian leader. He could well replace him in presidential elections due to be held by 2028 - assuming he is free to contest them.",
      "But this is far more than a row about the fate of Istanbul's mayor - charismatic though he may be.",
      "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era. Many see this as a chance to call halt and stop the descent into all-out autocracy - if it's not already too late.",
      "And they are coming out each night braving the riot police and their tear gas and rubber bullets, the ban on demonstrations, the road and bridge closures, and the risk of detention.",
      "Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu?",
      "Why are thousands of people protesting in Turkey?",
      "More than 1,000 people have been detained so far - in just 5 days - and counting. That's an indication of how easy it is to be arrested here.",
      "Turkey claims to be a functioning democracy - and at face value, it is. There are elections. Voter turnout is usually high - Turks cherish their right to go to the polls and cast their ballots. Voting is largely fair, on the day itself.",
      "The problem is what happens away from the polling stations.",
      "Opposition politicians can be jailed. Critics intimidated. Protesters arrested. The media is largely government controlled. A tweet ridiculing the president could land you in a cell. By the time polling day comes around there's a tsunami of pro-government coverage and the opposition struggles to get a look in.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu is the type of politician who can cut through all this and reach the voters. He's media savvy and has been elected mayor of Istanbul three times. Now he's accused of embezzlement, taking bribes and running a criminal organisation.",
      "If convicted he could be barred from standing in the presidential race. He's already appealing a previous conviction and sentence of two years in prison, for insulting election officials.",
      "Turkey insists that its courts are independent and simply follow the law. Human rights activists here, and independent analysts, scoff at that idea.",
      "The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, said the detention of the mayor, along with about 100 other municipal officials and politicians, is a \"politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities\". In the past it has criticised \"politicised decisions by courts\" in Turkey.",
      "In a post on X, where he has 9.6m followers, Imamoglu said the case against him was \"a black stain on our democracy\", adding: \"I stand tall. I will never bow.\"",
      "That's what Erdogan, 71, may be afraid of - an opponent who is younger, at 53, also appeals to conservative Turkish voters, and is ready for a long fight.",
      "So, what happens now?",
      "The protests could gain momentum and keep spreading. That will present a serious challenge to Erdogan. How long before his heavily armed security forces crack down even harder? How long before someone loses their life at a protest? There is a breaking point for every strongman regime, and it can come with a single bullet.",
      "The opposition intends to keep up the pressure, and the demonstrations.",
      "But after his two decades at the top, Erdogan still has plenty of loyal supporters. He controls virtually all the levers of power and seems determined to hang on. He will be banking on the demonstrations petering out, over time.",
      "The president and his ruling AK party will be hoping the protesters will grow weary and go back to worrying about crushing inflation (39% in February), and the dwindling value of the Turkish lira, rather than free speech, and democracy.",
      "The coming days and weeks will test the staying power of both sides. But if there are lessons to be learned from street protests in other authoritarian nations, a quick breakthrough looks unlikely.",

    "summary": "Alice Guo's star was on the rise in the Philippines - until alleged links to a scam operation led to her downfall.",
    "story": [
      "In early 2022, residents of the rural Philippine town of Bamban, north of Manila, gathered for the mayoral campaign rally of a plucky young woman named Alice Leal Guo.",
      "Supporters dressed in pink \u2013 their candidate's favourite colour \u2013 chattered in anticipation of her arrival.",
      "Then came the low thudding of a helicopter rotor, prompting cheers from the crowd. Sitting in the cockpit, Guo \u2013 in a pink shirt and a pilot's headset \u2013 flashed a smile, waving down at her supporters.",
      "As the helicopter touched down, the crowd broke into a chant: \"A-lice Guo! A-lice Guo!\"",
      "At 31, Guo's star was rising: with promises of generous subsidies and economic development, all delivered in her signature brassy, upbeat tone, she had galvanised a following in the town which would see her become its first female mayor.",
      "But few of those cheering could have predicted that less than three years later, Guo would be behind bars, facing charges of human trafficking and allegations that she was a Chinese spy.",
      "Her downfall began with a police raid that uncovered a compound where a giant scam operation was being run from just behind her office. But as the authorities delved deeper, and Guo struggled to answer basic queries about her past, a perplexing question emerged: who really is Alice Guo?",
      "The mayor everyone seemed to love",
      "Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.",
      "The career change would have required deep pockets \u2013 and when quizzed about her campaign finances much later, Guo said it was friends and acquaintances in the pig-farming business who had supported her mayoral bid.",
      "But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople. Little is known about them, but some have subsequently been convicted of money-laundering, and now also face charges of human trafficking alongside Guo.",
      "Her campaign focused on her sunny persona. On stage at one event, Guo told her audience: \"For our team, rule number one is: Do no harm! No harm is allowed, we should just spread love, love, love!\"",
      "Such cheerful platitudes would carry a taint of irony, in retrospect, when authorities exposed the harm and suffering they alleged had been inflicted under Guo's watch.",
      "But upon taking office in June 2022, she brought the youthful, bright-eyed energy of her campaign into Bamban Municipal Hall, painting it pink and decorating the outside of the building with flowers.",
      "\"Alice was beautiful, she was kind and she was helpful to other women,\" said Priscilla May Aban, 31, who runs a vegetable stall in the town. She told the BBC that she had voted for Guo precisely because she was a woman, adding that as mayor, Guo had arranged cleaning jobs for women of the town.",
      "Guo was widely regarded as a caring and empathetic leader, judging by conversations the BBC had with several residents of Bamban. Miah Mejia, the daughter of one of Alice's political allies, claimed that she had given a free scholarship to every local household. Another interviewee told us he hadn't received a college scholarship but had been given a cash subsidy for his school fees.",
      "An emotional Francisco Flores, 75, said, \"She's helped a lot of poor people here in Bamban, giving medicines and the way she is with people, you'd never see a problem.\"",
      "He proudly mentioned the arrival of a McDonald's and a branch of the Philippine fast-food chain Jollibee during Guo's tenure.",
      "Online, pro-Guo social media accounts portrayed her as a progressive young mayor presiding over a pink-tinted wonderland of parades, buffalo races and concerts.",
      "A year-and-half into her mayoralty, however, this carefully crafted image began to crumble.",
      "Inside Bamban's underbelly",
      "In February 2024, Philippine police received a report about a Vietnamese national who had escaped from the captivity of Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated, a company operating out of a walled compound in Bamban.",
      "On the evening of 12 March, police officers and soldiers gathered nearby to plan a raid on the site, located just a minute's walk from Guo's office in the Municipal Hall.",
      "One officer who was there, Marvin de la Paz of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), told the BBC that around midnight, police informants sent word that people were leaving the compound in buses.",
      "Suspecting that their plans for a raid had been leaked, Mr de la Paz and his colleagues raced straight for the compound. On the way, they saw people fleeing in the other direction, and some officers in the convoy had to peel off and chase them down. When they arrived at the site, they found one of the largest scam hubs ever uncovered in the Philippines, containing 36 buildings and spanning almost 20 acres.",
      "\"We were amazed,\" Mr de la Paz said, \"That was our first time seeing such a grandiose entrance [to a scam compound]... Somehow you feel like you're small in this compound.\"",
      "It later emerged that the compound was built on land which Guo had previously owned \u2013 and that, as mayor, she had granted Zun Yuan a business permit. Her name also appeared on an electricity bill found at the site.",
      "Alice Guo's lawyers did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "Zun Yuan was purportedly an online gambling and entertainment company, which held a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) licence \u2013 accreditation that previously allowed such entities to operate legally in the Philippines.",
      "A relaxation in gambling regulations under ex-President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 led to a surge of Pogo-driven business activity. But many scam syndicates also found Pogo licences useful for masking their criminal operations \u2013 and PAOCC told the BBC they found evidence that Zun Yuan was running \"pig-butchering\" scams from its office in the compound.",
      "Pig-butchering is a con where scammers take time to build trust with victims by posing as lovers or prospective business partners, then trick them into investing their money into fraudulent schemes.",
      "When shown around the compound by PAOCC officers earlier this month, the BBC found, in a deserted employee dormitory, training scripts on how to scam targets.",
      "\"I want to create my own financial empire,\" a scripted character \u2013 a female crypto expert at an international bank - says to her target, before flattering him and encouraging him to share his dreams. She is told to put her target on hold while pretending to \"cash in on a trade\" - only to declare, moments later, that she had made a killing. She then asks whether he himself knows how to trade, setting him up for the transfer of money that would soon follow.",
      "This is just one of the many ways in which these compounds swindle billions  of dollars around the world. Typically run by Chinese organised crime groups across South East Asia, they are staffed by a mixture of willing employees and trafficked victims who are forced to scam.",
      "According to de la Paz, he and his colleagues found more than 300 foreign nationals in the Bamban compound, many of them working there against their will.",
      "Punishments for disobedient or underperforming workers ranged from beatings to the banal: the BBC was shown a notebook from the compound, in which a worker had copied out  the phrase, \"I will meet my targets tomorrow\", hundreds of times in Chinese.",
      "Enclosed by walls topped with barbed wire, the workers' area of the compound was its own self-contained world, featuring a basketball court, supermarket and restaurants. Employees lived in rooms of six, each with a balcony equipped with a toilet and shower.",
      "Their bosses meanwhile lived in a separate gated enclave, says de la Paz, who showed the BBC one of the villas there.",
      "A marble-clad living room featured a high-end entertainment system, security monitor and ornate hardwood furniture. Behind the house was a swimming pool, beside which was a staircase that led down into what were supposedly escape tunnels, now flooded with water.",
      "By the time security forces stormed the Bamban compound on the evening of 12 March 2024, some of these scam bosses had already eluded capture.",
      "But the raid signalled a shift in the political climate.",
      "In June 2022, just as Guo was being sworn in as mayor, Rodrigo Duterte's presidential term had ended.",
      "His successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, soon began facing calls for a ban on Pogo businesses. Many across Philippine society sounded the alarm about the criminality that often lurked within, despite the millions they brought in as revenue. Their biggest customers were rich Chinese, which led to concerns about foreign influence as Marcos, unlike his predecessor, courted Washington over Beijing.",
      "When the raid in Bamban happened, it exposed a dark underbelly of the Philippines \u2013 and the two worlds of Alice Guo   \u2013 the pink office from where she had sought a political career and the scam compound, which suggested far murkier ambitions      \u2013 collapsed in on one another.",
      "'Amnesia girl'",
      "Guo had been a relatively unknown name in the Philippines until last May when she was called to appear before the Senate to explain her links to the scam compound.",
      "Almost overnight, she became a meme. When she told senators she had grown up on a family farm, it brought swift ridicule from Filipinos who said she was too glamorous for the countryside. She became notorious for her inconsistent, vague comments, as well as her claims to have forgotten basic details of her early life, leading social media to nickname her \"my amnesia girl\".",
      "Guo said she'd had a secluded childhood as the child of a Chinese father and Filipino mother \u2013 but could not remember where in the Philippines her family home had been.",
      "At one point, a senator said to her: \"Please mayor, a little more candour than you have shown so far in answering some of the important questions.\"",
      "She told sceptical senators that she had sold her stake in the land before becoming mayor, and that the issuance of a business permit to Zun Yuan had been a mere administrative measure.",
      "Suspicion mounted when, during the hearings, a court in Singapore convicted two of Guo's Chinese former business partners in the Philippines of money-laundering.",
      "Then, last July, despite the intense public interest in her case, Guo managed to slip through the travel restrictions imposed on her and escape to Indonesia. A few months later, she was re-arrested and returned to the Philippines.",
      "It was also in July that Philippine investigators made a breakthrough. Guo's fingerprints were found to match those on file for a girl from China named Guo Hua Ping, who had arrived in the Philippines alongside her mother, also Chinese, in the early 2000s.",
      "This revelation sparked another line of inquiry in the Senate: the idea that Guo might be a spy, exercising influence or gathering intelligence for the Chinese state. The idea spread quickly among the watching public, dominating public discussion of the case.",
      "Jaye Bekema - a senior officer on the staff of Risa Hontiveros, one of the senators who probed potential links between scam syndicates and Chinese intelligence - says the possibility that Guo was a spy warranted an investigation.",
      "\"I think there should be some clarity as to what a spy means,\" Ms Bekema said, while stressing that there is no conclusive proof of Guo being a spy.",
      "\"I am more likely to believe that she didn't plan to be a spy, but that she was tapped to be one [by the Chinese government] because of her criminal connections and her influence on local politics and the local government.\"",
      "In many ways, Guo had become a victim of her own success. The career she chose and the limelight she worked hard to attract meant that she was fully exposed to public scrutiny when China-Philippines relations soured under Marcos.",
      "As political rhetoric escalated and tensions between the two countries spiralled, not least of all in the South China Sea, the young mayor found herself in the crosshairs of espionage accusations.",
      "Others, however, are more sceptical of the allegation. The Chinese state and Guo would have made strange bedfellows, according to Teresita Ang See, a civic leader in the Chinese-Filipino community.",
      "\"What can she spy on in a place like [Bamban]? It's in central Luzon, it's not near any of the sensitive establishments. Why use her? She's very visible, she flaunts her lifestyle. The last person you would use as a spy would be a person like Alice Guo,\" says Ang See.",
      "The Pogo problem",
      "But those who led the questioning against Guo, such as Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, say that it's more complicated than that.",
      "\"Transnational criminals working around the region know how to tap into... I'll call it local talent to penetrate our society, whether through politics or business,\" he explains.",
      "Either way, Guo's case shed light on the Philippine state's vulnerability to being corrupted and co-opted by criminal groups abusing Pogo licences.",
      "In mid-2024, President Marcos declared a blanket ban on all Pogos, citing their widespread abuse by organised crime.",
      "Gatchalian says that the investigation into Alice Guo helped drive this change.",
      "\"Because of it, there was a groundswell of people really clamouring for a ban,\" he tells the BBC. \"And that's when the president officially banned Pogos.\"",
      "Since then, Philippine police have raided scores of scam hubs across the country. But given how influential the syndicates have become, there are concerns that leaks within the security forces and government institutions are allowing criminals to evade capture, according to Mr de la Paz.",
      "Ms Bekema says she feels certain that some candidates in the upcoming national elections are still being financed with Pogo money, while Ang See says that serving police officers have been found working for the criminal syndicates.",
      "In Bamban, concerns about state infiltration seem far from people's minds.",
      "The streets are decked with brightly-coloured campaign posters for the upcoming municipal elections. The Municipal Hall has been whitewashed, and the flowers have been removed.",
      "Guo is currently on trial in six separate cases, potentially facing decades in prison, and has been barred from running for public office again. She has pleaded not guilty to human trafficking charges.",
      "Yet many still treasure the memory of their embattled ex-mayor.",
      "One of those currently standing for Bamban councillor is Miah Mejia's father, Fortunato, a garrulous 69-year-old, who also ran in 2022 as a member of Alice's party, although he lost. He even featured in one of her publicity videos at the time.",
      "He says that the people of Bamban had taken a chance by electing Guo, but that she had good connections to Chinese investors and had delivered on all her promises to the townspeople.",
      "He is also indifferent to the Senate's evidence that Guo was not a Filipino.",
      "\"That's what they've been showing, but we still don't believe it because we don't care whether she's Filipino or not,\" he says. \"What's important is whether or not she helps us.\"",
      "Mr Mejia is adamant that the Alice Guo he knew would not have been involved in human trafficking.",
      "\"Never, ever would she do something like that,\" he says, flatly. \"I know she has a heart. She fears the Lord.\"",

      "The new school year began on Saturday in Afghanistan but for the fourth consecutive year, girls over 12 were barred from attending classes.",
      "\"All my dreams were shattered,\" she says, her voice fragile and filled with emotion.",
      "Amina, now 15, has always wanted to become a doctor. As a little girl, she suffered from a heart defect and underwent surgery. The surgeon who saved her life was a woman \u2013 an image that stayed with her and inspired her to take her studies seriously.",
      "But in 2021, when the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan, Amina's dream was abruptly put on hold.",
      "\"When my dad told me the schools were closed, I was really sad. It was a very bad feeling,\" she says quietly. \"I wanted to get an education so that I could become a doctor.\"",
      "The restrictions on education for teenage girls, imposed by the Taliban, has affected more than one million girls, according to Unicef, the UN's children's agency.",
      "Now, madrassas \u2013 religious centres focused on Islamic teachings \u2013 have become the only way for many women and teenage girls to access education. However, those whose families can afford private tuition may still have access to subjects including maths, science and languages.",
      "While the madrassas are seen by some as a way to offer young women access to some of the education they would have had in mainstream schools, others say they are no substitute and there are concerns of brainwashing.",
      "I meet Amina in the dimly-lit basement of Al-Hadith madrassa in Kabul, a newly established private religious educational centre for around 280 female students of various ages.",
      "The basement is cold, with cardboard walls and a sharp chill in the air. After chatting for about 10 minutes, our toes are already going numb.",
      "Al-Hadith madrassa was founded a year ago by Amina's brother, Hamid, who felt compelled to act after seeing the toll that the education ban had taken on her.",
      "\"When girls were denied education, my sister's dream of becoming a heart surgeon was crushed, significantly affecting her wellbeing\", says Hamid, who is in his early thirties.",
      "\"Having the chance to go back to school, as well as learning midwifery and first aid, made her feel much better about her future,\" he adds.",
      "Afghanistan remains the only country where women and girls are banned from secondary and higher education.",
      "The Taliban government originally suggested the prohibition would be temporary, pending the fulfilment of certain conditions, such as an \"Islamic\" curriculum. However, there has been no progress towards reopening schools for older girls in the years since.",
      "In January 2025, a report by the Afghanistan Centre for Human Rights suggested that madrassas are being used to further the Taliban's ideological goals.",
      "The report alleges that \"extremist content\" has been integrated into their curriculum.",
      "It says that textbooks advocated by the Taliban promote its political and military activities, and prohibited the mixing of men and women, as well as endorsing the enforced wearing of the hijab.",
      "The Afghan Centre for Human Rights calls the ban on older girls attending school a \"systematic and targeted violation\" of their right to quality education.",
      "Before the Taliban return, the number of registered madrassas is believed to have been around 5,000. They focus on religious education, which includes Quranic, Hadith, Sharia law, and Arabic language studies.",
      "But since the restrictions on girls' education were introduced some have expanded the teaching of subjects including chemistry, physics, mathematics, and geography, and languages like Dari, Pashto, and English.",
      "Though a few madrassas tried to introduce midwifery and first aid training, the Taliban banned medical training for women in December last year.",
      "Hamid said he was dedicated to providing an education which blends both religious and other academic subjects for secondary school-age girls.",
      "\"Socialising with others girls again made my sister much happier,\" he told me with a smile, clearly proud of his sister's resilience.",
      "We visit another independently-run madrassa in Kabul.",
      "The Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa educates more than 1,800 girls and women from the ages of five to 45. Classes are organised by student ability rather than age. We were able to visit under strict supervision.",
      "Like Al-Hadath madrassa, it is freezing cold. The three-storey building has no heating, and some classrooms were missing doors and windows.",
      "In one large room, two Quran classes and a sewing class are taking place simultaneously, as a group of girls wearing hijabs and black face masks sit cross-legged on the carpet.",
      "The only heat source in the school is a small electric radiator in the second-floor office of the director, Mohammad Ibrahim Barakzai.",
      "Mr Barakzai tells me that academic subjects are taught alongside religious ones.",
      "But when I ask for evidence of that, staff search for a while before bringing out a few tattered maths and science textbooks.",
      "Meanwhile, the classrooms are well stocked with religious texts.",
      "This madrassa is divided into two sections: formal and informal.",
      "The formal section covers subjects like languages, history, science, and Islamic studies. The informal section covers Quranic studies, Hadith, Islamic law, and practical skills like tailoring.",
      "Notably, graduates from the informal section outnumber those from the formal section by 10 to one.",
      "Hadiya, who is 20 years old, recently graduated from the madrassa after studying a broad range of subjects including maths, physics, chemistry, and geography.",

      "Hadiya now teaches the Quran at the madrassa, as she tells me there was not enough demand for her favourite subjects.",
      "Safia, also 20, teaches the Pashto language at Al-Hadith madrassa. She passionately believes that girls in religious centres should enhance what she described as their personal development.",
      "She focuses on Fiqh, the Islamic legal framework essential for daily Muslim practices.",
      "\"Fiqh is not included in mainstream schools or universities. As a Muslim woman, studying Fiqh is vital for women's betterment,\" she says.",
      "\"Understanding concepts such as ghusl \u2013 ablution \u2013 the distinctions in prostration between genders, and the prerequisites for prayer are crucial.\"",
      "However, she adds that madrassas \"cannot serve as a substitute for mainstream schools and universities\".",

      "In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.",
      "The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.",

    "title": "What makes a rum Jamaican? Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",
      "Gyllenhaal added, \"I feel tremendous gratitude. And he makes me feel it when I walk in that rehearsal room every day.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",

      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",

      "Colton Belluzzo   also loves to fish, ride horses and even give his own weather reports on camera.",
      "But when he was 7 months old, Colton Belluzzo  was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy \u2014 a rare condition that affects 1 in 5,000 children, mostly boys. It weakens muscles over time, and most people with DMD don't live past the age of 30.",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "summary": "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law this week that bans some artificial dyes as well as two preservatives from foods sold statewide.",
    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",

      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",

      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:39:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting Thursday, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting Thursday, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations.

      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",

Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner.

      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen.

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",

      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",

      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",
      "\"If the public conversation turns from spending cuts to tax cut happy talk, consumer sentiment could rebound. But in the meantime, the economy is likely to slow and underperform its growth in 2023 and 2024,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:46:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",

    "story": [
      "23andMe, a formerly high-flying genetic testing company, announced Sunday that it was declaring bankruptcy and that it would seek a buyer.",
      "The company also said CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki is resigning immediately and will be replaced by Chief Financial and Accounting Officer Joe Selsavage as interim chief executive.",
      "23andMe moved in November to slash 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan, a step that came roughly two months after its entire board resigned.",
      "\"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities,\" 23andMe Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement. \"We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients.\"",
      "23andMe offers two basic kinds of services \u2014 consumer and therapeutics. The former provides people with information on their ancestry and genetic health profile, including the risk of passing on certain conditions to their children, according to S&P Capital IQ. The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",

      "She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\"",
      "In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.",
      "When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"",

      "Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",

      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.",
      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",

The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",

      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling.

The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",

      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in the challenge brought by unions who argued DOGE's access was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "summary": "Federal health officials said they are cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-19-related funds for state and local public health departments.",
    "story": [
      "Federal health officials said they are cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-19-related funds for state and local public health departments \u2014 money that was was largely used for COVID-19 testing, virus research and community health jobs.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The statement said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0expects to recover the money beginning 30 days after termination notices, which began being sent out on Monday. The move was first reported by NBC News.",
      "\"This is just one in a series of many, many cuts we're seeing across health agencies across the country,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on CBS News 24/7 on Wednesday.",
      "\"This ... is money that had been going to state, local, territorial, tribal health departments across the country, and as we know, as was the case with a lot of COVID funding, it was not just supporting COVID-related programs, but many other things,\" she said, noting wastewater surveillance\u00a0as one example of what's being lost with these cuts, which helps experts look for infectious diseases and other toxins in the water.",
      "\"This has direct applications to the measles outbreak in West Texas right now. It gives us an early warning system for where there might be measles in other areas, where they need to be focusing measles vaccinations, and that program is falling victim to this,\" Gounder said. \"And state (and) local health departments really depend on that CDC money. The CDC functions as a funnel of funding to the state and local level, and in some cases, it's 90% of their budget.\"",
      "Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said much of the funding was set to end soon anyway. \"It's ending in the next six months,\" she said. \"There's no reason \u2014 why rescind it now? It's just cruel and unusual behavior.\"",
      "Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement, \"We learned yesterday that the federal government has unilaterally terminated approximately $226 million in grants to Minnesota Department of Health related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts. This action was sudden and unexpected.\"",
      "She added, \"It will take time to figure out all of the impacts of this action, but these cuts are a tremendous loss \u2014 made worse by the uncertainty and chaos that our federal partners have introduced into this process.\"",
      "In a related move, more than two dozen COVID-related research grants funded by the National Institutes of Health have been canceled. Earlier this month, the Trump administration shut down ordering from covidtest.gov, the site where Americans could have COVID-19 tests delivered to their mailboxes for no charge.",
      "Although the COVID federal public health emergency has ended, the virus is still killing Americans: 458 people per week on average have died from COVID over the past four weeks,\u00a0according to CDC data.",
      "HHS wouldn't provide many details about how the federal government expects to recover the money from what it called \"impacted recipients.\" But HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an email: \"The $11.4 billion is undisbursed funds remaining.\"",
      "Freeman said her understanding is that state health departments already had the COVID money.",
      "\"The funding was authorized by Congress, was appropriated by Congress, and it was out the door, basically, into the hands of the grantees\" \u2014 states, she said, which decide how to distribute it locally.",
      "Under both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, billions of dollars was allocated for COVID response through legislation, including a COVID relief bill and the American Rescue Plan Act.",

    "summary": "As Trump Cabinet members sent texts on Signal, one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia, but the White House says he didn't have his phone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",

      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",
      "In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has \"no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that the panel is seeking an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol after the most recent release, Wicker detailed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Steven Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:14:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The Department of Education's civil rights office says it launched a Title IX probe in Portland, Oregon, after a trans student-athlete won races at a girls' track meet.",
    "story": [
      "Public school administrators in Portland, Oregon, are facing a federal civil rights probe over a transgender student-athlete's alleged participation in a girls' track and field meet last week, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday.",
      "The department's Office of Civil Rights has opened an investigation into Portland's school district and the Oregon School Activities Association, a nonprofit that oversees high school sports statewide. Federal officials accused both the school district and the nonprofit of violating Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination and is used at times to challenge trans women and girls who compete on women's and girls' teams.",
      "In this case, the civil rights office has alleged that Portland Public Schools and the activities association  allowed a trans runner to compete in the girls' division of a March 19 interscholastic track and field competition, potentially undercutting Title IX as the runner took first place in two races. The office also said allowing the trans student to use the girls' locker room during the event may violate the statute.",
      "The civil rights office said it sent letters to Kimberly Armstrong, the superintendent of Portland Public Schools, and the activities association, which is the governing body for the Portland Interscholastic League, to inform them of the probe. The office is specifically looking into the activities association's \"gender identity participation\" policy to determine whether it could violate the terms of Title IX.",
      "That policy, according to the activities association, aims to give students opportunities to participate in athletic programs that align with their gender identities, while also upholding safe and fair standards for all students. Developed with the Oregon Department of Education, the activities association  says its policy \"promotes harmony and fair competition among member schools by maintaining equality of eligibility\" and gives more students a chance to participate in interscholastic activities.",
      "The federal civil rights office said it launched the investigation after receiving a complaint that blamed the school district and the activities association  for allegedly allowing an athlete not assigned female at birth \"to compete in the girls' track and field division over the last two seasons.\" The complaint noted the trans runner had won two races \u2014 the girls' 200-meter and 400-meter \u2014 at an interscholastic championship meet in Portland last year and again this year.",
      "\"We will not allow the Portland Public Schools District or any other educational entity that receives federal funds to trample on the antidiscrimination protections that women and girls are guaranteed under law,\" Craig Trainor, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. \"OCR will use every lawful means to ensure that no female athlete is denied equal athletic opportunities or robbed of her rightful accolades.\"",
      "President Trump's return to office in January, and subsequent executive order declaring that \"only two sexes\" will be recognized by the federal government, set the stage for these kinds of investigations to move forward. Standing against the ability of trans athletes to compete in girls' or women's sports was a substantial part of his election campaign, as it had already become a political flashpoint for a number of Republican leaders.",
      "A spokesperson for the activities association told CBS News Wednesday that the organization had just learned about the federal investigation and was consulting its legal counsel to respond to the Department of Education. Armstrong, from the Portland school district, acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the federal civil rights office did receive a complaint, sparking the probe. She said Portland Public Schools \"is fully cooperating with the investigation.\"",
      "\"I stand firm in our legal responsibilities, and I deeply value every student's right to be treated with dignity, safety, and respect,\" her statement continued. Citing \"this complex legal landscape,\" Armstrong added that the district's policies comply with Oregon state laws, \"which may differ from federal guidance.\"",
      "\"While I am limited in what I can share at this time due to the sensitive nature of the matter and our duty to protect student privacy, I want to be clear: my commitment\u2014and our district's commitment\u2014to doing what's right for all students, especially those most vulnerable, remains unwavering,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A federal district court ordered the Department of Education to restore access to grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to intervene in an ongoing dispute over Department of Education grants that were canceled because they funded programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "In a filing with the high court, the Justice Department requested the justices put on hold a temporary order from a lower court requiring the Education Department to restore millions of dollars in grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide relief to the Justice Department and agreed with the district court that the terminations of the grants likely violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "Echoing concerns raised in other emergency appeals filed with the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris took aim at the scope of the lower court's order. The Trump administration has in recent days focused its attacks on nationwide injunctions. More than a dozen have been issued by district courts considering legal challenges to President Trump's policies.",
      "\"This court should put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions,\" she wrote.",
      "The Justice Department has also asked the Supreme Court to step into court fights over Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship and efforts to fire thousands of federal probationary employees. The high court has yet to act on their bids for emergency relief.",
      "The grant programs at issue in the case, the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, or TQP and SEED, relate to efforts to improve the development and quality of teachers. In early February, the acting education secretary ordered a review of all grant awards to ensure that they did not fund so-called DEI practices, which the Trump administration have said are discriminatory. The review found that 104 grants should be terminated because they conflicted with the department's policy objectives.",
      "Roughly one month after the grants were canceled, the eight states filed a lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order from a federal district judge in Massachusetts. Public and private universities, as well as nonprofit groups, in their states received the TQP and SEED grants from the federal government.",
      "The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 argued that the grant cancellations violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the agency rulemaking process, in part because the Department of Education failed to \"provide a transparent and reasonable explanation for the termination of the grants.\"",
      "The district court in Massachusetts issued a temporary restraining order, initially set to remain in place for 14 days, that ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the grants for all recipients in the states. It also temporarily blocked the Education Department from canceling any further grants for beneficiaries in the challenger states.",
      "While the administration began working to reinstate access to the funds, it asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the lower court's order and allow it to continue with the grant cancellations.",
      "But the 1st Circuit rejected the Department of Education's request. The district court later extended its temporary order to remain in place up to April 7 while it considered a bid for longer-term relief.",
      "The case from Massachusetts is not the only challenge to the Education Department's decision to scrap DEI-related grants. In a second dispute filed in Maryland, a federal district court separately ordered the administration to reinstate canceled TQP and SEED grants for members of teacher-education groups.",
      "In its bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration warned that the two orders from courts in Maryland and Massachusetts potentially overlap. The government reiterated its opposition to the broad injunctions that have been issued by district courts in the slew of cases.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the Executive Branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the Executive Branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" Harris wrote.",
      "She argued that the temporary restraining order gives relief to all grant recipients in the states, instead of limiting it to the states or their instrumentalities. The district court, Harris wrote, directed a federal agency and its leaders to immediately make available millions of dollars to fund programs that they determined do not align with the administration's objectives.",
      "\"That is a remarkable intrusion on the operations of the Executive Branch, and the kind of judicial action that this court has routinely decided to review,\" she said.",
      "On the merits of the case, the acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, said the Massachusetts court did not have jurisdiction to consider the states' claims, since the case is effectively a contract dispute that should be heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",

      "Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in group chat, posted on social media that Goldberg \"oversold what he had,\" and said the classified information that Goldberg claimed CIA director John Ratcliffe shared was \"the name of his chief of staff.\"",

      "The Atlantic said it asked Trump administration officials and the White House if they objected to publishing the messages in light of their denials that the messages contained classified information or \"war plans.\" Most did not respond, and Leavitt told The Atlantic the administration objected to the release, while insisting there was \"no classified information transmitted in the group chat.\"",

      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, has questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese decent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",
      "Jennifer Jacobs, \n                                                  \n                                  Scott MacFarlane and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:54:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court was considering a challenge to a 2022 regulation that sought to regulate ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, delivering a win for federal efforts to curb gun violence.",
      "The high court ruled 7-2 in finding that the rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is not facially inconsistent with federal firearms law. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the opinion for the majority.",
      "\"The GCA embraces, and thus permits ATF to regulate, some weapon parts kits and unfinished frames or receivers, including those we have discussed,\" Gorsuch wrote, referencing the Gun Control Act of 1968.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court did not involve the Second Amendment, but whether ATF went too far when it issued the rule subjecting ghost guns to the same requirements as commercial firearms.",
      "It follows a decision from the high court last year that struck down a measure from the first Trump administration that outlawed bump stocks, which are devices that increase a firearm's rate of fire. It's unclear whether President Trump will keep the regulation in place or take steps to rescind it.",
      "Gorsuch's opinion included images of a \"Buy Build Shoot\" weapon parts kit from Polymer80, a seller of the kits, and a completed firearm constructed from the parts. He called the finished product \"an instrument of combat.\"",
      "\"No one would confuse the semiautomatic pistol pictured above with a tool or a toy,\" he wrote. \"Of course, as sold, the kit requires some assembly. But a number of considerations persuade us that, even as sold, the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit qualifies as a 'weapon.'\"",
      "Gorsuch acknowledged that while it may take roughly 30 minutes to construct a firearm out of the kit, it \"comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious.\"",
      "\"Really, the kit's name says it all: 'Buy Build Shoot,'\" he wrote.",
      "Writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of rewriting the law to regulate weapon parts kits and said it \"blesses the government's overreach based on a series of errors.\"",
      "\"Congress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not,\" he said. \"I would adhere to the words Congress enacted.\"",
      "Gun violence prevention groups cheered the Supreme Court's decision, calling it a victory for public safety.",
      "\"Ghost guns are the gun industry's way of skirting commonsense gun laws and arming dangerous people without background checks. We are thrilled that the Supreme Court has upheld the ATF rule that treats ghost guns as what they are: guns,\" said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel, Giffords Law Center, in a statement.",
      "The court was considering an appeal from the Biden administration of a lower court ruling that struck down the measure.",
      "The regulation, issued in 2022, sought to address a surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, which can be made with 3D printers or kits and parts available online. The weapons don't have serial numbers or transfer records, making them difficult for law enforcement to trace and attractive to people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms.",
      "The rule clarified the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to include a weapon parts kit that can be assembled into an operational weapon in less than 30 minutes, and the incomplete frame of a handgun or receiver of a rifle.",
      "By seeking to regulate the kits under the decades-old law, the rule subjects ghost gun manufacturers and sellers to the same requirements as commercial gun makers, meaning they have to be licensed, mark their products with serial numbers, maintain certain records and run background checks on interested buyers.",
      "Shortly before the regulation took effect, gun owners, advocacy groups and the makers of parts kits challenged it in federal court, arguing that ATF didn't have the authority to change the definition of \"firearm\" to cover weapon parts kits.",
      "A federal district court judge and a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit struck down the rule. The appeals court found that Congress did not authorize ATF to regulate kits under the Gun Control Act.",
      "The Biden administration had warned the Supreme Court that if it were to strike down the rule, then minors, criminals and others who cannot have guns could instead buy kits that could be assembled into a functioning, untraceable firearm in a matter of minutes.",
      "The Justice Department said the measure has been successful at addressing the surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, and the market for the weapons has effectively collapsed in the nearly two years the rule has been in place.",
      "A group of major U.S. cities also said the regulation has been effective at reducing the use of ghost guns in their municipalities. In New York, ghost gun recoveries fell in 2023 for the first time in four years, and in Baltimore, they decreased in 2023 for the first time since 2019.",
      "During an earlier stage in the litigation over the Biden administration's rule, the Supreme Court allowed ATF to enforce the requirements until it issued a decision.",
      "The court's majority said that there are limits to its decision, and that while some parts kits qualify as weapons that can be regulated, not all do.",
      "\"Weapon parts kits vary widely. Not all come as complete as the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit. Some, too, may require more time, expertise, or specialized tools to finish,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"And at some point a kit may be so incomplete or cumbersome to assemble that it can no longer fairly be described as a 'weapon,'\" capable of being converted into a working firearm.",
      "He continued: \"While we recognize the problem, this case does not require us to untangle exactly how far\" the law reaches.",

    "summary": "Trump has signed an executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandating that all ballots be received by Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",
      "While Congress has the power to regulate voting \u2014 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" for elections.",
      "Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an \"unlawful\" weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is \"trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\" And Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order \"is not just misguided \u2014 it is immoral and illegal.\"",
      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",
      "Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a \"welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.\"",
      "At least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post, \"This will not stand. We will sue.\"",
      "The president has long claimed elections were being rigged, even before the results were known. He's battled certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, falsely blaming\u00a0widespread fraud for his loss.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act, the Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday.",
      "\"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\" the nonpartisan budget office said Wednesday.",
      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",
      "The CBO analysis noted that if the government's borrowing needs are \"significantly greater\" than projections, the Treasury Department's resources could be exhausted as early as late May or June.",
      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue. Last month, the House included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion in its budget proposal, which serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. But the Senate has been pursuing a different budget measure that does not include a debt limit increase.",
      "In recent days, Republicans in Congress have been working to reconcile the two approaches as they look to make headway on the complicated process to implement the president's agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met Tuesday afternoon with top tax leaders as they work to unite behind a plan on the path forward. And Thune told reporters he's hopeful lawmakers will be able to address the debt limit as part of the budget process.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continues to insist it didn't defy a federal judge's order when it failed to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order blocking the deportations of alleged gang members who hadn't been afforded due process. It's a case that's become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and federal courts.",
      "In a 14-page document\u00a0filed late Tuesday night, the Justice Department spelled out before Boasberg why it didn't turn around the two flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members despite his verbal order to do so.",
      "\"These removals both complied with the law and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. The Government will continue to defend the removals before this Court and, if necessary, on appeal challenging this Court's two injunctions issued on March 15,\" the filing reads. It's signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior DOJ officials.",
      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",

    "summary": "President Trump told reporters he does not believe national security adviser Mike Waltz should apologize for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal group chat.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday defended national security adviser Mike Waltz as his administration faces questions about its use of the encrypted messaging app Signal after a reporter was mistakenly added to a group chat detailing highly sensitive plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the information that was discussed on the 18-member group chat, which included high-ranking officials like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was not classified and said Waltz is a \"very good man\" who will \"continue to do a good job.\"",
      "\"I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best,\" the president said of Waltz. \"It's equipment and technology that's not perfect and probably he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night, Waltz called the situation \"embarrassing\" and said he takes \"full responsibility,\" adding that he \"built\" the Signal chat group.",
      "However, he claimed that he did not have Goldberg's contact information on his phone and is unsure how Goldberg's number got there, or how Goldberg got into the chat.",
      "\"I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,\" Waltz said. \"And we're going to figure out how this happened.\"",
      "Waltz also said that a staffer did not put Goldberg's contact information into the phone.",
      "The Trump administration's use of the app to detail the plans to bomb Houthi targets on March 15 was revealed Monday by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who wrote in a piece that he was added to a chat on Signal by an account that shared Waltz's name earlier this month.",
      "Several days later, an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out plans for strikes in Yemen, which included information about \"weapons packages, targets and timing\" shortly before the attack took place, Goldberg wrote.",
      "Among those included in the chat were accounts that appeared to belong to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg's account. Witkoff was in Moscow when he was added to the group chat, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting found.",
      "Hegseth denied any war plans were discussed, but the National Security Council said in a statement to CBS News on Monday that the message thread detailed by Goldberg \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The breach sparked immediate condemnation of the Trump administration from congressional Democrats and raised questions about the use of Signal on government or personal devices, as well as whether top U.S. officials were sharing classified information.",
      "In a letter sent to Mr. Trump Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \"Hegseth should be fired immediately.\"",
      "\"The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans\u2014including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used\u2014during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,\" Jeffries wrote. \"His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters that he believes his administration will limit its use of Signal in the future, though he acknowledged that \"a lot of people\" across the federal government rely on the app.",
      "\"I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again,\" he said. \"We may be forced to use it. We may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety and may be forced to use it. Generally speaking, I think we won't be using it very much.\"",
      "The president questioned whether the app has vulnerabilities that allow other users to hack into conversations.",
      "\"I think Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Waltz said technical experts and legal teams will look into the issue.",
      "\"Of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,\" he said. \"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger.\"",
      "Waltz later attacked Goldberg and claimed he and other reporters in Washington, D.C., have \"made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.\"",
      "\"This one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we're looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" he said.",
      "Waltz told the president that Goldberg is attempting to deflect attention away from the \"freedom that you're enabling,\" and said \"the world owes President Trump a favor.\"",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard both appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Tuesday and faced questions from senators about the controversy. The two denied classified information was exchanged in the group chat, but Ratcliffe confirmed he was a participant in the thread.",
      "Ratcliffe added that Signal was on his agency computer when he took the helm of the CIA earlier this year and said it's \"permissible\" to use it to communicate and coordinate \"for work purposes.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration (SSA), Frank Bisignano, vowed to crack down on fraud and to protect Americans' personal data in a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",
      "Bisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",

      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",

      "Washington \u2014 Democrats grilled the leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies Tuesday over a security breach in which top Trump officials inadvertently included a journalist in a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about global threats facing the U.S. However the annual hearing, which typically focuses on threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, largely concentrated on the lapse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The National Security Council said Monday in a statement to CBS News that the message thread \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now\": Democrats grill on group chat",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe both denied that classified information was shared in the group chat in a feisty exchange with Warner. Confronted by Warner, Gabbard initially declined to say whether she was part of the chat.",
      "\"Because it's all classified?\" Warner said.",
      "\"Because this is currently under review,\" Gabbard responded.",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now,\" Warner said.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year.",
      "\"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year. \"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "\"It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,\" Ratcliffe said. \"My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "Ratcliffe later told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommended that \"high-level officials who would be targeted by foreign adversaries\" use \"end-to-end encrypted apps whenever possible.\"",
      "The spy chiefs also denied that the conversation included information on weapons packages, targets or timing of the strikes, as Goldberg reported.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ratcliffe said, with Gabbard adding \"same answer.\"",
      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",
      "Gabbard told Wyden she had \"no objection\" to cooperating with an audit to confirm such, while Ratcliffe said he would comply with any follow up that the National Security Council deemed appropriate.",
      "Another heated moment came during the back and forth between Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and Ratcliffe. Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment,\" Bennet said. \"You need to do better.\"",
      "Gabbard acknowledged to Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, that she was overseas during at least part of the group chat discussions, though she declined to say if she was using a work or personal phone for the discussions, citing a review by the National Security Council.",

    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "President Trump's administration appealed after Boasberg blocked those deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Just after midnight Monday, Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg's impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.",

      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been looking for Yunseo Chung, who came to the U.S. with her family from South Korea at the age of 7, since earlier this month, including by visiting her parents' residence and telling her lawyer that there's an administrative warrant for her arrest, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court.",
      "ICE issues so-called administrative warrants against noncitizens accused of immigration violations. They are not signed by judges.",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, who was nominated in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, granted Chung's attorneys a temporary restraining order, preventing her from being arrested or deported.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.",
      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

    "summary": "The Senate Finance Committee voted to advance the nomination of Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee voted on Tuesday to advance the nomination of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former heart surgeon and television host, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The panel voted 14 to 13 along party lines to advance Oz's nomination, which now heads to the full Senate.",
      "Oz appeared before the committee\u00a0earlier this month. If confirmed, the 64-year-old would oversee the nearly $1.5 trillion the federal government spends on Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 health insurance programs that make up a large amount of the budget and have often been wielded as political cudgels.",
      "Oz has widespread name recognition as the host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University. After the show stopped taping in 2022, Oz ran for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "The former television host has touted meetings with key Republican senators on his path to confirmation, some of whom praised him during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. The committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, voiced his support for Oz ahead of the vote Tuesday, saying he has \"years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate.\" Crapo added that the background makes Oz \"uniquely qualified\" for the role, while urging the panel to advance the nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats criticized Oz during the hearing, alleging that he had dodged taxes. The criticism added to earlier critiques among Democrats of his views toward abortion and concerns about conflicts of interests. Oz has pledged to resign from positions he holds at companies, including a drugmaker and supplement company, while divesting from healthcare companies as part of his ethics agreement.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, argued ahead of the vote Tuesday that given the chance to \"assure the American people that he would not be a a rubber stamp for Republican plans to gut Medicaid and hike Affordable Care Act premiums\" during Oz's confirmation hearing, \"at every turn he failed the test.\" Wyden encouraged his colleagues to oppose the nomination, claiming that Oz has shown no ability or interest in \"pushing back on the dangerous Trump healthcare agenda.\"",
      "The vote comes as the Finance Committee voted narrowly to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary in February. Kennedy would serve as Oz's supervisor if he's confirmed.",

    "summary": "Masih Alinejad, a prominent critic of the regime, is a leader of the movement to free Iranian women from the compulsory hijab and has drawn the ire of Iran's Supreme Leader.",
    "story": [
      "Masih Alinejad, a journalist and prominent critic of the Iranian regime, was in the garden of her Brooklyn home when she locked eyes with the hitman hired to assassinate her. It was late July, and she had gone into her garden to pick vegetables.",
      "\"He was gigantic,\" she later testified in federal district court in Manhattan at the trial of the men who plotted to kill her. \"He was in the sunflowers staring into my eyes.\"",
      "Though she eyed him with some suspicion, she also thought he might be taking pictures of her garden of \"beautiful sunflowers.\"",
      "\"Every curse that I hear, I plant a flower,\" she explained, referring to threats she's endured for criticizing the Islamic Republic. \"That's why I have a massive garden. A lot of cursing and threats.\"",
      "The man in her garden, Khalid Mehdiyev, had been directed to kill Alinejad by fellow members of a Russian mob organization known as Thieves-in-Law, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, prosecutors said. In his car was an AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition. Prosecutors said that Iran's government had offered Amirov and Omarov a $500,000 bounty.",
      "On July 28, 2022, this murder-for-hire scheme involving Russian mobsters and the Iranian regime targeting a defiant dissident was foiled in Brooklyn. Alinejad, who has wild curls and often wears a white flower in her hair, is also an activist and leader of the movement to free Iran's women from the compulsory hijab.",
      "This was only one of the Iranian regime's several attempts to assassinate or kidnap Alinejad. One alleged assassination planner targeted not just Alinejad, but also President Trump during his 2024 campaign last fall. Farhad Shakeri is accused of being an \"asset\" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who was tasked with devising a plan to kill Mr. Trump and recruiting two men to \"silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist,\" according to the indictment.",
      "While it was not the first attempt on her life, Amirov and Omarov were the first attempted assassins to go to trial in New York last week in a criminal case that provided a rare look into Iran's assassination attempts on U.S. soil. Prosecutors said high-ranking members of the IRGC were instructing Amirov and Omarov in the scheme. FBI agents detailed their analysis of devices and internet search histories tying Iranian intelligence officers to the plot. Through photographs, videos and messages, they illustrated the global network behind the attempted murder, with Medhiyev reporting his surveillance progress to Omarov and Amirov as he updated them from Brooklyn.",
      "\"We blocked it from both sides, it will be a show once she steps out of the house,\" messaged Medhiyev to Omarov, who then forwarded it to Amirov. \"God willing,\" he replied. In another plan, Medhiyev went to ask Alinejad for flowers from her garden, but she did not come to the door. Her Ring camera surveillance at one point showed him pacing back and forth on her porch before trying to open the door. Medhiyev was later stopped by police, who found the rifle and bullets in the backseat of his car.",
      "Last week, a federal jury found Omarov and Amirov guilty on all charges, including murder-for-hire and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. They face over 50 years in prison.",
      "\"I am being bombarded with emotion,\" Alinejad told CBS News over the phone shortly after the verdict, sounding tearful. \"I just need to cry now, I need to laugh, I need to dance. I just got the news now.\"",
      "\"The real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,\" she said. \"I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished.\"",
      "Despite the attempts on her life, Alinejad said she will not be silenced in her fight against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"She has a mission,\" her husband Kambiz Foroohar told CBS News. \"And that mission is that the Islamic Republic is like ISIS. It's an evil regime. She feels like she's compelled to challenge it. Compulsory hijab is just one way of challenging the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "\"Next: Masih Alinejad\"",
      "In Iran, Alinejad struggled to keep her wild curls hidden under a hijab.",
      "\"I have a lot of hair. It was not easy,\" she testified in court.",
      "She was a political journalist there for over a decade but admitted she was always crossing the \"red lines\" of what Iran's government would allow people to write about. In 2009, she fled Iran.",
      "\"I'm a journalist, so I couldn't just keep quiet,\" she said. \"I had no option but to leave Iran.\"",
      "Once in the United States, she took off her hijab. She posted a photo of herself jumping in the air on social media, reveling in the feeling of the wind in her hair. In Iran, she \"felt like a hostage.\"",
      "That was the beginning of her campaign against the compulsory hijab, which evolved into the White Wednesday movement. Every Wednesday, women in Iran would film videos of themselves walking unveiled, a peaceful protest against compulsion.",
      "\"Social media is like my weapon,\" Alinejad testified. \"My social media expos\u00e9.\"",
      "The Iranian regime reacted by calling her and unveiled women \"prostitutes,\" she said. They arrested hundreds of women.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Court has threatened women with up to 10 years in prison for sharing protest videos with her. \"It's become a crime,\" she said, her voice cracking.",
      "The government has also accused Alinejad of being a foreign agent. \"Oh, all of them,\" she testified listing intelligence agencies: \"Agent of the CIA, agent of Mossad, Agent of MI6, agent of President Trump.\"",
      "In court, Alinejad broke down when the prosecution displayed a cartoon published in Iran's state-controlled newspaper depicting two dissidents hanging in the air and an image of Alinejad looking up at them fearfully. Both men, who held citizenship in Europe (one also had a U.S. green card) were kidnapped and executed by the Iranian regime. She testified in court that the caption read: \"Next: Masih Alinejad.\"",
      "\"Did you understand that to be about you?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied tearfully.",
      "By proxy, Alinejad's family in Iran has also become a target. In 2018, Iranian government officials tried to coerce relatives to lure her to Turkey, where they planned to capture her, offering a payment in exchange. The relatives did not accept.",
      "In 2019, her brother was arrested on charges of associating with her. He was sentenced to eight years in prison but released after two years.",
      "\"They can't reach her. They can reach her family.\" said Foroohar. \"So that's always a big concern. But the family is also brave. They're enduring it.\"",
      "In July 2021, four Iranian intelligence officials were charged with a kidnapping conspiracy \u2013 for developing plans to kidnap Alinejad and bring her back to Iran. They allegedly explored slipping her out of the U.S. by travel routes from Alinejad's home to the waterfront in Brooklyn, a maritime evacuation route involving speed boats, and maritime travel from New York to Venezuela, according to the indictment. The conspirators live in Iran, where they remain at large.",
      "The assassination attempts",
      "It is \"chilling\" how close Mehdiyev came to carrying out the plan to kill his wife, said Faroohar.",
      "Medhiyev testified at trial about seeing Alinejad on the porch as he walked by her home, but his gun was in the car. By the time he went back for it, she had left.",
      "\"I was there to try to kill the journalist,\" he admitted.",
      "Medhiyev was a key witness for the prosecution, but the defense tried to undermine his credibility, dubbing him the \"pizza delivery hitman\" after Medhiyev admitted on the stand that he had once planned a kidnapping while working at a pizza shop.",
      "\"As you're coordinating an international kidnapping you're also working at a pizza shop?\" asked Omarov's defense attorney, Elena Fast. \"That's correct,\" he replied.",
      "On the day of his arrest, Mehdiyev had approached the door of Alinejad's home. At the time she was on a Zoom call with Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez and Russian chess player Garry Kasparov. She heard someone on the porch but did not go downstairs.",
      "\"She said, 'I don't know who that is but this call is more important,'\" Lopez recounted over Whatsapp.",
      "\"It was the Zoom call that saved her life,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Medhiyev had sent Omarov a video of him opening a suitcase in the back of his car with an AK-47 style rifle inside. A caption read, \"we are ready.\" Amirov replied, \"keep the car clean.\"",
      "Police arrested Mehdiyev nearby that day after he ran a stop sign. In the back of his car, they discovered the AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition.",
      "Foroohar received a call at work from the FBI asking to \"whisk me away to a safe location.\" He and Alinejad were later told that a man with an AK-47 had been arrested outside their home.",
      "\"It's quite stressful. It's quite scary,\" admitted Foroohar, when asked what it felt like to live under threat. \"At the same time if you think about it too much, you are just paralyzed. So you compartmentalize.\"",
      "\"It's not easy. Sometimes you look over your shoulder,\" he added. \"Sometimes you just learn how to trust.\"",
      "Alinejad and her husband have lived in so many safe houses that they lost track. She has only been back to their Brooklyn home once to make sure the neighbors are watering her garden.",
      "In 2024, it was under surveillance again.",
      "On Nov. 7, Shakeri \u2014 the man assigned to assassinate both Mr. Trump and Alinejad \u2014\u00a0along with Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt were indicted for their alleged involvement in a second murder-for-hire plot on Alinejad's life. Rivera and Loadholt are accused of surveilling her Brooklyn home for months, with the intent to locate and kill her. The Justice Department charged Shakeri with directing \"a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "\"It was very shocking and surprising,\" said Foroohar. \"We thought the whole thing was over and done with. And we don't know when the next one is. We had a conversation with members of the Biden administration, and they said, you better get used to this because Iran is very determined to get rid of Masih, and they're not going to give up.\""

      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, recently directed officials to suspend processing of requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss an action that has not been publicly reported.",
      "The move will, for the time being, place in legal limbo immigrants who were granted refuge in the U.S. because they proved they could be persecuted in their home countries.",
      "Refugees are granted entry into the U.S. after an overseas and exhaustive process of security checks, medical screenings and interviews that typically takes years to complete. Asylees are foreigners in the U.S. who are granted protection by immigration judges or asylum officers. Both populations have to prove they could face persecution because of certain characteristics, such as their political views, race or religion.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted both congressionally enacted programs, suspending the refugee process and closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border through executive orders that are currently facing federal court challenges.",
      "In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the green card processing pause is needed to comply with two executive actions issued by President Trump, including\u00a0one that questioned immigration vetting procedures under the Biden administration.",
      "\"USCIS is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment\" with Mr. Trump's executive actions, DHS said in the statement. \"Adjustment of status\" is the official name of the green card process.",
      "In one of the presidential proclamations cited by officials, Mr. Trump instructed federal agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.\"",
      "The other executive order cited by officials paved the way for the State Department to designate Mexican cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The pause on some green card applications is the latest action taken by the Trump administration to restrict, tighten and, in some cases, suspend legal immigration procedures on the basis of concerns about national security and fraud.",
      "Last month, the administration, citing vetting and fraud concerns, paused all immigration applications filed by immigrants from Latin America and Ukraine who arrived in the U.S. under two Biden-era programs that relied on an authority known as humanitarian parole. The government did not announce that move publicly, but CBS News disclosed it on Feb. 19.",
      "The administration said last week it would give over half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came to the U.S. under one of the programs 30 days to self-deport or face arrest and deportation.

      "Trump administration officials have also announced plans to more heavily scrutinize and review the social media accounts of immigrants applying for legal status, including U.S. citizenship, green cards and asylum. USCIS said the vetting of social media accounts is required for \"the enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.\"",
      "The agency has long reviewed the social media information of immigrants applying for certain immigration benefits, but the new plan would require those applicants to submit their social media accounts, or handles, to the government for review.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 15:08:19 -0400",
    "summary": "As Trump Cabinet members sent texts on Signal, one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia, but the White House says he didn't have his phone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "Goughnour, a Democrat, has spent well over a decade as a police officer in McKeesport and currently serves as supervisor of detectives. He is a Teamster and a first-term member of the school board in McKeesport, where he graduated high school. Goughnour is married and has three children.",
      "The district is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) southeast of Pittsburgh, at the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers. Many of the towns that make up the district were part of the once-thriving steelmaking region, but the area is now economically challenged.",
      "After the House race was called, Goughnour said, \"It's overwhelming, but I feel good.\" He said his goal was to \"maintain common sense in Harrisburg\" and give his district a strong voice.",

    "summary": "Starting Thursday, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting Thursday, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that the panel is seeking an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol after the most recent release, Wicker detailed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Steven Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

    "story": [
      "Public school administrators in Portland, Oregon, are facing a federal civil rights probe over a transgender student-athlete's alleged participation in a girls' track and field meet last week, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday.",
      "The department's Office of Civil Rights has opened an investigation into Portland's school district and the Oregon School Activities Association, a nonprofit that oversees high school sports statewide. Federal officials accused both the school district and the nonprofit of violating Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination and is used at times to challenge trans women and girls who compete on women's and girls' teams.",
      "In this case, the civil rights office has alleged that Portland Public Schools and the activities association  allowed a trans runner to compete in the girls' division of a March 19 interscholastic track and field competition, potentially undercutting Title IX as the runner took first place in two races. The office also said allowing the trans student to use the girls' locker room during the event may violate the statute.",
      "The civil rights office said it sent letters to Kimberly Armstrong, the superintendent of Portland Public Schools, and the activities association, which is the governing body for the Portland Interscholastic League, to inform them of the probe. The office is specifically looking into the activities association's \"gender identity participation\" policy to determine whether it could violate the terms of Title IX.",
      "That policy, according to the activities association, aims to give students opportunities to participate in athletic programs that align with their gender identities, while also upholding safe and fair standards for all students. Developed with the Oregon Department of Education, the activities association  says its policy \"promotes harmony and fair competition among member schools by maintaining equality of eligibility\" and gives more students a chance to participate in interscholastic activities.",
      "The federal civil rights office said it launched the investigation after receiving a complaint that blamed the school district and the activities association  for allegedly allowing an athlete not assigned female at birth \"to compete in the girls' track and field division over the last two seasons.\" The complaint noted the trans runner had won two races \u2014 the girls' 200-meter and 400-meter \u2014 at an interscholastic championship meet in Portland last year and again this year.",
      "\"We will not allow the Portland Public Schools District or any other educational entity that receives federal funds to trample on the antidiscrimination protections that women and girls are guaranteed under law,\" Craig Trainor, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. \"OCR will use every lawful means to ensure that no female athlete is denied equal athletic opportunities or robbed of her rightful accolades.\"",
      "President Trump's return to office in January, and subsequent executive order declaring that \"only two sexes\" will be recognized by the federal government, set the stage for these kinds of investigations to move forward. Standing against the ability of trans athletes to compete in girls' or women's sports was a substantial part of his election campaign, as it had already become a political flashpoint for a number of Republican leaders.",
      "A spokesperson for the activities association told CBS News Wednesday that the organization had just learned about the federal investigation and was consulting its legal counsel to respond to the Department of Education. Armstrong, from the Portland school district, acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the federal civil rights office did receive a complaint, sparking the probe. She said Portland Public Schools \"is fully cooperating with the investigation.\"",
      "\"I stand firm in our legal responsibilities, and I deeply value every student's right to be treated with dignity, safety, and respect,\" her statement continued. Citing \"this complex legal landscape,\" Armstrong added that the district's policies comply with Oregon state laws, \"which may differ from federal guidance.\"",
      "\"While I am limited in what I can share at this time due to the sensitive nature of the matter and our duty to protect student privacy, I want to be clear: my commitment\u2014and our district's commitment\u2014to doing what's right for all students, especially those most vulnerable, remains unwavering,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:04:29 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district court ordered the Department of Education to restore access to grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to intervene in an ongoing dispute over Department of Education grants that were canceled because they funded programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "In a filing with the high court, the Justice Department requested the justices put on hold a temporary order from a lower court requiring the Education Department to restore millions of dollars in grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide relief to the Justice Department and agreed with the district court that the terminations of the grants likely violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "Echoing concerns raised in other emergency appeals filed with the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris took aim at the scope of the lower court's order. The Trump administration has in recent days focused its attacks on nationwide injunctions. More than a dozen have been issued by district courts considering legal challenges to President Trump's policies.",
      "\"This court should put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions,\" she wrote.",
      "The Justice Department has also asked the Supreme Court to step into court fights over Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship and efforts to fire thousands of federal probationary employees. The high court has yet to act on their bids for emergency relief.",
      "The grant programs at issue in the case, the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, or TQP and SEED, relate to efforts to improve the development and quality of teachers. In early February, the acting education secretary ordered a review of all grant awards to ensure that they did not fund so-called DEI practices, which the Trump administration have said are discriminatory. The review found that 104 grants should be terminated because they conflicted with the department's policy objectives.",
      "Roughly one month after the grants were canceled, the eight states filed a lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order from a federal district judge in Massachusetts. Public and private universities, as well as nonprofit groups, in their states received the TQP and SEED grants from the federal government.",
      "The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 argued that the grant cancellations violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the agency rulemaking process, in part because the Department of Education failed to \"provide a transparent and reasonable explanation for the termination of the grants.\"",
      "The district court in Massachusetts issued a temporary restraining order, initially set to remain in place for 14 days, that ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the grants for all recipients in the states. It also temporarily blocked the Education Department from canceling any further grants for beneficiaries in the challenger states.",
      "While the administration began working to reinstate access to the funds, it asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the lower court's order and allow it to continue with the grant cancellations.",
      "But the 1st Circuit rejected the Department of Education's request. The district court later extended its temporary order to remain in place up to April 7 while it considered a bid for longer-term relief.",
      "The case from Massachusetts is not the only challenge to the Education Department's decision to scrap DEI-related grants. In a second dispute filed in Maryland, a federal district court separately ordered the administration to reinstate canceled TQP and SEED grants for members of teacher-education groups.",
      "In its bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration warned that the two orders from courts in Maryland and Massachusetts potentially overlap. The government reiterated its opposition to the broad injunctions that have been issued by district courts in the slew of cases.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the Executive Branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the Executive Branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" Harris wrote.",
      "She argued that the temporary restraining order gives relief to all grant recipients in the states, instead of limiting it to the states or their instrumentalities. The district court, Harris wrote, directed a federal agency and its leaders to immediately make available millions of dollars to fund programs that they determined do not align with the administration's objectives.",
      "\"That is a remarkable intrusion on the operations of the Executive Branch, and the kind of judicial action that this court has routinely decided to review,\" she said.",
      "On the merits of the case, the acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, said the Massachusetts court did not have jurisdiction to consider the states' claims, since the case is effectively a contract dispute that should be heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",

Most warnings, which notify the public of conditions that are ideal for sparking wildfires, were set to remain in effect until Wednesday night.",
      "In North Carolina, fires in Polk County exploded in size over the weekend and has since prompted mandatory evacuations, as emergency crews fought separate fires in an area still recovering from Hurricane Helene. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, the governor declared an emergency in response to the Table Rock Fire, a blaze that grew in the Blue Ridge Mountains. To chart the spread of the blazes in the Carolinas, state agencies have released maps that are updated daily.",
      "Evacuations in North Carolina",
      "The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation on Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina, about 80 miles west of Charlotte. Those evacuation orders remain in place for about 145 properties.",
      "Three wildfires burning in Polk County have spread over nearly 5,754 acres, according to the North Carolina Forest Service, and the two larger fires were not contained at all. Firefighters have been able to contain more than half of a third, smaller fire covering just under 200 acres, the forest service said. Other fires were active in nearby Burke and Madison counties, with a third wildfire burning in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia.",
      "Public safety officials had warned over the weekend of potentially deadly consequences for residents who failed to follow evacuation orders.",
      "\"Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,\" the agency said in a social media post.",
      "It is the second time in less than a month that Polk County residents have faced evacuations due to wildfires, which come after Hurricane Helene devasted the area last year.",
      "\"It's not just the high winds, the low humidity, the steep terrain, but they're also dealing with storm debris that's blocking UTV trails, regular roads, and them just getting in on foot because we have so many trees down,\" Kellie Cannon, a spokesperson for Polk County, told CBS affiliate WSPA.",
      "Cannon said the residents of Polk County are \"extremely resilient\" after enduring Helene and the last round of wildfires earlier this month.",
      "North Carolina's western region was hit hard by\u00a0Hurricane Helene\u00a0in September. The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts.",
      "Emergency declared in South Carolina",
      "In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency amid efforts to stop two blazes that spread quickly in the mountains. One blaze, called the Table Rock Fire, in Pickens County, has grown to about 2,293 acres, or just under 3.6 square miles, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission. The figure includes several hundred acres that firefighters intentionally burned to try to contain the flames, officials said.",
      "A second fire, on Persimmon Ridge in Greenville County, started Saturday and eventually spread over almost 1,000 acres, or roughly 1.5 square miles. Both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires were fanned by strong winds and have been difficult to manage in mountainous terrain, the forestry commission said.",
      "No injuries have been reported and no structures were imminently threatened, officials said. Residents were urged to be prepared to leave their homes if things changed and evacuations became necessary.",
      "Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post.",
      "How did the Table Rock fire start?",
      "Human activity caused both South Carolina fires. In a video on Facebook, Pickens County Sheriff Tommy Blankenship, speaking about the situation at Persimmon Ridge, said the fire was started by the \"negligent act\" of a group of teenage hikers.",
      "The Pickens County Sheriff's Office posted an update late Saturday saying crews had ceased operations and would resume Sunday morning with ground personnel and machinery and assistance from helicopters and air tankers.",
      "\"It's very steep terrain. There is a lot of what we call downed timber, blown debris, that has fallen because of Hurricane Helene,\" South Carolina Forestry Commission Information Officer, Brad Bramlett told\u00a0WSPA. \"That just makes the conditions that much more difficult.\"",

      "Miller Gardner, the youngest son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, died on March 21 at the age of 14 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica.",
      "The investigation into his death is ongoing and the cause remains a mystery. Here is what we know about Miller Gardner's death so far.",
      "What happened to Miller Gardner?",
      "Details surrounding Miller Gardner's death were not immediately clear, but his parents said in a statement that he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill while vacationing. They did not elaborate on who else had gotten sick, what specific illness they were dealing with or what symptoms they had experienced.",
      "Where were the Gardners staying?",
      "The Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San Jos\u00e9.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts go out to the family during this incredibly difficult time,\" the resort said in a statement on Tuesday, March 25. \"The factors that led to this tragic incident are unknown, and we are fully cooperating with authorities as they investigate. We remain committed to supporting our guests and staff, prioritizing their well-being and safety, while respecting the privacy of those affected.\"",
      "The resort also told CBS News that hotel staff responded to the incident according to protocol, saying: \"The hotel staff dispatched a medical team immediately, including a licensed doctor, which arrived to handle the emergency situation. Any medical attention to the family was done by medical professionals. Our staff did not administer any medical treatment.\"",
      "What are officials saying about the cause of death?",
      "A cause of death had yet to be determined. An initial report from investigators in Costa Rica indicated Miller Gardner may have died as a result of asphyxiation following food poisoning, but then officials said in a newer statement that they ruled out asphyxiation as the cause.",
      "\"It is preliminarily ruled out that the cause of death was asphyxiation, because at the time of inspection of the body, no macro-level anomalies were observed in the respiratory tract,\" Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said in a statement on March 25.",
      "The agency did not indicate whether or not food poisoning was still suspected.",
      "It said that three types of analyses would be performed by its forensic science laboratories: Histology (meaning a microscopic study of tissues and cells), toxicology (testing for chemical substances) and neuropathology (referring to the brain, spine and nervous system).",
      "\"In addition, a study was requested at the Costa Rican Institute of Research and Teaching in Nutrition and Health (INCIENSA) of the University of Costa Rica (UCR),\" OIJ said.",
      "\"The results are expected to be available in two to three months, due to the high demand for autopsies being performed in the country, resulting from the increase in homicides,\" the agency said.",
      "Was it food poisoning or \"food intoxication\"?",
      "Before the OIJ had ruled out asphyxiation, an initial statement said:\u00a0\"Preliminary reports indicate the cause of death is asphyxiation following possible food poisoning.\"",
      "Some news outlets quoted a local official who cited possible \"food intoxication,\" but there is no condition by that name, and it appears in this context to have meant the same thing as food poisoning.",
      "There has been no official confirmation on whether food poisoning is still suspected and, per the OIJ's most recent statement, it could take several months before a cause of death is determined.",
      "Following the reports of possible food poisoning, Hotel La Mariposa, located less than a mile from where the Gardners were staying, released a statement to address what it called \"misinformation circulating on social media.\"",
      "\"The Gardner family dined at our restaurant, Le Papillon, on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 18, 2025\u2014three days before Miller's tragic passing. Any claims suggesting a link between our restaurant and this heartbreaking event are entirely false and unfounded,\" the restaurant said. \"Any news, statements, or claims to the contrary do not reflect the reality of the situation. Furthermore, we do not have any additional information, as the Gardner family did not stay at our hotel.\" The hotel also extended its \"heartfelt condolences to the Gardner family.\"",

Additionally, on March 14th, we had an inspection by the Health Ministry in which the hotel passed with a 98.5 out of 100.\"",
      "What has the Gardner family said?",
      "In a statement, Miller Gardner's parents, Brett and Jessica Gardner, said they have \"so many questions and so few answers at this point.\"",
      "\"Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,\" they said. \"He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.\"",
      "\"We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss,\" their statement continued. \"Our prayers go out to Miller's teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.\"",
      "What have the New York Yankees said?",
      "The New York Yankees, where Brett Gardner played for 14 years, released the following statement after news of Miller Gardner's death became public.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "The administration has appealed the judge's order.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, has questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese decent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:54:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court was considering a challenge to a 2022 regulation that sought to regulate ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, delivering a win for federal efforts to curb gun violence.",
      "The high court ruled 7-2 in finding that the rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is not facially inconsistent with federal firearms law. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the opinion for the majority.",
      "\"The GCA embraces, and thus permits ATF to regulate, some weapon parts kits and unfinished frames or receivers, including those we have discussed,\" Gorsuch wrote, referencing the Gun Control Act of 1968.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court did not involve the Second Amendment, but whether ATF went too far when it issued the rule subjecting ghost guns to the same requirements as commercial firearms.",
      "It follows a decision from the high court last year that struck down a measure from the first Trump administration that outlawed bump stocks, which are devices that increase a firearm's rate of fire. It's unclear whether President Trump will keep the regulation in place or take steps to rescind it.",
      "Gorsuch's opinion included images of a \"Buy Build Shoot\" weapon parts kit from Polymer80, a seller of the kits, and a completed firearm constructed from the parts. He called the finished product \"an instrument of combat.\"",
      "\"No one would confuse the semiautomatic pistol pictured above with a tool or a toy,\" he wrote. \"Of course, as sold, the kit requires some assembly. But a number of considerations persuade us that, even as sold, the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit qualifies as a 'weapon.'\"",
      "Gorsuch acknowledged that while it may take roughly 30 minutes to construct a firearm out of the kit, it \"comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious.\"",
      "\"Really, the kit's name says it all: 'Buy Build Shoot,'\" he wrote.",
      "Writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of rewriting the law to regulate weapon parts kits and said it \"blesses the government's overreach based on a series of errors.\"",
      "\"Congress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not,\" he said. \"I would adhere to the words Congress enacted.\"",
      "Gun violence prevention groups cheered the Supreme Court's decision, calling it a victory for public safety.",
      "\"Ghost guns are the gun industry's way of skirting commonsense gun laws and arming dangerous people without background checks. We are thrilled that the Supreme Court has upheld the ATF rule that treats ghost guns as what they are: guns,\" said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel, Giffords Law Center, in a statement.",
      "The court was considering an appeal from the Biden administration of a lower court ruling that struck down the measure.",
      "The regulation, issued in 2022, sought to address a surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, which can be made with 3D printers or kits and parts available online. The weapons don't have serial numbers or transfer records, making them difficult for law enforcement to trace and attractive to people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms.",
      "The rule clarified the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to include a weapon parts kit that can be assembled into an operational weapon in less than 30 minutes, and the incomplete frame of a handgun or receiver of a rifle.",
      "By seeking to regulate the kits under the decades-old law, the rule subjects ghost gun manufacturers and sellers to the same requirements as commercial gun makers, meaning they have to be licensed, mark their products with serial numbers, maintain certain records and run background checks on interested buyers.",
      "Shortly before the regulation took effect, gun owners, advocacy groups and the makers of parts kits challenged it in federal court, arguing that ATF didn't have the authority to change the definition of \"firearm\" to cover weapon parts kits.",
      "A federal district court judge and a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit struck down the rule. The appeals court found that Congress did not authorize ATF to regulate kits under the Gun Control Act.",
      "The Biden administration had warned the Supreme Court that if it were to strike down the rule, then minors, criminals and others who cannot have guns could instead buy kits that could be assembled into a functioning, untraceable firearm in a matter of minutes.",
      "The Justice Department said the measure has been successful at addressing the surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, and the market for the weapons has effectively collapsed in the nearly two years the rule has been in place.",
      "A group of major U.S. cities also said the regulation has been effective at reducing the use of ghost guns in their municipalities. In New York, ghost gun recoveries fell in 2023 for the first time in four years, and in Baltimore, they decreased in 2023 for the first time since 2019.",
      "During an earlier stage in the litigation over the Biden administration's rule, the Supreme Court allowed ATF to enforce the requirements until it issued a decision.",
      "The court's majority said that there are limits to its decision, and that while some parts kits qualify as weapons that can be regulated, not all do.",
      "\"Weapon parts kits vary widely. Not all come as complete as the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit. Some, too, may require more time, expertise, or specialized tools to finish,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"And at some point a kit may be so incomplete or cumbersome to assemble that it can no longer fairly be described as a 'weapon,'\" capable of being converted into a working firearm.",
      "He continued: \"While we recognize the problem, this case does not require us to untangle exactly how far\" the law reaches.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",
      "While Congress has the power to regulate voting \u2014 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" for elections.",
      "Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an \"unlawful\" weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is \"trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\" And Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order \"is not just misguided \u2014 it is immoral and illegal.\"",
      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",
      "Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a \"welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.\"",
      "At least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post, \"This will not stand. We will sue.\"",
      "The president has long claimed elections were being rigged, even before the results were known. He's battled certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, falsely blaming\u00a0widespread fraud for his loss.",

      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",

      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue. Last month, the House included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion in its budget proposal, which serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda.

    "summary": "President Trump told reporters he does not believe national security adviser Mike Waltz should apologize for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal group chat.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday defended national security adviser Mike Waltz as his administration faces questions about its use of the encrypted messaging app Signal after a reporter was mistakenly added to a group chat detailing highly sensitive plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the information that was discussed on the 18-member group chat, which included high-ranking officials like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was not classified and said Waltz is a \"very good man\" who will \"continue to do a good job.\"",
      "\"I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best,\" the president said of Waltz. \"It's equipment and technology that's not perfect and probably he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night, Waltz called the situation \"embarrassing\" and said he takes \"full responsibility,\" adding that he \"built\" the Signal chat group.",
      "However, he claimed that he did not have Goldberg's contact information on his phone and is unsure how Goldberg's number got there, or how Goldberg got into the chat.",
      "\"I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,\" Waltz said. \"And we're going to figure out how this happened.\"",
      "Waltz also said that a staffer did not put Goldberg's contact information into the phone.",
      "The Trump administration's use of the app to detail the plans to bomb Houthi targets on March 15 was revealed Monday by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who wrote in a piece that he was added to a chat on Signal by an account that shared Waltz's name earlier this month.",
      "Several days later, an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out plans for strikes in Yemen, which included information about \"weapons packages, targets and timing\" shortly before the attack took place, Goldberg wrote.",
      "Among those included in the chat were accounts that appeared to belong to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg's account. Witkoff was in Moscow when he was added to the group chat, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting found.",
      "Hegseth denied any war plans were discussed, but the National Security Council said in a statement to CBS News on Monday that the message thread detailed by Goldberg \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The breach sparked immediate condemnation of the Trump administration from congressional Democrats and raised questions about the use of Signal on government or personal devices, as well as whether top U.S. officials were sharing classified information.",
      "In a letter sent to Mr. Trump Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \"Hegseth should be fired immediately.\"",
      "\"The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans\u2014including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used\u2014during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,\" Jeffries wrote. \"His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters that he believes his administration will limit its use of Signal in the future, though he acknowledged that \"a lot of people\" across the federal government rely on the app.",
      "\"I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again,\" he said. \"We may be forced to use it. We may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety and may be forced to use it. Generally speaking, I think we won't be using it very much.\"",
      "The president questioned whether the app has vulnerabilities that allow other users to hack into conversations.",
      "\"I think Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Waltz said technical experts and legal teams will look into the issue.",
      "\"Of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,\" he said. \"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger.\"",
      "Waltz later attacked Goldberg and claimed he and other reporters in Washington, D.C., have \"made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.\"",
      "\"This one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we're looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" he said.",
      "Waltz told the president that Goldberg is attempting to deflect attention away from the \"freedom that you're enabling,\" and said \"the world owes President Trump a favor.\"",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard both appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Tuesday and faced questions from senators about the controversy. The two denied classified information was exchanged in the group chat, but Ratcliffe confirmed he was a participant in the thread.",
      "Ratcliffe added that Signal was on his agency computer when he took the helm of the CIA earlier this year and said it's \"permissible\" to use it to communicate and coordinate \"for work purposes.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",

      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",

The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors.

      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",

      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

      "The Trump administration invoked a state secrets privilege Monday and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under war authorities.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process. It's a case that has become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and the federal courts.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said Nazis detained in the U.S. during World World II received better legal treatment than Venezuelan immigrants who were were deported to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett is one of three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "President Trump's administration appealed after Boasberg blocked those deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Just after midnight Monday, Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg's impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.",
      "During a hearing Friday, Boasberg vowed to determine whether the government defied his oral order from the bench to turn planes around. The Justice Department has said that the judge's oral directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",

      "News of the NSA bulletin comes amid the continued fallout from an explosive article published Monday in The Atlantic. The publication's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, detailed how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth inadvertently disclosed war plans to him in an encrypted Signal chat group two hours before the U.S. military launched attacks against Houthi militia in Yemen. Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",

      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",
      "In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has \"no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride.\"",

Waltz had been expected to visit the Pituffik Space Base, a source familiar with the plans told CBS News on Sunday. The vice president's office said after Vance's announcement on Tuesday that the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members. The base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut that had previously been announced.",

      "The plans were criticized Monday by Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who said Washington was interfering in Greenland's internal affairs, according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "\"It should be said clearly that our integrity and democracy must be respected without foreign interference,\" AFP quoted Egede as saying, adding that it \"cannot be seen as just a private visit.\"",

      "The second lady has already made a number of overseas trips, having visited Paris in February and India earlier this month. The White House said Sunday that Usha Vance would be joined by her son and a U.S. delegation.",
      "President Trump first expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, which is currently a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, during his first administration. He has ramped up the effort since taking office two months ago. In his first speech before a joint session of Congress of his second term, Mr. Trump vowed that \"we're going to get it.\"",

      "Egede responded at the time, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continues to insist it didn't defy a federal judge's order when it failed to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order blocking the deportations of alleged gang members who hadn't been afforded due process. It's a case that's become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and federal courts.",
      "In a 14-page document\u00a0filed late Tuesday night, the Justice Department spelled out before Boasberg why it didn't turn around the two flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members despite his verbal order to do so.",
      "\"These removals both complied with the law and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. The Government will continue to defend the removals before this Court and, if necessary, on appeal challenging this Court's two injunctions issued on March 15,\" the filing reads. It's signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior DOJ officials.",
      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. The law has only been invoked three times throughout American history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's assertions that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She's the one who didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, also an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",

      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",

Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",

      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

      "Russia and Ukraine have agreed to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,\" the Trump administration said Tuesday, claiming a limited advance in efforts to broker a peace deal between the two countries.",
      "The agreements were announced in separate statements by the White House after U.S. officials held separate bilateral talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",

    "summary": "The National Security Council said the message thread \"appears to be authentic\" and the administration is \"reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A number of lawmakers expressed outrage Monday after the editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a group chat\u00a0involving top Trump administration officials about the United States' highly sensitive war plans in Yemen.",
      "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. It is likely to become a topic of questioning as leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to testify about global security threats facing the country.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen.",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately,\" Reed's statement said.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It's definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made.\"",
      "\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it.",
      "In a\u00a0piece\u00a0published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",
      "The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.",
      "The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"",
      "Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"",
      "He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",
      "Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.",
      "Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",
      "\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"",
      "\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",
      "Johnson added that he didn't think Waltz, who apparently started the group chat and included the journalist, according to Goldberg's report, should be disciplined.",

    "summary": "President Trump says the U.S. needs control of Greenland and the Panama Canal \"for national security.\" Here's why both places are so important.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump repeated vows to secure U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal in his speech to a joint a session of Congress on March 4.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Greenland's prime minister responded, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "Now, second lady\u00a0Usha Vance\u00a0is expected to visit Greenland this week, according to the White House, and national security adviser Mike Waltz will visit in a separate trip.\u00a0Donald Trump Jr. visited in January\u00a0before the president took office.",
      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada and is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The largest island in the world, but home to only around 60,000 people, it is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

    "summary": "South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, but didn't rule on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's Constitutional Court on Monday overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader, while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "Many observers said Monday's ruling doesn't signal much on the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn't a key figure in Yoon's martial law imposition. But it could still embolden Yoon's staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Han became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly over his Dec. 3 imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis. But Han was impeached by the assembly as well in late December following political strife with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified a domestic division and deepened worries about the country's diplomatic and economic activities. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, had since serving as acting president.",
      "On Monday, seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.",
      "Dismissing Han would have needed the support of at least six court justices.",
      "Following his reinstatement, Han told reporters he would focus on the \"most urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. He also called for a national unity, saying \"there's no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",
      "The court has yet to rule on Yoon's impeachment. If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a election for a new president. If it rules for him, Yoon will be restored to office and regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon was impeached about two weeks earlier than Han. Observers earlier predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March but it hasn't done so.",
      "Yoon has been separately arrested and charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. If convicted of that charge, he would face the death penalty or a life sentence. On March 8, Yoon was released from prison, after a Seoul district court allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "At the center of squabbling over Yoon is why he sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he aims to maintain order, but senior military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down unanimously.",
      "Han, a career diplomat who was appointed by Yoon, had attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets, when he served as acting president. A major trigger for the opposition's push for his impeachment was Han's refusal to fill three vacancies on the nine-member Constitutional Court bench.",
      "Restoring the court's full membership was sensitive because a ruling upholding Yoon's impeachment requires support from at least six justices.",
      "Han's successor, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Both Han and Choi cited needing bipartisan consent to add justices to the court, but their critics suspected they were siding with Yoon's People Power Party, which wanted to increase Yoon's chances of returning to power. On Friday, the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion on Choi.",

      "Venezuela accepted the deal to guarantee the \"the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "In his statement, Rodr\u00edguez referred to the deportation by President Trump's government of several hundred Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "\"Migrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "U.S. officials confirmed Sunday night the first flight had arrived in Venezuela, saying it carried 199 people, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The officials did not specify how many were alleged Tren de Aragua members or how their affiliations were determined.",
      "Maduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.",

      "\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "In recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",

      "Overnight into Sunday, Israeli strikes across the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 26 Palestinians, including a Hamas political leader and several women and children.",
      "Residents said tanks had advanced into an area of the southern city of Rafah as the military ordered it evacuated.",
      "Palestinian men, women and children could be seen walking along a dirt road and carrying their belongings in their arms, a recurring scene in a war that has forced most of Gaza's population to flee from the territory.",
      "\"It's displacement under fire,\" said Mustafa Gaber, a local journalist who left Tel al-Sultan with his family. In a video call, he said hundreds of people were fleeing as tank and drone fire echoed nearby. \"There are wounded people among us. The situation is very difficult,\" he said.",
      "The Israeli Defense Forces said the operation in Tel al-Sultan targeted \"terror infrastructure sites\" and sought to \"eliminate terrorists in the area, in order to reinforce control and expand the security zone in southern Gaza.\"",

      "The Hamas-led Gaza's Health Ministry said a total of 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and more than 113,000 have been wounded. The latest toll announced Sunday includes 673 people killed since Israel's surprise bombardment on Tuesday as well as 233 bodies that were recently identified, the ministry said.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records but has said women and children make up more than half the dead. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it instructed the army to respond forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based. Israel's army said six rockets were fired toward Metula, a town along the border with Lebanon. Three crossed into Israel and were intercepted.",
      "The army said it \"cannot confirm the identity of the organization that fired the rockets.\" It said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers.",

      "Another Israeli strike Saturday night hit a garage in the coastal city of Tyre, the NNA reported, with one person killed and seven wounded. It was the first attack on the city since the ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. And a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA.",
      "A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press Saturday that it was not responsible for the initial attack, calling it \"primitive,\" speaking on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "In a statement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south but said the country did not want to return to war.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.",
      "Under the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel.",
      "But since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.",
      "The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.",
      "The strikes on Lebanon come a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza \"with increasing intensity\" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds \u2014 24 of whom are believed alive.",
      "The attack by Hamas-led militants in 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "The airport also said in a statement that \"We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers traveling through the airport.\"",
      "On Friday, a fire at an electrical substation cut power to the airport for most of the day. The outage affected more than 1,300 flights to and from Heathrow and disrupted travel for more than 200,000 passengers. The outage also cut power to over 16,000 homes in the area.",
      "The ripple effect of the transportation hub shutting down for over 16 hours was immediate. About 1 million Americans travel through Heathrow each month.",
      "\"The pilot came on and said some of us may have noticed that the plane was turning around, not to be alarmed, but London Heathrow was closed due to a fire,\" said Justin McLane, who flew from Boston.",
      "Meanwhile, pressure mounted on airlines and Heathrow to take care of passengers.",
      "\"Contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100%, and this is one of them,\" said Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow's chief executive. \"This has been a major incident. I mean, short of anybody getting hurt, this is as big as it gets for our airport and we are actually coming back quite fast.\"",

      "\"We were like 'Oh my God, I cannot believe this is happening,'\" Esquete said. \"Everybody agreed that we had to go there.\"",

      "Almost immediately, the researchers started seeing things that humans had never laid eyes on before.",
      "\"The first thing we saw was a huge sponge with a crab on it,\" Esquete said. \"That's already quite amazing, because one question that we had is 'Will there be any life at all?'\"",
      "Sponges grow very slowly \u2014 sometimes less than two centimeters a year. To get this big, the scientists say, the ecosystem has been thriving for a long time \u2014 possibly even centuries.",
      "The remotely operated vehicle explored the seafloor for eight days, the institute said. It also discovered large corals and more sponges, which were supporting species including icefish, giant sea spiders and octopi.",

      "Since January, scientists have confirmed the existence of at least six new species, Virmani said, but there are \"many more yet to be analyzed.\"",
      "Because Schmidt Ocean Institute makes all of its research, data and livestreams open access, the information is available for other scientists to explore and analyze.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:35:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Under pressure from Trump and with Russia menacing, Germany's incoming leader plans to revamp the country's defense posture. Can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by\u00a0Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.",
      "On Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

Say, a three-month run or two-month run, the Kennedy Center, and then you bring it to Broadway and give the Kennedy Center a piece of those profits. Maybe there's a[n] economic model that makes sense and something that is publicly supported a bit to help these producers take risks, mount things that will actually resonate with audiences.

The \"Argo\" star noted that while people have speculated about the issues that led to his divorce from JLo, the real reason is much more ordinary than anyone might believe. Affleck and Lopez's different approaches to fame have been mentioned as the cause of their split after the premiere of Lopez' documentary, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" but the \"Air\" director emphasized it \"wasn't the cause of some major fracture.\"",
      "\"Part of it was, \u2018OK, if I\u2019m going to participate in this, I want to try to do it in an honest way and in a way that\u2019s interesting.\u2019 Because I thought it was an interesting examination,\" Affleck explained in a cover story for GQ magazine. \"There are a lot of people who I think have handled celebrity more adeptly and more adroitly than I have, Jennifer among them.",
      "\"My temperament is to be a little bit more reserved and private than hers. As happens in relationships, you don\u2019t always have the same attitude towards these things. And so I thought, 'Oh, this is interesting, because how do you reconcile that?",

      "\"I have nothing but respect [for Lopez]. I guess there\u2019s a tendency to look at breakups and want to identify root causes or something. But, honestly, like I said, the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting.\"",

      "\"This distinction is crucial because visceral fat, which accumulates around the abdominal organs, is more metabolically active and has been implicated in adverse health outcomes, including insulin resistance, inflammation and abnormal blood fat levels. Consequently, individuals with similar BMIs may have distinct cancer risks due to differences in fat distribution.\"",
      "Why the difference between men and women?",
      "One potential reason for the gender discrepancy, according to the researchers, is that men are more likely to store fat viscerally (in the belly), while women generally accumulate more subcutaneous fat (under the skin) and peripheral fat (in the arms and legs).",
      "ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND PARKINSON\u2019S RISK IS HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WITH BODY FAT IN TWO SPECIFIC AREAS",

      "Strength training three times per week is ideal, one doctor advised. \"Resistance training reduces visceral fat and inflammation.\" (iStock)",
      "Osborn reiterated that BMI is limited in its ability to accurately measure excess fat.",

      "Minimizing risk",
      "To reduce cancer risk, Osborn recommends that men measure their waistlines to ensure they're in a healthy range. People can also track their visceral fat score on a medical-grade anthropometry scale, he said.",
      "\"Understand that belly fat isn\u2019t just cosmetic \u2014 it\u2019s carcinogenic.\"",

No sources. No methods. And no classified information. Those are some really s----- war plans.

      "EXCLUSIVE: A leading conservation group that champions collaboration over regulation is releasing its top 10 recommendations for the Department of the Interior to cut so-called \"green tape\" \u2013 as opposed to \"red tape\" \u2013 which seeks to streamline the agency's work.",
      "The Montana-based Property and Environment Research Center (PERC), a nonpartisan leader in \"market solutions\" for conservation, will seek to triple the rate of endangered species\u2019 recovery, double fee revenues for national parks without putting all the onus on visitors and eliminate regulations for Americans who voluntarily want to provide assistance in managing habitat restoration.",
      "PERC CEO Brian Yablonski told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that there is a $23 billion backlog in national parks\u2019 infrastructure needs, conservation projects and wastewater management.",
      "As parks grow and visitor numbers hit record levels, the Interior Department needs a responsible way to fund the increased needs without burdening U.S. taxpayers or implementing restrictions, Yablonski said.",

      "A view of Delicate Arch as seen through Frame Arch in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah. (Photo by Robert Alexander/Archive Photos/Getty Images)",
      "\"One way to address the needs of our national parks directly is to connect funding with demand,\" Yablonski said.",
      "Doubling fee revenue does not mean doubling fees, he said, noting that in other countries, American visitors often pay a surcharge to that park system because they do not contribute any of the baseline taxes to park conservation.",
      "In that way, a visitor to Skyline Drive who hails from abroad should be charged a little more than a local Virginian going from Staunton to Front Royal who already pays into park coffers through taxation, he said.",
      "However, Yablonski underlined that the national park system is unique in that 80% of fee revenue collected at any particular park stays to support that park specifically. The other 20% goes elsewhere, including into general funds supporting parks that do not charge fees. It would also \"depoliticize\" park funding because fees are collected independently of Congress.",
      "Record increases in park visitors \u2013 according to the National Park Service (NPS) \u2013 have shown that people are willing to pay to enjoy America\u2019s parkland. Therefore, an increase in the $80 America the Beautiful pass would be one area where there may not be much pain for eager park visitors. NPS reported nearly 332 million visits to parks in 2024, an increase of 6.3 million.",
      "TRUMP INTERIOR PICK FACES SENATE SCRUTINY",
      "The pass gets Americans into many national parks for free, allows entrance to Skyline Drive and also gives the bearer free parking at other park-owned properties, such as the Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, Amtrak station.",
      "Reducing obstacles to voluntary conservation is one of the best ways to cut \u2018green tape\u2019,\" Yablonski said. Landowners seeking to aid voluntary conservation must currently go through an at-times costly and/or strung-out chronological process before they can formally assist the agency.",
      "\"It can take up to a year to get those kind of agreements approved,\" Yablonski said. \"We just think there's a way to streamline that and get those agreements approved sooner, especially if a landowner is taking measures to do voluntary conservation on his or her land,\" he said.",
      "That \"green tape\" cut leads into PERC\u2019s recommendations regarding the Endangered Species Act, Yablonski added.",
      "While the act has been effective in preventing extinction, it has not helped recover species listed as endangered.",
      "Only 3% of endangered species have recovered and been taken off the list, while 99% remain extant.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That\u2019s because the tools needed for both are different. A tool to prevent extinction might be a more regulatory-oriented tool to actually recover something and proactively improve. It is going to be more of a market-based incentive,\" he said.",
      "\"The problem is we're using the regulatory tool when we should be using the incentive-based tool. And so the idea of cutting green tape is actually what are some of the new tools to take in endangered species recovery from a number like 3% and get it to 10%. And I think it's important to set goals because there are folks that seem to be okay with 3% recovery in the environmental community, which to me is shocking. We should want to try something different, try new things, bring new tools to bear to increase endangered species recovery.\"",

The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document.

      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",

      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "1) Opt out of arbitration: If you wish to retain your right to sue the company in case of future issues, opt out of arbitration agreements by emailing your notification to opt out of arbitration arbitrationoptout@23andme.com within 30 days of first use.",
      "2) Review privacy preferences: Regularly check your privacy and data-sharing settings to ensure they align with your comfort level.",
      "3) Limit research participation: Disable participation in research or product development initiatives if you\u2019re concerned about how your data might be used.",
      "4) Download and secure your data: Before considering account deletion, download your genetic record and store it securely on an encrypted device or cloud service.",
      "5) Request data deletion: If you no longer wish for your data to be stored by 23andMe, request its deletion through your account settings. Ensure you also ask for the destruction of any physical samples.",
      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach. Enable two-factor authentication wherever it\u2019s offered to add an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\u00a0Check out my best expert-reviewed password managers for 2025 here.",
      "7) Monitor for suspicious activity and use identity theft protection: Genetic data leaks can lead to identity theft or medical fraud. Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

The iOS 18.2 update, released in December, patched the vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS for all network communications within the Passwords app, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or redirect traffic.",
      "If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad with the Passwords app, ensure your device is updated to iOS 18.2 or later. This ensures you\u2019re protected from this vulnerability. If you haven\u2019t updated yet and used the app on public Wi-Fi between September and December 2024, consider changing passwords for any accounts you accessed during that period, just to be safe.",

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence on the entertainment industry on 'Fox News Sunday.'",
      "Most of us have at least one young woman in our lives that we cherish \u2014 a daughter, niece or goddaughter, for example. Well, this International Women\u2019s Day, I learned something that should be concerning to us all. Fully\u00a096% of all deepfakes \u2014 artificial intelligence-generated images and videos that use someone\u2019s likeness \u2014 are pornographic and target women without their consent.",
      "One well-known case involved an Australian law student who discovered that manipulated pornographic images of her were being shared online when she was just 18. But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",
      "But this isn\u2019t the only type of online abuse women face.",
      "According to the same survey, one in four women in the U.S. say they\u2019ve experienced online abuse, including cyberbullying, doxxing, sexual harassment, trolling and AI deepfakes. And young women between the ages of 18 and 34 appear to experience much higher rates of online abuse than older generations.",

      "A woman with her daughter working on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why are younger women at higher risk?",
      "It probably has a lot to do with how much time younger people spend online.\u00a0Research shows, to no one\u2019s surprise, that younger generations use social media twice as much as older generations (80% versus 42%, respectively). However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations. Growing up in a digital-first world, many younger people appear to be desensitized to data collection and are more willing to share personal information online. That, in turn, puts them at higher risk of cybercrimes and abuse.",

The IRS has been sending out COVID-19 stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 to around 1 million tax filers who missed them. Initially, these payments were self-claimed, but now the IRS is automatically issuing them to ensure eligible taxpayers get what they\u2019re owed.",
      "This provision, known as the\u00a0Recovery Rebate Credit, allows people to claim missed stimulus payments from 2021. If you were eligible but didn\u2019t receive the funds, you can still claim them by filing a tax return by April 15, 2025. Payments will be deposited directly using the banking information listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or sent as a paper check.",
      "However, TIGTA is warning that scammers are targeting taxpayers with fraudulent text messages, as reported by\u00a0TaxAct. These fake texts claim that recipients will receive an Economic Impact Payment from the IRS and often ask for sensitive personal information, like bank account details or your Social Security number. Scammers use this information to steal your identity or financial data.",

Hackers often send\u00a0phishing links that\u00a0impersonate a government agency, someone you know or a trusted brand, tricking you into clicking.

      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",

If you receive a text message from the IRS asking you to provide personal information, it\u2019s a red flag; it\u2019s not from them. Be especially cautious of any links included in the message. A legitimate URL will always end in \".gov.\" However, scammers may try to trick you by altering the link slightly, so look closely for any misspellings or strange characters.

      "Aria Gen 2 augmented reality glasses (Meta)",
      "Key features and improvements",
      "Aria Gen 2 features an impressive array of upgrades from its predecessor. The glasses feature an advanced sensor suite that includes an RGB camera, 6DOF SLAM cameras, eye-tracking cameras and spatial microphones. One of the most innovative additions is a set of sensors embedded in the nosepad: a PPG sensor for heart rate monitoring and a contact microphone to distinguish the wearer's voice from others. This level of sophistication in sensor technology opens up new possibilities for research and development in AR applications.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Meta has also made significant strides in on-device processing capabilities. The company's custom silicon enables local processing of SLAM, eye tracking, hand tracking and speech recognition, reducing latency and enhancing the overall user experience. Despite these advanced features, Aria Gen 2 remains remarkably lightweight at just 75 grams and offers an impressive six to eight hours of continuous use. The glasses also feature foldable arms for easy portability, making them ideal for extended research sessions.",

In the field of machine perception, these glasses enable researchers to explore how AI systems can better understand the world from a human perspective. This has far-reaching implications for the development of more intuitive and context-aware AI systems.",
      "Accessibility research has already benefited from the Aria project. Initiatives like the NavCog project at Carnegie Mellon University have utilized earlier versions of Aria glasses to develop navigation aids for visually impaired individuals. With the enhanced capabilities of Aria Gen 2, companies like Envision are exploring the integration of AI assistants and spatial audio to further improve indoor navigation and accessibility experiences.",
      "The potential applications extend to robotics and AI as well. Researchers at Georgia Tech have demonstrated how the Aria Research Kit can help humanoid robots learn to assist people in home environments. This intersection of AR technology and robotics could lead to significant advancements in human-robot interaction and assistance.",

      "Potential future impact",
      "While Aria Gen 2 is\u00a0currently a research tool, it offers amazing insights into the future capabilities of consumer AR glasses. The inclusion of a heart rate sensor suggests potential health-focused features in future eyewear, allowing for seamless health monitoring throughout the day. The spatial audio capabilities could be used to guide users to specific locations or help find lost items, enhancing everyday navigation and task completion.",
      "The hand and eye tracking technologies incorporated into Aria Gen 2 point towards more intuitive interfaces for future AR devices. These features could enable users to interact with digital content in their field of view naturally, without the need for additional controllers or input devices.",
      "These glasses, while not intended for consumer use, offer a glimpse into the future of AR and AI integration in everyday eyewear. The advancements made in Aria Gen 2 are likely to influence the development of consumer-grade AR glasses, potentially leading to more capable, comfortable and user-friendly devices in the coming years.",

These glasses are packed with all sorts of high-tech goodies: advanced sensors, on-device processing, AI integration, the works.",
      "While we probably won't see all these fancy features in the AR glasses we can buy anytime soon, it's still great to imagine what's coming down the pipeline. Just think about it: One day, we might be wearing glasses that can monitor our health, help us navigate unfamiliar places or even assist those with visual impairments.

      "Israel\u2019s war in Gaza resumed in full force last week after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire and a deadlock in negotiations over the release of the remaining hostages. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a new wave of airstrikes, quickly followed by coordinated ground operations in three key areas: the Netzarim Corridor, Gaza\u2019s northern coastline and the Rafah district in the south.",
      "With expanded U.S. support and favorable shifts in the regional landscape, this next phase signals a significant evolution in Israel\u2019s military objectives, from degrading Hamas\u2019s battlefield capabilities to dismantling its ability to govern.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been fighting them for 10 days,\" said Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror (res.), former Israeli national security advisor. \"All they\u2019ve managed to do is fire seven rockets. That tells you how much damage we\u2019ve inflicted already.\"",

      "IDF troops encircled Tel al-Sultan in Rafah, Gaza, as they dismantled terrorist infrastructure in the area. The IDF said the operation was to reinforce control and expand the security zone in southern Gaza. (IDF)",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital: \"We seized weapons caches, labs, and command centers. Hamas today is not functioning like an army. It\u2019s a dangerous terror group, but it\u2019s not what it was on October 7.\"",
      "According to Israeli data, most of Hamas\u2019s senior command has been eliminated and only fragmented units remain.",
      "\"They\u2019ve lost their experienced leadership,\" the official said. \"They\u2019re operating in survival mode.\"",
      "This time, Israel is operating under dramatically improved conditions, both militarily and diplomatically.",
      "\"The strategic environment has changed,\" Amidror told Fox News Digital. \"Hezbollah is weaker, Iran is constrained, and the American administration is offering us true support. They\u2019re not telling us where to bomb or how to fight.\"",
      "With fewer threats on other fronts and strong backing from the Trump administration, the IDF has broadened its scope to include Hamas\u2019s political leadership.",
      "\"We\u2019re not just degrading military capabilities anymore,\" Amidror said. \"We\u2019re dismantling the structure that allowed Hamas to govern.\"",
      "During the pause in fighting, Hamas consolidated control over humanitarian aid, confiscating supplies, reselling goods and using them to recruit fighters and maintain loyalty. Israeli officials now say that won\u2019t be allowed to continue.",

He noted that Gaza currently has sufficient food reserves and that Israel is developing new delivery mechanisms that bypass Hamas entirely.",
      "Fifty-nine Israeli hostages remain in Hamas captivity. Their continued detention has sparked nationwide protests, with families urging the government to prioritize a negotiated release. But the renewed fighting puts those hostages in greater danger.",
      "\"The only real limitation is the hostages,\" Amidror acknowledged. \"We want them alive, and fighting a war while trying to protect them is a huge challenge.\"",
      "Israel's Channel 12 news' chief political analyst, Amit Segal, reported on Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the country's parliament that as long as Hamas doesn't free the hostages, more pressure will be exerted on the terrorist group, including seizing land.",
      "\"My position is that first we have to get the hostages back, even if we need to commit to end the war and pull back to a security perimeter,\" said Ram Ben Barak, former deputy head of Mossad and current Knesset member. \"We can commit to that, but only if Hamas gives all the hostages back. If they don\u2019t, that alone is a reason to go back to war. And even if Hamas does return them, we\u2019ll be watching. If Hamas starts smuggling weapons again or training fighters, that, too, will be a reason to go in and hit them hard.\"",

      "\"They released a group of hostages earlier than planned because of the pressure we applied in Netzarim when they refused to release Arbel Yehud,\" he said.",

      "Ben Barak said Israel can't remain in Gaza long-term: \"If we stay like we did in Lebanon for 19 years, we\u2019ll leave in shame. The only way to win is to have someone else replace Hamas and govern Gaza.\"",
      "He also pointed to the West Bank as a partial model: \"In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority governs, and we operate from the perimeter when needed. We need the same in Gaza: an internationally backed civil authority that rebuilds the [Gaza] Strip and keeps Hamas out.\"",
      "Still, he cautioned against illusions of peace.",
      "\"There won\u2019t be peace in the next 20 years. But like Egypt did with the Muslim Brotherhood, we can suppress Hamas\u2019s ideology and stop it from taking root again.\"",
      "Ben Barak also said Gazans who wish to leave should be allowed to: \"Let them out. If they have visas and want to go, Israel should let them. It will make military operations easier in a less densely populated area.\"",

      "A major trigger for the opposition\u2019s push to impeach Han was his refusal to fill three vacant seats at the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench. That was a highly explosive issue because the court needed support from at least six justices to approve Yoon's impeachment and filling its empty posts could make such a decision more likely.",

      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified to\u00a0the Senate Intelligence Committee\u00a0on Tuesday that Hegseth and the Defense Department had the \u201cclassification authority\u201d to decide whether certain military information was classified or not.",
      "Their answers raised the possibility that Hegseth had revealed classified information on the group chat or that he had declassified the information beforehand.",
      "Asked by reporters whether he declassified the information he put into the Signal chat, Hegseth said, \"Nobody\u2019s texting war plans, and that\u2019s all I have to say.\" He then praised the bravery of the pilots who conducted the strikes.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and former national security officials said details of planned military operations have always been considered classified and argued it's hard to imagine why such plans would not be in this case.",
      "Republicans at the hearing steered away from the subject, with some saying they would ask for clarification in a closed session. But privately, some Republican lawmakers were angered by the episode and with Hegseth in particular.",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a retired Air Force general, scoffed at Hegseth\u2019s assertion that no war plans had been shared on the text chain.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s baloney,\u2019 Bacon told reporters. \u201cJust be honest and own up to it.\u201d",
      "More significantly, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he would investigate the text chain with his Democratic colleagues on the panel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about it and we\u2019ll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis,\u201d Wicker told reporters.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., downplayed the incident. She said adding Goldberg to the White House officials\u2019 Signal chat was \u201cincredibly sloppy\u201d but added that \u201cit was a mistake, and I am, I can say for certain, they\u2019re going to put protocols in place so that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Nine years ago,\u00a0Hegseth,\u00a0speaking on Fox News\u00a0on Election Day in 2016, harshly criticized\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.",
      "\u201cAny security professional, military, government, or otherwise, would be fired on the spot for this type of conduct and criminally prosecuted for being so reckless with this kind of information,\u201d he said.",
      "Questions about Gabbard\u2019s phone",
      "At the hearing Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers demanded answers about not only the leaked text chain but also whether Trump administration officials were regularly discussing sensitive national security topics on personal phones or commercial apps like Signal instead of secure government platforms.",
      "Gabbard declined to say whether she was using her private or her government phone for the leaked text exchanges on Signal, telling Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., that she would refrain from saying more pending a government review of the episode.",
      "Reed said he was puzzled by her answer.\u00a0\u201cWhat is under review? It\u2019s a very simple question: Were you using a private phone or officially issued phone? What could be under review?\u201d",
      "Gabbard replied,\u00a0\u201cThe National Security Council is reviewing all aspects of how this came to be, how the journalist was inadvertently added to the group chat and what occurred within that chat across the board.\u201d",
      "Cybersecurity experts say that government-issued phones are generally more secure and that a personal phone is likely to be more vulnerable to foreign intelligence hacking.\u00a0The use of Signal is generally not authorized for government communications devices, current and former officials told NBC News.",
      "But at the hearing, Ratcliffe said that the Signal app was installed on his office computer when he started as CIA director and that he was told it was \u201cpermissible\u201d to use it for government communications.",
      "Several days before The Atlantic revealed the chat, the National Security Agency issued a bulletin to some government employees about \u201ca vulnerability\u201d in the Signal messenger application.",
      "Russian hacking groups were using \u201cphishing\u201d attacks to try to penetrate the \u201clinked devices\u201d feature on Signal, the warning said.\u00a0The bulletin, obtained by NBC News, was relayed to elements of the Pentagon workforce and included steps to safeguard the Signal app.",
      "Signal said that it was inaccurate to say the application had a vulnerability and that hackers were using phishing scams to gain access to users\u2019 phones and then see their Signal messages.",
      "Earlier Hegseth remarks",
      "In January, after an army helicopter collided with a passenger jet in Washington, D.C., killing 67 people, Hegseth and Trump answered questions from reporters in the White House press room.",
      "Hegseth said the helicopter was performing a \"routine annual retraining of night flights on a standard corridor\" for a continuity of government mission.\" He was later told that he should not have publicly disclosed that it was a continuity of government mission, which involves U.S. officials and military forces practicing how the government would react in the event of an emergency, two sources told NBC News.",
      "The next month, Hegseth was criticized for deviating from prepared remarks in a major speech in Europe. Ahead of an address Hegseth was to deliver in Brussels on Feb. 12, some State Department officials advised Hegseth's team that he shouldn\u2019t publicly say Ukraine would not gain membership in NATO\u00a0as part of any peace deal with Russia, four administration and congressional officials told NBC News.",
      "In his speech, though, Hegseth departed from a draft prepared earlier in the day and delivered a blunter message about Ukraine\u2019s prospects for NATO membership than originally\u00a0written. \u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d he said.",
      "Hegseth's statement prompted criticism that the United States was ceding to a key Russian demand regarding Ukraine and NATO before negotiations with Moscow had even begun.",
      "The following day, Hegseth, who has said his comments were made in coordination with the rest of Trump\u2019s national security team,\u00a0tempered his language, saying \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in negotiations.",
      "Trump told reporters at the time that he hadn\u2019t asked Hegseth to walk back his remarks, but noted that Hegseth\u2019s tone had gotten \u201ca bit softer.\u201d Trump added that he thought Hegseth\u2019s\u00a0initial remarks \u201cwere pretty accurate,\u201d which fueled further confusion.",
      "After the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, a source close to the White House said that Trump was privately frustrated with \"Signalgate\" and wanted to see the story out of the headlines.",
      "Publicly, though, Trump defended his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who started the Signal chat and the officials who participated in it, saying there was no need for Waltz to apologize.",
      "But Trump's comments suggested that other members of his administration may be using Signal, as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll look into it,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut everybody else seems to be using it.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump is expected to announce new measures imposing tariffs on automobiles Wednesday afternoon.",
      "It was not immediately clear what the scope of the new duties would be. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that they may only end up affecting \"finished\" vehicles while leaving out auto parts. NBC News could not immediately verify that report.",
      "Shares in the U.S.' largest automakers initially fell on news of the announcement, which came directly from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, but rallied after the Journal published its report.",
      "Mexico remains the largest source of U.S. auto imports, accounting for approximately 14% of all cars purchased in the United States, followed by Japan, South Korea, the European Union and Canada.",
      "The announcement comes a week ahead of Trump's planned \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, when he has promised to roll out a bevy of new tariffs against many of America's largest trading partners, including long-time allies, that will affect a broad range of goods. Trump had hinted in recent days that a separate statement on auto tariffs could come ahead of next week.",
      "Previously, Trump indicated he was receptive to pleas from U.S. automakers that tariffs would harm their businesses. He gave them a one-month reprieve from duties on Canada and Mexico that ultimately evolved into indefinitely waiving the levies for all items covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement.",
      "Trump's on-again, off-again announcements have roiled markets in recent weeks while ratcheting up uncertainty in the economy. That has led to declining business and consumer confidence.",
      "While some economic indicators have suggested the American economy remains in solid shape, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that orders for business equipment placed with U.S. factories unexpectedly declined 0.3% last month, the first drop since October.",
      "Meanwhile, S&P Global reported this week that U.S. manufacturing activity slipped back into contraction territory, thanks to a rise in materials costs related to tariffs, while the outlook for the services sector deteriorated."

      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on Social Security, said he had not been told ahead of time about DOGE's moves at the agency.",

      "Social Security advocates and congressional Democrats decry the Musk-led changes to the agency as a backdoor move to curtail access to benefits. They cite Musk\u2019s antagonistic rhetoric, recently calling Social Security a \u201cPonzi scheme,\u201d as evidence of his intentions.",
      "\u201cFewer people will get benefits because of what they\u2019ve done. This is another way of killing Social Security, plain and simple,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThey can\u2019t outwardly cut benefits because it would be so unpopular.

      "Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. Called Duonychus tsogtbaatari, the dinosaur has two foot-long clawed fingers on each hand, one fewer than its fellow therizinosauria.",
      "Duonychus, which means two claws in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds, and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones, a long neck ending in a small head, and covered in down and quill-like feathers.",
      "\u201cIt kind of blew my mind,\u201d Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal\u00a0iScience and associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News. \u201cI felt this rush of excitement, like, \u2018Wait\u2026 am I actually looking at something completely new here?\u2019\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs were already the \u201cweirdest dinosaurs out there,\u201d Kobayashi said. \u201cDuonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It\u2019s like evolution said, \u2018Let\u2019s try something different,\u2019 and just ran with it.\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period,\u00a0145 million to 66 million years ago.Despite having only two claws, Duonychus was an \u201ceffective grasper\u201d that could reach branches or swaths of vegetation up to nearly 5 inches in diameter.",
      "\u201cDinosaurs weren\u2019t just stuck in one body plan \u2014 they were constantly experimenting, evolving, doing weird stuff,\u201d Kobayashi added, calling them \u201ctotal oddballs.\u201d",
      "Darla Zelenitsky, study co-author and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada, described Duonychus' claws as \u201csharp and huge,\u201d about one foot long.",
      "Duonychus would have used their claws to grasp and pull vegetation to the mouth during feeding, Zelenitsky said in an email Wednesday, adding that claws could also have other functions like self-defense or grappling.",
      "Though therizinosaurs were part of the theropod group, which included meat-eaters like tyrannosaurus and spinosaurus, Duonychus mainly ate leaves from large shrubs and trees.",
      "The specimen was excavated in 2012 by researchers from the Mongolian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Paleontology\u00a0from the Gobi Desert\u2019s Bayanshiree Formation, which dates back 90 million years and is known for its exceptional diversity of therizinosaurs. The fossil was a partial skeleton without a skull and legs, but the hands were \u201cexceptionally preserved,\u201d according to the study. The Duonychus individual was not fully mature.",
      "It\u2019s a \u201cgreat new discovery, and the two claws is interesting,\u201d said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate\u00a0palaeontology at the University of\u00a0Bristol in the U.K., who was not involved in the study.",
      "Dinosaurs used to have five fingers, just like human beings, but they quickly lost two over time, with most dinosaurs having three fingers, Benton said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSo, to go down to two was unusual,\u201d he said.",
      "The number of digits doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to hooking and pulling, Benton said, adding that the third finger may have been an \u201cencumbrance\u201d due to its short length.",
      "Fossil records of therizinosauria are \u201cnotably abundant\u201d in Cretaceous deposits across eastern Asia, particularly in Mongolia and China, according to the study.",

      "Honey bee colonies in the U.S. are projected to decline by up to 70% in 2025, entomologists at Washington State University said on Tuesday.",
      "The university said in a press release that in the past decade, honey bee colony losses have averaged between 40 to 50% annually. But this year, a combination of nutrition deficiencies, mite infestations, viral diseases, and possible pesticide exposure during the previous pollinating season led to higher losses, according to the release.",
      "\"Losses have been increasing steadily,\" Priya Chakrabarti Basu, an assistant professor of pollinator health and apiculture at WSU, said in the press release. \"Pollination demands haven\u2019t gone down, so beekeepers face tremendous pressure to keep the same number of colonies to meet those needs.\"",
      "The implications could be huge.",
      "About 35% of the world\u2019s food depends on pollinators, according to the\u00a0National Institute of Food and Agriculture.",

      "\"I don\u2019t want to be a fear-monger, but this level of national loss could mean increased bankruptcies amongst beekeepers,\" Hopkins said. \"Growers of crops downstream from almonds may need to scramble if the beekeeper they\u2019ve relied on to pollinate their apple trees, for example, isn\u2019t in business anymore.\"",
      "Honeybees had a production value of nearly $350 million in 2023, according to the Department of Agriculture.",

    "story": [
      "A decade ago, the Salvation Army fired a talented young music director after discovering that he\u2019d sent graphic sexual messages to a child \u2014 only for another branch of the ministry to hire him a year later to lead youth camps in a different part of the country, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky.",
      "Those camps are where the music director, Joel Collier, met then-14-year-old Riley Neville in 2017. In the years that followed, she alleges that he sexually groomed and abused her, leading her to attempt suicide. The alleged abuse included sexually explicit text messages, requests to describe her naked body, fondling and, after she turned 18, \u201cnon-consensual intercourse\u201d and \u201cperverse, violent, and obscene sexual acts,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Neville and her family only learned years later that the Salvation Army\u2019s Eastern Territory, headquartered in New York, had in 2014 placed Collier on an internal registry of individuals reasonably suspected of child sex abuse, the lawsuit says. Officials overseeing the Salvation Army\u2019s Southern Territory, based in Atlanta, knew Collier had been flagged as a possible danger to children, but they removed him from the list and hired him anyway, according to the complaint.",
      "NBC News typically does not identify people who say they have been sexually abused, but Neville, who turns 23 this week, said she wanted her name included. She\u2019s seeking damages from the Salvation Army and its subsidiary branches, alleging negligence in hiring and failures in their duty to protect children.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re an organization whose fundamentals are caring for and serving the most vulnerable populations,\u201d Neville said in an interview. \u201cThey can\u2019t knowingly hire pedophiles and not be held accountable.\u201d",
      "Collier, now 35, is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit and no longer works for the Salvation Army. He has since moved to the United Kingdom, according to his website. In an email, Collier said he hadn\u2019t read the allegations \u201cbut I hope we\u2019re able to find a swift resolution to them.\u201d He didn\u2019t immediately respond after a reporter emailed a copy of the complaint. The Salvation Army didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages.",
      "The Salvation Army, a protestant church and international charitable organization best known for its Christmastime bell ringers and red kettles, operates hundreds of Christian community centers, rehab programs, thrift shops and youth camps across the U.S.",
      "As the former music director for the Salvation Army\u2019s Kentucky and Tennessee division, Collier was tasked with leading faith-based music programs in the region. This included attending and leading music camps, where he was expected to tend to the spiritual needs of children in his care, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Collier entered Neville\u2019s life in early 2017, during a period of loneliness and vulnerability following her family\u2019s move from Massachusetts to Tennessee. As a gifted pianist and cornet player, she found purpose and friendship in the Salvation Army\u2019s student music program led by Collier, she said.",
      "That summer, he accompanied her and other students to Texas for an intensive weeklong music camp hosted by the Salvation Army. Throughout the week, Collier shared memories from his childhood with Neville and the other children, including stories of how he \u201cengaged in various sexual endeavors\u201d without his parents, bosses, or pastors finding out, according to the lawsuit.",
      "After the camp ended, Collier texted Neville constantly, the complaint said, with the messages growing more sexual over time. He asked Neville how and whether she shaved her genital area, sharing his own preference for sexual partners to \u201cgroom themselves,\u201d according to the lawsuit.

      "After a University of Washington lab technician and green card holder was recently detained by\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, her family is speaking out.",
      "Lewelyn Dixon, 64, who\u2019s had legal permanent status in the U.S. for 50 years, was arrested at the airport in Seattle and placed into ICE custody after coming back from a trip to her native Philippines in late February. She has a hearing scheduled for July, but her loved ones are calling for her release, telling NBC News that she is the glue that holds the family together.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s always been our go-to,\u201d said Dixon\u2019s niece Lani Madriaga, who described her as a mother figure. \u201cShe\u2019s always been that.\u201d",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Dixon is being held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington, Madriaga said, where she\u2019s been socializing with the other detainees, translating and helping them communicate with their attorneys amid the wait before her hearing.",
      "Dixon\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Osorio, said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection likely spotted a decades-old embezzlement conviction on her record upon her return, which prompted the detention. Dixon, who pleaded guilty to the nonviolent offense in 2000, was ordered to pay restitution and spend 30 days in a halfway house, court documents show. In 2019, she finished paying restitution.",
      "Dixon had been a vault teller and operations supervisor at Washington Mutual Bank, where she \u201cremoved cash from the vault on eight separate occasions\u201d without the bank\u2019s authorization, according to her plea agreement. In total, she removed $6,460.",
      "Dixon never told the family about the conviction, Madriaga said, who called it her aunt\u2019s \u201cdarkest secret.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t traveled, it wouldn\u2019t have triggered this,\u201d Osorio said.",
      "And though Dixon has also long been eligible for U.S. citizenship, Osorio said, she promised her father that she would keep her Filipino status so that she could retain property and land back in the Philippines.",
      "\u201cShe probably did not understand the risk,\u201d Osorio said. \u201cOtherwise, she probably would have \u2026 naturalized before she traveled.\u201d",
      "Dixon came to the U.S. when she was 14, immediately helping Madriaga and her siblings, who are also immigrants, settle into life in their new country.",
      "\u201cWe stayed together. We slept in the same room. We had a bunk bed and an extra bed, and we stayed in that room during our school years,\u201d Madriaga, 59, said. \u201cShe was very independent, and she was a good role model, making sure to have hard earned work.\u201d",
      "Later on, when Madriaga\u2019s sister went through a divorce, becoming a single mom, Dixon moved to Washington state so she could be there for the children and to pitch in with rent. Madriaga went through her own divorce years later and said Dixon was also there to help with the kids.",
      "\u201cThat was hard. She made sure she took care of my youngest one, because she was still a minor,\u201d Madriaga said. \u201cShe\u2019s like a second mom to her.\u201d",
      "At the lab, Dixon is a dedicated worker, Madriaga said. She had even scheduled herself to work a shift the night she was to get off the flight, she added. Dixon was on the cusp of her 10-year anniversary at work, during which her pension would vest. Her family members are now worried she\u2019ll lose both her job and her pension after being away for so long.",
      "Susan Gregg, a spokesperson at UW Medicine, would not elaborate on Dixon\u2019s case, but said that she had worked as a lab technician at the hospital since 2015.",
      "\u201cUW Medicine is dedicated to the well-being of all employees and hopes Lewelyn receives due process in a timely manner,\u201d Gregg said.",
      "Madriaga said that the family is speaking out for their aunt and also hoping to help others protect themselves from a similar fate.",
      "\u201cTo the people who avoided becoming a citizen like my aunt, who thought that she was protected: No. Go get your citizenship,\u201d Madriaga said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans are warming to the idea of including a debt ceiling increase in their big party-line bill to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has told Republican senators that he\u2019s now open to raising the debt limit in a broader spending package, according to a source familiar with his conversations. That\u2019s a shift for Thune in the direction of a budget blueprint adopted by House Republicans, which included a $4 trillion debt limit hike.",
      "The Senate's separate budget plan, by contrast, avoided the issue,  one of several major conflicts between the two measures to provide funding for Trump's policy priorities. But now, as the Trump administration pushes the chambers to resolve their differences, some Republican senators are changing their tune after initially preferring to address the debt limit question separately.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m warming up to it, as well,\u201d Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., told NBC News about a debt limit increase in the bill.",
      "Young said he wants a fiscal commission or some \u201cactionable plan\u201d to tackle the long-term solvency problems of Medicare and Social Security, saying it\u2019d be \u201cunconscionable\u201d to go through the budget process \u201cand not commit to revolving them.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., said he could \u201cpossibly\u201d vote for a debt limit hike in the bill, but he wants spending cuts alongside it.",
      "Thune also told members that he favors a compromise budget resolution with the House that could be voted on during the week of April 7, another significant concession after GOP senators had indicated earlier that the two chambers would pass separate bills and negotiate later.",
      "Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he's working on a new budget resolution that he will take straight to the floor without holding a hearing. And Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said the vote in the full Senate may happen as early as next week.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to resolve the differences between the $340 billion Senate budget blueprint, which tackles immigration, military and energy policy, and the House's plan, which includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts in addition to addressing those issues.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent held a meeting Tuesday with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the chairs of the two tax-writing committees, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo.",
      "After the meeting, Thune told reporters that there is \u201cconsensus forming around\u201d the idea of adding a debt limit hike to the bill, saying it is \u201cclearly a preferable outcome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a very constructive, productive conversation, and kind of honed in on the final issues that we have to decide,\u201d he said.",
      "In a new report\u00a0released Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the deadline for lawmakers to act on the debt ceiling or risk default on U.S. obligations will likely be in August or September.",
      "\u201cCBO estimates that if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government\u2019s ability to borrow using established \u2018extraordinary measures\u2019 will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\u201d the report said, while cautioning that the \u201cX date\u201d could be as early as May or June, depending on tax collections and outlays.",
      "The official deadline will be set by the Treasury Department.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he\u2019s willing to accept the House\u2019s $4 trillion hike in the bill but wants spending cuts attached to it. And he said a deadline could help pressure Congress to act.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t do things without a deadline,\u201d he said.",
      "If Republican congressional leaders attempted to pass a debt ceiling increase in a separate bill, they would need Democratic support to cross the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. By attempting to include it in the so-called \"reconciliation\" bill, they could pass it with simple majorities in the GOP-led House and Senate.",
      "But raising the debt ceiling with only Republican votes is easier said than done \u2014 particularly with a narrow House majority, which includes scores of lawmakers who have never voted to raise the borrowing limit. Conservative hard-liners say they\u2019re open to it \u2014 if Congress can cut spending to the tune of trillions of dollars.",
      "That is also proving to be a challenge. The House budget resolution requires the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut spending by $880 billion, but the CBO has said it\u2019s impossible to achieve that target without cutting Medicare or Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars. And some Republicans in swing districts have expressed reluctance about slashing Medicaid.",
      "After Tuesday's meeting, Crapo declined to say whether they discussed what to do about Medicare or Medicaid, telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about what goes on in my meetings.\u201d",
      "In addition, there\u2019s the question of how to make Trump\u2019s expiring tax cuts permanent, which would cost an estimated $4.6 trillion over a decade. Senate budget rules require Congress to pay for the tax cuts in order to make them permanent, but Republicans have no hope of finding savings at that level. So, instead, they\u2019re eying a new accounting technique to set the cost of extending those tax breaks at zero dollars, a move that Democrats insist they will fight.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky situation for Republicans, because they won\u2019t know if that new accounting method will be allowed until they vote to adopt a new budget that uses it. The Senate parliamentarian, the in-house referee who settles disputes within the budget process, will have to rule on it.",
      "\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t gonna happen until you have a bill,\u201d Graham said. \u201cShe can\u2019t rule on a hypothetical case, right? So we\u2019re gonna have to get the bill moving, the resolution, and then she\u2019ll tell us.\u201d",
      "Bessent said that solidifying Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts is a priority.",
      "\u201cThe American people gave this Administration a clear mandate to restore our nation\u2019s prosperity\u2014lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and a stronger economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am dedicated to working with Congress in making permanent President Trump\u2019s historic tax cuts and reviving the American dream. Today\u2019s productive meeting gives me confidence that a swift timeframe is achievable.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A decade ago, the Salvation Army fired a talented young music director after discovering that he\u2019d sent graphic sexual messages to a child \u2014 only for another branch of the ministry to hire him a year later to lead youth camps in a different part of the country, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky.",
      "Those camps are where the music director, Joel Collier, met then-14-year-old Riley Neville in 2017. In the years that followed, she alleges that he sexually groomed and abused her, leading her to attempt suicide. The alleged abuse included sexually explicit text messages, requests to describe her naked body, fondling and, after she turned 18, \u201cnon-consensual intercourse\u201d and \u201cperverse, violent, and obscene sexual acts,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Neville and her family only learned years later that the Salvation Army\u2019s Eastern Territory, headquartered in New York, had in 2014 placed Collier on an internal registry of individuals reasonably suspected of child sex abuse, the lawsuit says. Officials overseeing the Salvation Army\u2019s Southern Territory, based in Atlanta, knew Collier had been flagged as a possible danger to children, but they removed him from the list and hired him anyway, according to the complaint.",
      "NBC News typically does not identify people who say they have been sexually abused, but Neville, who turns 23 this week, said she wanted her name included. She\u2019s seeking damages from the Salvation Army and its subsidiary branches, alleging negligence in hiring and failures in their duty to protect children.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re an organization whose fundamentals are caring for and serving the most vulnerable populations,\u201d Neville said in an interview. \u201cThey can\u2019t knowingly hire pedophiles and not be held accountable.\u201d",
      "Collier, now 35, is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit and no longer works for the Salvation Army. He has since moved to the United Kingdom, according to his website. In an email, Collier said he hadn\u2019t read the allegations \u201cbut I hope we\u2019re able to find a swift resolution to them.\u201d He didn\u2019t immediately respond after a reporter emailed a copy of the complaint. The Salvation Army didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages.",
      "The Salvation Army, a protestant church and international charitable organization best known for its Christmastime bell ringers and red kettles, operates hundreds of Christian community centers, rehab programs, thrift shops and youth camps across the U.S.",
      "As the former music director for the Salvation Army\u2019s Kentucky and Tennessee division, Collier was tasked with leading faith-based music programs in the region. This included attending and leading music camps, where he was expected to tend to the spiritual needs of children in his care, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Collier entered Neville\u2019s life in early 2017, during a period of loneliness and vulnerability following her family\u2019s move from Massachusetts to Tennessee. As a gifted pianist and cornet player, she found purpose and friendship in the Salvation Army\u2019s student music program led by Collier, she said.",
      "That summer, he accompanied her and other students to Texas for an intensive weeklong music camp hosted by the Salvation Army. Throughout the week, Collier shared memories from his childhood with Neville and the other children, including stories of how he \u201cengaged in various sexual endeavors\u201d without his parents, bosses, or pastors finding out, according to the lawsuit.",
      "After the camp ended, Collier texted Neville constantly, the complaint said, with the messages growing more sexual over time. He asked Neville how and whether she shaved her genital area, sharing his own preference for sexual partners to \u201cgroom themselves,\u201d according to the lawsuit. He encouraged Neville to share her insecurities and updates on daily life, offering her \u201cspecial treatment\u201d at music camps while simultaneously working to gain the trust of her mother, the lawsuit said."

      "Mexico remains the largest source of U.S. auto imports, accounting for approximately 14% of all cars purchased in the United States, followed by Japan, South Korea, the European Union and Canada.",

Trump had hinted in recent days that a separate statement on auto tariffs could come ahead of next week.",
      "Previously, Trump indicated he was receptive to pleas from U.S. automakers that tariffs would harm their businesses. He gave them a one-month reprieve from duties on Canada and Mexico that ultimately evolved into indefinitely waiving the levies for all items covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement.",
      "Trump's on-again, off-again announcements have roiled markets in recent weeks while ratcheting up uncertainty in the economy. That has led to declining business and consumer confidence.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to hand over multiple sets of vaccine safety data to a discredited researcher with a history of spreading misinformation that vaccines cause autism, according to two sources familiar with the plan. Both learned about the matter during recent meetings at the CDC but were not authorized to speak about it publicly.",
      "David Geier, who shows up in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 directory as a \u201csenior data analyst,\u201d will reportedly analyze the data. Geier has repeatedly claimed that vaccines cause autism \u2014 a link that\u2019s already been fully debunked.",
      "\u201cIf this individual is involved, then it draws into immediate question the validity of any analysis that comes out of this work,\u201d said a former CDC official who was told of the plan before recently leaving the agency.",
      "Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting CDC director, called Geier a \u201cdeeply irresponsible choice\u201d to lead this effort as he has \u201cno medical degree and a long history of pushing discredited theories about vaccines and autism.\u201d",
      "\u201cFamilies affected by autism deserve credible research efforts that explore legitimate potential preventable causes of and treatments for autism,\u201d Besser said in a statement. \u201cThey are not helped when our tax dollars and research funds are wasted on rehashing a question that has already been answered.\u201d",
      "Geier\u2019s hiring was first reported Tuesday evening by The Washington Post. It was unclear Wednesday whether the plans had since changed. Neither HHS nor Geier responded to requests for comment.",
      "It comes as a growing measles outbreak is spreading in at least three states: Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. As of Wednesday, 377 cases had been confirmed in those states \u2014 the vast majority in unvaccinated children in Texas. It\u2019s the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019. Two people have died, including a 6-year-old girl.",
      "Earlier this month, it was reported that the CDC would launch a new investigation looking at possible links between vaccines and autism. Instead, the Department of Health and Human Services, led by longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., requested raw data from the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink and three other sources. The CDC is part of HHS.",
      "David Geier and his father, Maryland geneticist Dr. Mark Geier, were a pair of researchers known for their poorly designed and retracted studies using government safety data that have long-fueled widespread misinformation about vaccines.",
      "According to an account in the 2005 book \u201cEvidence of Harm,\u201d then-congressman Dave Weldon \u2014 whose nomination for CDC director was abruptly withdrawn two weeks ago \u2014 intervened to help the Geiers access the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC-housed dataset containing patient health records. This raw data is available to researchers, but isn\u2019t public because of concerns over privacy, misrepresentation of data, and manpower.",
      "The Geiers claimed at an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004 that the CDC data showed vaccines were linked to autism, a claim that was refuted by scientists at the meeting and in scores of published studies since. At the same IOM meeting, a scientist explained how the Geiers\u2019 findings had failed to factor for age \u2014 children with more vaccines only appeared to have higher rates of autism because they were older and had more time to be diagnosed. (Children on average are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around age 5.)",
      "The Geiers conducted research from a makeshift laboratory in their carpeted wood-paneled suburban Maryland basement; published several studies, many of which were retracted; and promoted an unproven treatment for autism that cost families tens of thousands of dollars and included injections of Lupron, a drug used for prostate cancer and early puberty. In children, it\u2019s only approved for precocious puberty and comes with side effects including bone damage, heart issues and seizures. They diagnosed kids with precocious puberty without proper tests and misled parents into thinking they were signing up for an approved autism therapy.

    "story": [
      "Latin America has been the cradle of\u00a0now globally popular literary and\u00a0musical genres, staple foods like the potato and\u00a0the inspiration behind the well-known Happy Meal.  It could also become the cradle of a new form of AI.",
      "A coalition of research institutions is working on what they call\u00a0LatAmGPT \u2014  a tool that can take into account the region's language variances, cultural experiences and \u201cidiosyncrasies.\u201d",
      "The aim is to offer users a more faithful peek into and representation of the Americas and the Caribbean than that of large language models (LLMs) that have mostly come from U.S. or\u00a0Chinese\u00a0companies and were largely trained in English.",
      "\u201cWe want to develop our capabilities, find local AI-based solutions and create a better understanding of these tools in Latin America and about Latin America,\u201d said Rodrigo Dur\u00e1n Rojas, director of Chile\u2019s National Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is coordinating the effort.",
      "Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that for general purposes, the project will be hard pressed to compete with \u201cstate of the art models with multimillion budgets,\u201d but that \u201cwhat our model can offer that others don\u2019t is a much richer and representative outlook of Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d its people and its outputs.",
      "For example, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said initial testing has shown LatAmGPT to have far better results when queried about South American history, and that the same is expected for when the LLM is asked to, say, write a poem in the style of local authors or provide an overview of regional education policy.",
      "There are more than 30 institutions involved in developing LatAmGPT from countries across the hemisphere, and collaborators include Latinos in the U.S. such as Freddy Vilches Meneses, an associate professor of Hispanic studies at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon. This,\u00a0he\u00a0said, is in recognition of how \u201cLatino and Latin American experiences are a cultural fellowship that goes beyond geography.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are elements of Latin America in Oregon, in California, in Texas,\" Vilches Meneses said. \"We want to make sure to incorporate that Latino experience as well.\u201d",
      "LatAmGPT, which aims to launch its first publicly available version around June, was announced last month\u00a0on the heels of\u00a0a\u00a0regional\u00a0commitment\u00a0made\u00a0during a\u00a0summit\u00a0on artificial intelligence in Uruguay to focus on \u201cethical, inclusive and beneficial\u201d technological development to \u201cpromote and protect human rights\u201d and explore the best possible public policies for AI governance.",
      "That impulse follows an increasing uptake in the region of technological advances such as the use of drones to monitor deforestation\u00a0in the Amazon rainforest, the development of apps to encourage more people to continue learning\u00a0Indigenous languages, the creation of\u00a0algorithms\u00a0to aid in the search for\u00a0forcibly disappeared\u00a0people or the adoption of\u00a0blockchain mechanisms to preserve historical documents of past dictatorship's actions.",
      "Some of those preserved documents are now being used as sources to train LatAmGPT, along with papers, records and logs that institutions such as libraries and national archives have made available specifically for the project. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said this gives the model more nuance and localized breadth than the general internet data scraping other systems tend to use.",
      "\u201cLatAmGPT will have more context than the other model languages and should therefore hallucinate far less\u201d when it comes to its use cases, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said. Hallucination is what AI researchers call when a model seemingly makes up an answer that's incorrect or\u00a0false though it's presented as factual.",
      "So far the project\u2019s dataset has more than 8 terabytes of information so the model can run on about 55 billion parameters (the variables with which an LLM makes a prediction output, like neurons that synapse or connect in a human brain). Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that\u2019s somewhat close to what the first public version of ChatGPT had when OpenAI launched it in the fall of 2022.",
      "The challenges of diverse dialects and complex grammar",
      "ChatGPT and other models like Google\u2019s Gemini have also sought in recent years to include a wider scope of data to offer the programs in languages other than English and with \u201clocalizations\u201d\u2014 such as the LLM knowing to respond in the metric system when relevant or to understand idioms.",
      "Those companies acknowledge the importance of expanding that offering. HyunJeong Choe, the director of engineering and internationalization for Google\u2019s Gemini Apps, said it\u2019s \u201ca dedicated experience\u201d that can be \u201cessential for cultural relevancy and sensitivity.\u201d",
      "But they also recognize it\u2019s a particularly complex endeavor, since most training data available to them is in English. \u201cThe intricacies of different languages can pose a significant obstacle for all AI models. ... Languages with complex grammar, diverse dialects or limited digital resources may be harder to train,\u201d Choe said.",
      "LatAmGPT,\u00a0through\u00a0its institutional networks\u00a0with libraries and archives, has somewhat skirted this issue \u2014 but not entirely. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said they\u2019re still struggling to incorporate Indigenous languages spoken by millions in the region because written documentation is not as widely available.",
      "But they're still aiming to try as they continuously perfect their model \u2014 though they stress the importance of collaboration.",
      "\u201cThe quality and attributes of the results we can get will depend on us as Latin Americans joining in to contribute as much as we can,\u201d said Vilches Meneses, the Lewis & Clark professor.",
      "Currently, with the tentative June launch date, LatAmGPT is still receiving data as collaborators regularly check in with specific questions to benchmark it in comparison to other available models.",
      "Among the questions they're testing are queries on the many different names and terms used in the region for a specific word like \"car,\" or a request for the GPT to make a comparison chart of how the region's countries have responded to mass immigration from\u00a0places like Venezuela.",
      "A large goal of LatAmGPT is to become familiar with these technological advances so they can be included in public policies and regulations, according to Dur\u00e1n Rojas.",
      "For that, the creation of the transcontinental network to help develop the project is key, and per Dur\u00e1n Rojas will likely remain so.",
      "\u201cThe most meaningful aspect, the greatest legacy, is this interconnectedness we\u2019ve found to strengthen and develop AI-based solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe model, I mean it\u2019s great that we\u2019re making it, but the collaboration \u2014 that\u2019s what will most impact how we build things going forward.\u201d",
      "And with that there is a growing opportunity to offer further contributions with a Latino touch.",
      "\u201cAt its base, this is jointly creating something from Latin America for Latin America and for the world, as proof to ourselves and to others that we can also produce high tech,\u201d Vilches Meneses said, \u201cand that we can contribute to knowledge of artificial intelligence while still employing our\u00a0social and cultural intelligence.\u201d",

Baldwin was rehearsing a scene on Oct. 21, 2021, at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe County,\u00a0New Mexico, when the prop gun he was holding fired a live round of ammunition. Hutchins was killed and Souza was wounded.",
      "The actor said in a 2021 interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos\u00a0that he did not pull the trigger and was told that the gun was empty.",

      "Kari Morrissey, the special prosecutor in the case,\u00a0denied that ammunition was kept from Baldwin's lawyer and said it was not connected to the case.",
      "Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and not guilty of tampering with evidence in March 2024. Prosecutors said she \"was negligent, she was careless, she was thoughtless\" on set. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison."

      "In \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d DeNiro plays not one, but two infamous mobsters: Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, a pair of mafia leaders who grew to power in tandem and became practically destined rivals in the New York City crime scene.",
      "Written by Nicholas Pileggi, author of \u201cWiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family,\u201d the book that inspired the mafia and crime drama standard \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d this Barry Levinson-directed film (director of \u201cRain Man\u201d) is a heavily detailed historical telling of the relationship between Costello and Genovese, including a power struggle and an attempted killing that leave the once close-knit ties between the two mob bosses strained.",
      "Costello, referred to as \u201cking of the rackets\u201d in the film, preferred to do most of his work from behind the scenes. On the other hand, DeNiro\u2019s other role as the Naples-born Vito Genovese is ambitious, power-hungry and in search of being the \u201cboss of bosses\u201d of the mafia, using aggressive tactics to gain power.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d follows the two mafia bosses\u2019 effective rivalry created when Genovese arrives home from Naples after World War II in search of Costello\u2019s position as head boss.",
      "Keep reading for an in-depth look at the depiction of crime bosses Frank Costello and Vito Genovese.",
      "Who were Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?",
      "Vito Genovese and Frank Costello both came to the New York after being born in Italy, then became involved in organized crime.",
      "Vito Genovese was 15 years old when he arrived in New York City from Naples, Italy. His first brush with the law came when he was 19, according to \u201cThe Deadly Don: Vito Genovese\u201d by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anthony M. DeStefano. By the time he was in his 60s, per 1958 letter to the FBI director included in a FOIA request document, he was \u201cwithout a doubt one of the most notorious of the country\u2019s hoodlums.\u201d",
      "Originally named Francesco Castiglia and born in Calabria in 1891, Frank Costello came to Manhattan as a child in 1895. According to the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, Costello became a member of the Five Points Gang in Manhattan and was jailed for at least four times for assault, robbery and at least four counts of weapons possession between 1908 and 1918.",
      "Costello then became a well-known bootlegger during the Prohibition era. Working alongside other well-known criminals \u2014 most importantly the infamous Charles \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano \u2014 he was associated with Joe Masseria\u2019s bootlegging organization among other ventures throughout the 1920s, per the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement.",
      "In 1931, Luciano established and led the \u201cCommission,\u201d a union of the five most powerful families in the criminal underworld, in the aftermath of the bloody Castellammarese War. Genovese became his underboss, with Costello serving as Genovese\u2019s consigliere.",
      "What was their relationship like?",
      "In \u201cThe Deadly Don: Vito Genovese,\u201d DeStefano lays out Costello and Genovese\u2019s tense relationship and how it came to be that way.",
      "According to DeStefano, the rivalry began when Luciano received a prison sentence for up to 50 years for compulsory prostitution in 1936, and gave the reigns to Costello instead of Genovese.",
      "The book describes Costello as a \u201cmobster-diplomat whose entrenchment with the Democratic party, conciliatory manner, and legitimate interests\u201d made him a good choice for the role. \u201cSo long as Costello was around, Genovese had a sense of inferiority,\u201d the book reads.",
      "But Genovese wasn\u2019t around for long. In 1937, the year after he was naturalized an American citizen, Genovese fled New York because he was named a suspect in the 1934 murder of Ferdinand Boccia.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d picks up in 1945 when Genovese arrived back in New York from Italy, after being indicted in the murder. He was later acquitted due to a lack of evidence from a corroborating witness, the New York Times wrote at the time.",
      "The movie follows Genovese back in New York getting his bearings and working with Costello to get back on the street. Then, Costello got sent away: He was convicted of obstructed and lying to Congress and served 18 months.",
      "While Costello was in prison, Genovese became the top acting boss of the Luciano family",
      "Genovese attempted to maintain control of the Commission even after Costello left prison. He ordered a hit on Costello outside his Central Park West apartment building in 1957.",
      "\"The shooting of Costello only grazed his head, and the old crime boss fully recovered. But Costello got the message, and in a truce with Genovese, he agreed to 'retire' from the mob, leaving leadership of the family in Genovese's hands,\" DeStefano writes.",
      "What happened to Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?",
      "Later in 1957, Genovese and other mafia bosses gathered in the Apalachin, New York home of Joseph Barbara.",
      "According to DeStefano's book, the purpose of the meeting was for Genovese to anoint himself \"as boss of the family.\" Other business included the murder of mafia boss Albert Anastasia, which occurred earlier that year.",
      "Law enforcement broke up the meeting and took over 60 attendees in for questioning. Charges were later dropped, but the meeting \"backfired badly\" for the mobsters, according to DeStefano's book. The meeting also forced FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to acknowledge the mafia publicly for the first time, changing the course of organized crime history.",
      "Genovese later received a 15-year prison sentence for narcotics trafficking and died in prison in 1969.",
      "Costello died of a heart attack at age 82 after living a life out of the public. Costello\u2019s obituary mentioned his interest for gardening in his Long Island home during his life out of the mafia, referenced in the conclusion of the film."

      "In \u201cThe Dream Hotel\u201d universe, officials use dream-monitoring data to predict whether someone could pose a threat to society. Sara's dreams are enough of a threat to land her at a retention center with other \u201cdreamers,\u201d all of whom are trying to prove their innocence.",
      "Lalami\u2019s latest novel is not only a commentary on today\u2019s heightened surveillance, but also the role that technology plays in an increasingly distrusting world.",

      "\"The Trial\"",
      "Franz Kafka's famous novel \u201cThe Trial\u201d is the unsettling tale of a respectable bank officer, Josef K., who is suddenly arrested for a charge that he must defend himself against with no information.",
      "\u201cWe follow K on a harrowing journey through a legal bureaucracy that surveils and punishes him without ever telling him why he is being imprisoned,\u201d Lalami told TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThis book begins with one of my favorite first lines: \u2019Someone must have been telling lies about Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one fine morning.\u2019\u201d",
      "\"The Memory Police\"",
      "Taking place on an unnamed island, \u201cThe Memory Police\u201d follows the eerie disappearance of various everyday objects \u2014 and how people have been made to forget them altogether.",
      "The novel details \u201ca writer who discovers that someone close to her actually remembers the forbidden words,\u201d Lalami explained.",
      "\u201cOgawa explores life under authoritarian systems, the ethical choices that people have to make, and the vital role that language and storytelling play in our survival.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe all get emotionally lost and psychologically lost on a daily or yearly basis,\u201d Gaige says. \u201cI felt that I quickly accessed my knowledge of emotional lostness and gave it to my hiker and was able to imagine and research the rest in terms of what she might do.\u201d",

      "About 3 million people visit the trail each year, but only 4,000 attempt to hike the entirety of it, like Valerie does.",
      "To research the book, Gaige did indeed visit the Appalachian Trail and spend an overnight at a \u201cshelter,\u201d or a stopping point on the road, with other hikers.",
      "\u201cThey could tell I was a fake. I was way too relaxed,\u201d she laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s such an intensity and a focus to the people that make it on the through the trail.\u201d",
      "Gaige was also struck by the story of Geraldine Largay, a retired nurse who disappeared from the trail in 2013. Her remains were found two years later, in 2015. Alongside her body were letters she had written to her family in her journal.",
      "\u201cThat was really the spark of the book \u2014 the letters. The book is all one letter to her mom,\u201d Gaige says.",
      "In addition to being a survival story, Gaige calls \u201cHeartwood\u201d her \u201cmother-daughter\u201d book because of how many mother-daughter dynamics it contains and explores. In contrast with Valerie and her beloved mother, Beverly and Lena both have complicated feelings they unfurl over the course of the novel.",
      "\u201cThe mother is really the most important figure outside oneself, it seems like, for the one\u2019s entire life. Sometimes it\u2019s because she was wonderful, and sometimes it was because she wasn\u2019t and did not give you the love you needed. And so you chase that for the rest of your life,\u201d she says.",
      "Reading the book, Gaige hopes readers ask themselves about times that they were lost and how they managed to find themselves.",
      "\"Have you ever been physically lost? How did it feel? Why is it so scary? When have you been emotionally or spiritually lost, and also, who rescued you? There's always somebody. Even in the darkest times, there's somebody who sees you, who steps in,\" she says.",

      "\"I totally do,\" she says. \"When have you ever gone out in nature and come home and regretted it?\"",

    "story": [
      "Maria Shriver still recalls the powerful words she told herself that allowed her to keep going after she learned her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, betrayed her by fathering a child outside of their 25-year marriage.",
      "The TODAY contributor writes about the heartbreak of going through a public divorce from the actor and former California governor in her new book of poems, \"I Am Maria.\"",
      "Shriver, 69, wrote in her new book's introduction about a moment after she learned Schwarzenegger had been involved in a sexual relationship with their housekeeper that produced a son, Joseph Baena, now 27.",
      "\"As I sat on the hotel room floor in the dark, terrified and alone with tears streaming down my face, I thought to myself: Maria, this doesn't have to be the end of the you. It can't be the end of you. Make it a new beginning of you,\" she wrote.",
      "Shriver discussed that moment with close friend Oprah Winfrey on the March 25 episode of the \u201cOprah\u201d podcast, saying, \"It\u2019s still an emotional thing for me, but I wanted to pick myself up. I wanted to be more open. I wanted to come out from behind whatever padded door I was living behind.",
      "\"I wanted to know how that had happened to me. I wanted to know who I could be moving forward,\" she continued. \"I wanted to show my daughters and my boys that I could hold myself up with my shoulders back, that I could heal.\"",
      "Shriver told Winfrey she really didn't \"know how to heal\" at the time, but was determined to do so both for her kids and for herself.",
      "\"I had just started going to therapy at the end of my marriage so I had not been someone who had been in therapy,\" she explained. \"I had not been someone who was on the healing path of life. And I went all in.\"",
      "Shriver, who put her broadcast journalism career on the back burner while Schwarzenegger was in office, recalled that until the couple's painful breakup, she was \"playing all the roles\" in life.",
      "\"I was being a daughter. I was being a journalist. I was being a mother,\" she said, adding, \"It's a lot. Everybody I talk to who's trying to raise kids, take care of parents, work themselves, be a good wife \u2014 you're not really thinking about a lot of other things.\"",
      "Winfrey recalled that in 2011, on the day the story about Schwarzenegger's affair went public in the media, Shriver, who had known about his betrayal for a while by that point, was scheduled to appear at a live taping for the last episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\"",
      "\"I have never seen a friend like you,\" said Winfrey. \"Because on the night that you knew that was going to be going public, you came and you showed up for me ... and I don't know how you did that. You weren't even in your right mind.\"",
      "Shriver responded, \"I wanted to be there for you because you had been there for me,\" adding that \"showing up\" for the people she loves is important to her.",
      "Shriver and Schwarzenegger tied the knot in 1986 after several years of dating. Shriver filed for\u00a0divorce in 2011 and the divorce was\u00a0finalized in 2021.",
      "The former couple share kids Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, 35,\u00a0Christina Schwarzenegger, 33,\u00a0Patrick Schwarzenegger, 31, and\u00a0Christopher Schwarzenegger, 27.",
      "During a May 2023 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the former governor called his divorce from Shriver \u201cmy failure.\u201d",
      "The action star noted it was a coincidence that he played a divorced CIA operative who was unfaithful to his wife in his new Netflix series \u201cFubar.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut in (my real-life marriage to Shriver), it was my f---up. It was my failure,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cAlso, in the show, he\u2019s deep down still in love with his wife.\u201d",
      "Schwarzenegger, who's been dating physical therapist Heather Milligan for more than a decade, added that he still loves Shriver. \"She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids,\" he said."

      "Ben Affleck has opened up about his divorce from Jennifer Lopez for the first time.",
      "Affleck spoke about the divorce in an interview with GQ published on March 25, when he was talking about how he presents himself to the public.",
      "\"My life is actually pretty drama-free,\" Affleck said. \"And so even if I have the same events that people have \u2014 I\u2019m sure in your mind you\u2019re thinking, Oh, well, you just got divorced. That\u2019s not drama-free.",
      "\"And I understand that instinct, but all of this is pretty adult, and for all the sensational stuff that gets written, if somebody sat down and talked to me about it, and I said, 'Well, this is really the experience,' their eyes would glaze over with boredom,\" he continued.",
      "The interviewer said he was thinking about Lopez's documentary \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" in which the premise was about the idea that Lopez and Affleck are private people but have public dimensions, and that Lopez was going to put more of herself and Affleck out there in the documentary.",
      "Affleck's response to the assertion was captured on camera, which the interviewer noted.",
      "\"Part of it was, 'Okay, if I\u2019m going to participate in this, I want to try to do it in an honest way and in a way that\u2019s interesting.' Because I thought it was an interesting examination,\" Affleck told GQ.",
      "\"Like I mentioned to you before, there are a lot of people who I think have handled celebrity more adeptly and more adroitly than I have, Jennifer among them,\" he continued. \"My temperament is to be a little bit more reserved and private than hers.\"",
      "Affleck said that he and his ex-wife didn't always have the same attitude toward fame.",
      "\"And so I thought, Oh, this is interesting because how do you reconcile that? Because exactly what you said is true. I love and support this person. I believe in them. They\u2019re great. I want people to see that,\" he said.",
      "Affleck referenced a line he said in the documentary: \"You don\u2019t marry a ship captain and then say, 'Well, I don\u2019t like going out in the water.'\"",
      "\"You\u2019ve got to own what you knew going into any relationship,\" he said. \"And I think it\u2019s important to say that wasn\u2019t the cause of some major fracture. It\u2019s not like you can watch that documentary and go, 'Oh, now I understand the issues that these two had.'\"",
      "Affleck and the interviewer met again a few days later, and Affleck brought up his comments about Lopez again when asked how he felt about the previous conversation.",
      "\"Well, on the one hand there\u2019s the first feeling, which is like, well, I hope I was clear about, when you asked me about Jen and the documentary and I talked about that and my sort of personal life a little bit, which I don\u2019t mind doing as long as my actual feelings and intentions and beliefs are communicated, which I hope I was clear that really this is somebody I have a lot of respect for,\" he said.",

I have nothing but respect.\"",
      "Affleck said there can be a tendency to look at a breakup and want to identify \"root causes.\"",
      "\"But honestly, like I said, the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting,\" he said.",
      "The interviewer asked to clarify that there wasn't one major thing that led to their breakup, which Affleck confirmed.",
      "\"Yeah, there\u2019s no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue,\" he said. \"The truth is, when you talk to somebody, 'Hey, what happened?' Well, there is no: 'This is what happened.' It\u2019s just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.",
      "\"And as you get older, this is true for me, I assume it\u2019s true for most people, there is no 'So-and-so did this' or 'This was the big event.' It\u2019s really, it sounds more like a couple\u2019s therapy session, which \u2014 you would tune out of someone else\u2019s couple\u2019s therapy after a while,\" he added. \"For one thing, you start going, 'Okay, clearly this person has got\u00a0these\u00a0issues. Clearly they have\u00a0these\u00a0issues.' And the reason I don\u2019t want to share that is just sort of embarrassing. It feels vulnerable.\"",

    "summary": "The deal for a maritime truce between Russia and Ukraine looks like a Kremlin wish-list and an example of Trump handing concessions to Putin, analysts warn.",
    "story": [
      "The American-brokered deal for a maritime ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine looks little more than a dream Kremlin wish-list and another example of President Donald Trump handing concessions to Vladimir Putin, some Western analysts warned Wednesday.",
      "An American delegation has been negotiating separately with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to fulfill Trump\u2019s promise to quickly end the fighting in Eastern Europe. On Tuesday, the White House said it had reached an agreement with both parties for a truce over the Black Sea, a strategic body of water bordering Ukraine, Russia and four other nations including Turkey, a major U.S. ally and NATO member.",
      "However, the terms of this tentative deal are enormously favorable for the Kremlin \u2014 with few upsides to Ukraine, according to many Russia-watchers in Europe and the United States.",
      "\u201cIt is unsurprising that the Americans have agreed to most, if not all, of Russia\u2019s demands\u201d because \u201cthe U.S. wants almost any deal,\u201d according to James Nixey, head of the Russia-Eurasia program at the London think-tank Chatham House. Washington \u201cis no longer an honest broker in these diplomatic negotiations,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause it clearly wishes to pursue the normalization of relations with Russia at the expense of Ukraine\u2019s demands, ambitions and desires.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for comment.",
      "The American delegation negotiated separately with the Ukrainian and Russian teams, with the White House releasing different statements afterward corresponding to each round of talks.",
      "Its statement relating to Ukraine said they had agreed to a ceasefire over the Black Sea while working toward halting attacks on energy infrastructure. That could stop the nightly fleets of Russian drones pummeling Ukraine\u2019s civilian power grid. But Ukrainian officials say it\u2019s more likely to benefit Russia by halting Kyiv\u2019s campaign of targeting oil refineries fueling the Kremlin\u2019s war.",
      "\u201cThese are really gifts to Russia,\u201d said Oleksii Tsymbalyuk, 50, a sergeant in the Ukrainian armed forces, referring to the terms of the proposed deal. He said it was \u201cdubious\u201d whether Russia would in fact stop bombing Ukraine\u2019s civilian power grid.",
      "Russia falsely claims that it has already been honoring an energy-grid ceasefire since March 18. Dmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Tuesday that this showed how \u201cMoscow is a city built on lies\u201d and that \u201cthe Russians are lying even when the truth is obvious.\u201d",
      "Arguably an even bigger concession came in the White House statement relating to Russia, saying it would \u201crestore Russia\u2019s access to the world market\u201d for agricultural and fertilizer exports.",
      "\u201cThis agreement would basically drive a coach and horses through the present sanctions regime,\u201d Phillips O\u2019Brien, an international relations professor at Scotland\u2019s University of St. Andrews, wrote on Substack. \u201cAny Russian company that claimed to be working in \u2018agricultural and fertilizer\u2019 products would be allowed to ship goods in and out of Russia.\u201d",
      "Russia would also benefit far more from the maritime ceasefire itself, many experts say, because it has suffered most from Ukraine drone attacks on its historically powerful Black Sea Fleet.",
      "\u201cAs predicted. Trump rushes to give Putin everything he wants for nothing,\u201d Russian chess champion turned democracy campaigner Garry Kasparov wrote on X. \u201cNothing for the U.S., nothing for Ukraine, everything for Russia, which is still bombing Ukrainian civilians every day.\u201d",
      "Western military experts say that Russia has less incentive to sign a ceasefire than Ukraine, after Moscow\u2019s recent gains on the battlefield\u00a0and its sense that now a more amenable president is in the White House.",
      "As has been the case with previous rounds of negotiations, there were indications that the White House and the Kremlin did not share the same understanding of the details of the deal. A Kremlin readout Tuesday suggested that a firm agreement had not yet been reached. It said that the Black Sea truce will go into force after a series of sanctions are lifted.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia was \u201csatisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing. This time, justice must prevail and we will continue our work with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump was asked whether Putin was playing for time, in an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt could be they\u2019re dragging their feet,\u201d Trump said, adding that he had \u201cdone it over the years\u201d when \u201cI don\u2019t want to sign a contract\u201d but \u201cI want to sort of stay in the game.\u201d Ultimately he said, \u201cI think Russia would like to see it end. And I think Zelenskyy would like to see it end at this point.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the ceasefire might come into force \u2014 if it\u2019s practically workable at all.",
      "The Kremlin readout said it would only begin once international banking restrictions were lifted and it was reconnected to the vital SWIFT global financial payments system. Trump told reporters Tuesday that his team \u201cwill be looking at\u201d these stipulations.",
      "But agreeing to lift these sanctions, imposed after Putin invaded Ukraine three years ago, would require the cooperation of Europe. Unlike Trump\u2019s warming ties, Europe has remained steadfastly opposed to Putin.",
      "That sets up a potential flashpoint between Washington \u2014 eager to push through this deal \u2014 and Europe \u2014 likely resistant to easing sanctions.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that Europeans don\u2019t fall for this U.S./Russian stitch-up, which will strengthen Russia, weaken Ukraine, and undermine the security of the rest of Europe,\u201d Ian Bond, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform think tank, wrote on the Blue Sky social media platform.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday evening that the ceasefire would begin immediately. But, he said, \u201cthere is no faith in the Russians\u201d to honor the agreement, and suggested he would ask Trump for additional weapons and sanctions if it was breached.",
      "\u201cWe do not trust them. And frankly, the world doesn\u2019t trust Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must prove that they are truly ready to end the war, ready to stop lying to the world, stop lying to President Trump and stop lying to America.\u201d"

      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",
      "\u201cLike most politics, this is mostly posturing.\u201d"

      "Latin America has been the cradle of\u00a0now globally popular literary and\u00a0musical genres, staple foods like the potato and\u00a0the inspiration behind the well-known Happy Meal.  It could also become the cradle of a new form of AI.",
      "A coalition of research institutions is working on what they call\u00a0LatAmGPT \u2014  a tool that can take into account the region's language variances, cultural experiences and \u201cidiosyncrasies.\u201d",
      "The aim is to offer users a more faithful peek into and representation of the Americas and the Caribbean than that of large language models (LLMs) that have mostly come from U.S. or\u00a0Chinese\u00a0companies and were largely trained in English.",
      "\u201cWe want to develop our capabilities, find local AI-based solutions and create a better understanding of these tools in Latin America and about Latin America,\u201d said Rodrigo Dur\u00e1n Rojas, director of Chile\u2019s National Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is coordinating the effort.",
      "Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that for general purposes, the project will be hard pressed to compete with \u201cstate of the art models with multimillion budgets,\u201d but that \u201cwhat our model can offer that others don\u2019t is a much richer and representative outlook of Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d its people and its outputs.",
      "For example, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said initial testing has shown LatAmGPT to have far better results when queried about South American history, and that the same is expected for when the LLM is asked to, say, write a poem in the style of local authors or provide an overview of regional education policy.",
      "There are more than 30 institutions involved in developing LatAmGPT from countries across the hemisphere, and collaborators include Latinos in the U.S. such as Freddy Vilches Meneses, an associate professor of Hispanic studies at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon. This,\u00a0he\u00a0said, is in recognition of how \u201cLatino and Latin American experiences are a cultural fellowship that goes beyond geography.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are elements of Latin America in Oregon, in California, in Texas,\" Vilches Meneses said. \"We want to make sure to incorporate that Latino experience as well.\u201d",
      "LatAmGPT, which aims to launch its first publicly available version around June, was announced last month\u00a0on the heels of\u00a0a\u00a0regional\u00a0commitment\u00a0made\u00a0during a\u00a0summit\u00a0on artificial intelligence in Uruguay to focus on \u201cethical, inclusive and beneficial\u201d technological development to \u201cpromote and protect human rights\u201d and explore the best possible public policies for AI governance.",
      "That impulse follows an increasing uptake in the region of technological advances such as the use of drones to monitor deforestation\u00a0in the Amazon rainforest, the development of apps to encourage more people to continue learning\u00a0Indigenous languages, the creation of\u00a0algorithms\u00a0to aid in the search for\u00a0forcibly disappeared\u00a0people or the adoption of\u00a0blockchain mechanisms to preserve historical documents of past dictatorship's actions.",
      "Some of those preserved documents are now being used as sources to train LatAmGPT, along with papers, records and logs that institutions such as libraries and national archives have made available specifically for the project. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said this gives the model more nuance and localized breadth than the general internet data scraping other systems tend to use.",
      "\u201cLatAmGPT will have more context than the other model languages and should therefore hallucinate far less\u201d when it comes to its use cases, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said. Hallucination is what AI researchers call when a model seemingly makes up an answer that's incorrect or\u00a0false though it's presented as factual.",
      "So far the project\u2019s dataset has more than 8 terabytes of information so the model can run on about 55 billion parameters (the variables with which an LLM makes a prediction output, like neurons that synapse or connect in a human brain). Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that\u2019s somewhat close to what the first public version of ChatGPT had when OpenAI launched it in the fall of 2022.",
      "The challenges of diverse dialects and complex grammar",
      "ChatGPT and other models like Google\u2019s Gemini have also sought in recent years to include a wider scope of data to offer the programs in languages other than English and with \u201clocalizations\u201d\u2014 such as the LLM knowing to respond in the metric system when relevant or to understand idioms.",
      "Those companies acknowledge the importance of expanding that offering. HyunJeong Choe, the director of engineering and internationalization for Google\u2019s Gemini Apps, said it\u2019s \u201ca dedicated experience\u201d that can be \u201cessential for cultural relevancy and sensitivity.\u201d",
      "But they also recognize it\u2019s a particularly complex endeavor, since most training data available to them is in English. \u201cThe intricacies of different languages can pose a significant obstacle for all AI models. ... Languages with complex grammar, diverse dialects or limited digital resources may be harder to train,\u201d Choe said.",
      "LatAmGPT,\u00a0through\u00a0its institutional networks\u00a0with libraries and archives, has somewhat skirted this issue \u2014 but not entirely. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said they\u2019re still struggling to incorporate Indigenous languages spoken by millions in the region because written documentation is not as widely available.",
      "But they're still aiming to try as they continuously perfect their model \u2014 though they stress the importance of collaboration.",
      "\u201cThe quality and attributes of the results we can get will depend on us as Latin Americans joining in to contribute as much as we can,\u201d said Vilches Meneses, the Lewis & Clark professor.",
      "Currently, with the tentative June launch date, LatAmGPT is still receiving data as collaborators regularly check in with specific questions to benchmark it in comparison to other available models.",
      "Among the questions they're testing are queries on the many different names and terms used in the region for a specific word like \"car,\" or a request for the GPT to make a comparison chart of how the region's countries have responded to mass immigration from\u00a0places like Venezuela.",
      "A large goal of LatAmGPT is to become familiar with these technological advances so they can be included in public policies and regulations, according to Dur\u00e1n Rojas.",
      "For that, the creation of the transcontinental network to help develop the project is key, and per Dur\u00e1n Rojas will likely remain so.",
      "\u201cThe most meaningful aspect, the greatest legacy, is this interconnectedness we\u2019ve found to strengthen and develop AI-based solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe model, I mean it\u2019s great that we\u2019re making it, but the collaboration \u2014 that\u2019s what will most impact how we build things going forward.\u201d",
      "And with that there is a growing opportunity to offer further contributions with a Latino touch.",
      "\u201cAt its base, this is jointly creating something from Latin America for Latin America and for the world, as proof to ourselves and to others that we can also produce high tech,\u201d Vilches Meneses said, \u201cand that we can contribute to knowledge of artificial intelligence while still employing our\u00a0social and cultural intelligence.\u201d",

      "Duonychus, which means two claws in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds, and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones, a long neck ending in a small head, and covered in down and quill-like feathers.",
      "\u201cIt kind of blew my mind,\u201d Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal\u00a0iScience and associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News. \u201cI felt this rush of excitement, like, \u2018Wait\u2026 am I actually looking at something completely new here?\u2019\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs were already the \u201cweirdest dinosaurs out there,\u201d Kobayashi said. \u201cDuonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It\u2019s like evolution said, \u2018Let\u2019s try something different,\u2019 and just ran with it.\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period,\u00a0145 million to 66 million years ago.Despite having only two claws, Duonychus was an \u201ceffective grasper\u201d that could reach branches or swaths of vegetation up to nearly 5 inches in diameter.",

      "Darla Zelenitsky, study co-author and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada, described Duonychus' claws as \u201csharp and huge,\u201d about one foot long.",

    "story": [
      "A network of companies operated by a secretive\u00a0Chinese tech firm\u00a0has been trying to recruit recently laid-off U.S. government workers, according to job ads and a researcher who uncovered the campaign.",
      "Max Lesser, a senior analyst on emerging threats with\u00a0the Washington-based think tank\u00a0Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said some companies placing recruitment ads were \u201cpart of a broader network of fake consulting and headhunting firms targeting former government\u00a0employees\u00a0and AI researchers.\u201d",
      "Little information is publicly available on the four consultancies and recruitment companies allegedly involved in the network, which in some cases shared overlapping websites, were hosted on the same server, or had other digital links, according to Reuters\u2019 reporting and Lesser\u2019s research.",
      "The four companies\u2019 websites\u00a0are hosted at the same IP address alongside Smiao Intelligence, an internet services company whose website became unavailable during Reuters\u2019 reporting. Reuters could not determine the nature of the relationship between Smiao Intelligence and the four companies.",
      "The news agency\u2019s attempts to track down the four companies\u00a0and Smiao Intelligence\u00a0ran into numerous dead ends including unanswered phone calls, phone numbers that no longer work, fake addresses, addresses that lead to empty fields, unanswered emails and deleted job listings from LinkedIn.",
      "Lesser, who uncovered the network\u00a0and shared his research with Reuters ahead of publication,\u00a0said the campaign follows \u201cwell-established\u201d techniques used by previous Chinese intelligence operations.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this activity significant,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the network seeks to exploit the financial vulnerabilities of former federal workers affected by recent mass layoffs.\u201d",
      "Reuters could not determine whether the companies are linked to the Chinese government or whether any former\u00a0federal\u00a0workers were recruited.",
      "Asked about the research, three intelligence analysts told Reuters that the network\u00a0appeared to be a\u00a0prime example of how foreign-linked entities are trying to gather intelligence from staff members fired or forced into retirement by President Donald Trump and billionaire tech tycoon Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Once employed by the network,\u00a0federal\u00a0employees\u00a0could then be asked to share increasingly sensitive information about government operations, or recommend additional people who might be targeted for willing or unwitting participation, the analysts said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington told Reuters in an email that\u00a0China\u00a0was unaware of any of the entities allegedly involved in the campaign and that Beijing respects data privacy and security.",
      "A White House spokesperson said\u00a0China\u00a0was constantly trying to exploit the United States\u2019 \u201cfree and open system\u201d through espionage and coercion.",
      "\u201cBoth active and former government\u00a0employees\u00a0must recognize the danger these governments pose and the importance of safeguarding government information,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "CNN reported\u00a0on Feb. 28 that U.S. intelligence believes Russia and\u00a0China\u00a0are targeting disgruntled U.S. government\u00a0employees, something both countries have done for years. The companies in the network \u2014 which posted job ads to Craigslist, LinkedIn and other job sites \u2014 could be concrete evidence that such operations are underway,\u00a0Lesser said.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0earlier this month that some U.S. government workers with top security clearances were not given standard exit briefings which, in part, cover what to do if approached by foreign adversaries."

    "summary": "South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The landmark report released Wednesday followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea\u2019s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and \u201980s.",
      "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government-appointed fact-finding panel, said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May.",
      "However, some adoptees and even a senior investigator on the commission criticized the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government\u2019s complicity.",
      "That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, a standing commissioner, also lamented the panel\u2019s decision-making committee\u2019s 5-4 vote on Tuesday to defer assessments of 42 other adoptees\u2019 cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission\u2019s conservative chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions.",
      "However, Lee implied that some committee members were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified \u2014 either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them.",
      "Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives.",
      "Lee said the commission\u2019s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I find yesterday\u2019s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,\u201d Lee said.",
      "After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children, including those born to poor parents or unwed mothers.",
      "Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea\u2019s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their possession and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in \u201clarge-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,\u201d the commission said.",
      "Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children\u2019s identities, according to the commission\u2019s report. It said the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees.",
      "The commission recommended that the South Korean government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States \u2014 the largest recipient of Korean children by far \u2014 and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions, which have drawn growing international attention amid criticism that thousands of children were carelessly or unnecessarily separated from their biological families. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the government department that handles adoption issues, did not immediately comment on the commission\u2019s report."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 The Unification Church in Japan was ordered dissolved by a court Tuesday after a government request spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "The South Korea-based church said it was considering an immediate appeal of the Tokyo District Court\u2019s revocation of its legal status, which would take away its tax-exempt privilege and require liquidation of its assets.",
      "The order followed a request by Japan\u2019s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.",
      "In the ruling, the court said the church\u2019s problems were extensive and continuous, and that a dissolution order was necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television.",
      "\u201cWe believe our claims were accepted,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding that the government would continue efforts to support victims of the church.",
      "The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers.",
      "The church called the court order regrettable and unjust and said in a statement that the court\u2019s decision was based on \u201ca wrong legal interpretation and absolutely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the church\u2019s Japanese branch, accused the government of \u201cfabricating damages.\u201d The church is \u201cnot a malicious group that should be dissolved,\u201d he told a news conference on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation into Abe\u2019s assassination revealed links over decades between the church and Japan\u2019s governing Liberal Democratic Party. The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in the 1960s during an anti-communist movement supported by Abe\u2019s grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.",
      "The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family\u2019s financial troubles.",
      "The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group subject to a revocation order based on violations of Japan\u2019s civil code. Two earlier cases involved criminal charges \u2014 the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.",
      "To seek the church\u2019s dissolution, the Education Ministry had submitted 5,000 documents and pieces of evidence to the court, based on interviews with more than 170 people.",
      "The church tried to steer its followers\u2019 decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability and causing fear and harm to them and their families, seriously deviating from the law on religious groups, officials and experts say.",
      "The Agency for Cultural Affairs said the settlements reached in or outside court exceeded 20 billion yen ($132 million) and involved more than 1,500 people.",
      "Lawyers representing those seeking damages from the church welcomed the court decision as a major first step toward redress.",
      "\u201cWe must pursue our effort to achieve redress and to prevent future problems,\u201d head lawyer Susumu Murakoshi told reporters, demanding that the church accept the dissolution order and offer an apology and compensation to all victims.",
      "The church was founded in Seoul in 1954 by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative, family-oriented value systems.",
      "Nicknamed the \u201cMoonies,\u201d after its founder, the church developed relations with conservative world leaders including President Donald Trump, as well as his predecessors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.",
      "The church faced accusations in the 1970s and 1980s of using devious recruitment tactics and brainwashing adherents into turning over huge portions of their salaries to Moon. In Japan, the group has faced lawsuits for offering \u201cspiritual merchandise\u201d that allegedly caused members to buy expensive art and jewelry or sell their real estate to raise donations for the church.",
      "The church has acknowledged excessive donations but says the problem has lessened since the group stepped up compliance in 2009.",
      "Experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and that the majority of the church\u2019s worldwide funding comes from Japan."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea\u2019s worst ever were ravaging the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Officials also said a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest-hit by the wildfires. The Korea Forest Service said rescue efforts were underway and it was presumed that the aircraft was operated by one pilot with no crew members.",
      "An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were among the structures destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres and injured 19 people, the government\u2019s emergency response center said.",
      "In a televised address, acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were causing worse damage than many other past wildfires.",
      "\u201cDamages are snowballing,\u201d Han said. \u201cThere are concerns that we\u2019ll have wildfire damages that we\u2019ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.\u201d",
      "Han said crews were struggling to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. Han said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday to extinguish the wildfires with the help of about 130 helicopters. He said that \u201ca small amount\u201d of 5-10 millimeters of rain was expected Thursday.",
      "Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea in terms of land burned.",
      "Officials in several southeastern cities and towns had ordered residents to evacuate Tuesday as firefighters struggled to contain multiple blazes fueled by dry winds. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan, according to South Korea\u2019s Interior Ministry.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, officials had said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed the blazes to spread again. Efforts to fight the fires were partially suspended overnight as the winds strengthened.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at Gounsa, a temple said to have been originally built in the 7th century. Among the destroyed structures were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d \u2014 a pavilion-shaped structure built on a stream in 1668 and a Joseon Dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",
      "The temple\u2019s other state-designated \u201ctreasure,\u201d a stone Buddha statue reportedly manufactured in the 8th century, was evacuated to a safe place, according to government and Buddhist officials.",
      "The Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.",
      "The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide Tuesday, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "The 18 dead include four firefighters and government workers who were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.",
      "Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work."

      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both downplayed the mishap at a contentious Senate Intelligence Committee hearing a day after The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a text thread about U.S. military plans to strike Houthi militias in Yemen.",
      "The incident has raised questions about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of classified information, as well as its use of the encrypted messaging application Signal and other electronic communications.",
      "In testimony, Ratcliffe acknowledged he was on the text chain but said it was \u201clawful.\u201d He said the Signal app was loaded on his work computer at the CIA when he started the job and claimed it was permitted as a communication tool for work purposes.",
      "He did not address whether it was appropriate to share detailed military plans on Signal.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Gabbard, asked by Democrats whether the timing and location of planned military strikes were shared on the chat, replied: \u201cI can attest to the fact that there were not classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group at any time.\u201d",
      "Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the magazine and a veteran national security journalist, reported that the thread on Signal appeared to include Ratcliffe and Gabbard, as well as Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "In a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Waltz said that he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for organizing the text group, and that a staffer was not to blame for Goldberg\u2019s inclusion.",
      "\u201cI take full responsibility. I built the \u2014\u00a0I built the group,\u201d Waltz told host Laura Ingraham. \u201cMy job is to make sure everything\u2019s coordinated.\u201d",
      "The military plan discussed in the group chat \u201cincluded precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing,\u201d Goldberg wrote in his article. He said he would refrain from reporting specific information shared in the chat that could damage national security.",
      "In an exchange with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Gabbard said she did not remember discussion of specific weapons, targets or timing.",
      "The intelligence officials both testified Tuesday that Hegseth was the \u201coriginal classifying authority\u201d on the chat. Goldberg reported that one message from a Signal account labeled \u201cPete Hegseth\u201d included \u201coperational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard, responding to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said they would cooperate with an \u201caudit\u201d looking into whether they had used Signal or another messaging platform to discuss classified information.",
      "In a statement Monday, the National Security Council said it was \u201creviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\u201d",
      "Gabbard would not answer questions about whether she was using her personal phone or her government-issued phone, citing the fact that the Signal issue was \u201cunder review.\u201d",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, one of the other witnesses Tuesday, said he was briefed on the incident Monday night and did not say whether he planned to open an investigation.",
      "The hearing frequently grew heated. Democrats asked aggressive questions and accused the witnesses of jeopardizing national security.",
      "Wyden said he believes Hegseth and Waltz should resign. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said it was \u201cmind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody even bothered to check\u201d whether a journalist or another unauthorized person was in the chat.",
      "In his opening statement, Warner had blasted the Trump administration for what he characterized as a \u201ccavalier attitude towards classified information,\u201d describing it as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201csloppy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Signal fiasco is not a one-off,\u201d Warner said. \u201cIt is, unfortunately, a pattern we\u2019re seeing too often repeated.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe unwillingness of the individuals on this panel who were on the chat to even apologize for acknowledging what a colossal screw-up this is speaks volumes,\u201d he added.",
      "Warner cited an earlier incident in January when the CIA, complying with a presidential executive order, sent an unclassified email to the Office of Personnel Management with the first names and initialized last names of recently hired employees at the spy agency.",

      "\u201cThis sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for him is entirely unacceptable. It\u2019s an embarrassment,\u201d Bennet said. He added: \u201cYou need to do better. You need to do better.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the chairman of the committee, did not directly address the Signal text chain in his prepared opening remarks. Republican senators largely focused their questions on other issues, including drug cartels and China.",

      "Coe told a news conference that athletes will have to take the test just once during their career.",

      "He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (differences in sex development) regulations. They have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and we\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to do it.\u201d"
