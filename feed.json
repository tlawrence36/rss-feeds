      "The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance at a music festival in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn\u2019t mean that expression should be free of consequences,\u201d Landau wrote on X. \u201cThe last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \u201cface monetary and criminal sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know that outrage is not enough,\u201d Lemus said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible to ban (the music).\u201d",
      "Since, a number of the band's future shows have been cancelled, one town's government saying that the show \u201cdidn't have the municipal permissions needed\u201d to carry out the performance.",
      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\u201d",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly cancelled, ticket sales websites read: \u201cNo tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \u201cnarco corridos\u201d, expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic pet reindeer beloved by many in Alaska's largest city has been euthanized, just weeks after someone tampered with his cage and possibly poisoned him, his caretaker said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer as to why he had to be put down other than it relates back to what happened,\u201d said Albert Whitehead, who cared not only for the 8-year-old reindeer named Star but also the decades-long tradition of having a reindeer in downtown Anchorage.",
      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen's gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star's pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",
      "Results won\u2019t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.",
      "There has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.",
      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

      "From France to Iceland to the United States, April Fools\u2019 Day is celebrated with practical jokes and elaborate hoaxes",
      "From France to Iceland to the United States, April Fools\u2019 Day will be celebrated on Tuesday with practical jokes and elaborate hoaxes, so make sure to triple check viral posts and don\u2019t leave your back open to any stray sticky notes.",
      "The jokesters' custom has been around for hundreds of years, although its exact birth is difficult to pinpoint. These days, depending on your location, it could be marked with a fish secretly pinned to someone's back or a whoopee cushion or even news reports of flying penguins (yes, that actually happened ).",
      "In the U.S., the pranks are typically followed by screams of \u201cApril Fools!\u201d to make sure all are aware that they were the unsuspecting recipient of a practical joke.",
      "Here are some thing to know about April Fools\u2019 Day and its history:",
      "There are plenty of theories about where this day of pranks and hoaxes came from. It's not clear exactly which one might be true. But what is clear is that April Fools\u2019 Day has roots stretching back hundreds of years.",
      "One idea is that it dates back to France in 1564, when King Charles IX moved the New Year celebration from its weeklong observance beginning March 25 to a celebration on Jan. 1, according to the Library of Congress. Those who forgot or were never told about the change were mocked. Although the library notes that the true history of the New Year is more complicated, as different parts of the country observed it on different days.",
      "A similar theory ties April Fools\u2019 Day to the 1582 change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, according to the library. But it explains that this type of origin story has been used to explain several holidays and may be more of a \u201cmigratory legend.\u201d",
      "And then there's the theory that it could be connected to the March 21 vernal equinox, which is known as a day when people are tricked by unexpected weather changes, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.",
      "Whatever its origin, the first time there was clear documented reference to the day was in 1561 when the Flemish writer Eduard De Dene wrote in his poem about a nobleman sending his servant on pointless tasks, according to the Library of Congress. The servant soon realizes that he has been \u201csent on \u2018fool\u2019s errands\u2019 because it\u2019s April 1,\u201d the library states.",
      "In 2021, then-first lady Jill Biden pretended to be a flight attendant on an airplane traveling from California to Washington. She wore a \u201cJasmine\u201d nametag and passed out Dove ice cream bars while wearing a black mask, black pantsuit and wig. A few minutes later, \u201cJasmine\u201d reemerged without the wig \u2014 revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d",
      "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin became known for announcing outlandish ideas every April Fools\u2019 Day soon after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a \u201cscratch and sniff\u201d feature on its search engine.",
      "In 1992, NPR 's \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program announced that former-President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974, would be running for president, according to the Museum of Hoaxes. A comedian had impersonated Nixon to say, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Outside of the U.S., one of the most notable pranks involved the BBC World Service in 1980 declaring that Big Ben would become a digital clock and renamed Digital Dave, according to the UK Parliament.",
      "From Scotland to Iceland to the U.S., the day is honored in a wide array of ways.",
      "In France, the day is known as poisson d\u2019avril, or \u201cApril Fish,\u201d and has long had a fish-themed pranking tradition. In modern times, it\u2019s become more of a day for children to relish in attaching paper fish to their friends\u2019 backs, Atlas Obscura says.",
      "In Scotland, April Fools' has a history of being a two-day event. April 1 is known as \u201cGowkie Day\u201d or \u201cHunt the Gowk,\u201d explained Encyclopedia Britannica. Gowk is a term used to describe a fool. On April 2, the celebration may become more physical, with children attaching \u201ckick me\u201d signs to people\u2019s backs.",
      "The day is also celebrated in Iceland, with the aim being to get people to \u201chlaupa apr\u00edl,\u201d or \u201cmake an April run.\u201d In other words, to trick someone in a way that makes them travel to a different location. News agencies have also been known to participate in pranking people. In 2014, for example, Iceland Review ran a story with the headline, \u201cGoogle Signs Deal with Iceland,\u201d saying the fake news was part of \u201ca long-standing tradition of the Icelandic media.\u201d",

      "After being shelved by Warner Bros. in 2023, the Looney Tunes film \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d has found a new home. Ketchup Entertainment announced Monday that it acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for an undisclosed sum.",
      "The deal gives new life to one of the three fully completed films that Warner Bros. elected to take a tax write-off on rather than release. The tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros. coming out of the pandemic, was widely disparaged by creatives and fans, alike.

      "LONDON -- The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence \u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media.",
      "Now they have the ear of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who welcomed the filmmakers to Downing Street on Monday for talks on child protection. Starmer's office said he backed an initiative by Netflix to stream the drama series for free to secondary schools across the country, so that as many children as possible can watch it.",
      "The show, filmed in England, explores the difficult questions that arise when a 13-year-old boy is accused of stabbing a girl in his school to death. It has been watched by more than 66 million people worldwide since it launched earlier in March.",
      "Starmer said it was difficult watching the series with his 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son. But showing it widely in schools will \u201chelp students better understand the impact of misogyny, dangers of online radicalization and the importance of healthy relationships,\u201d his office said.",

      "\u201cSo to have the opportunity to take this into schools is beyond our expectations,\u201d he said. \"We hope it\u2019ll lead to teachers talking to the students, but what we really hope is it\u2019ll lead to students talking amongst themselves.\u201d",

Tate and his brother, Tristan, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, face charges of human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group to sexually exploit women.",

      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",

      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",
      "He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- After mounting criticism following its initial response to the violent attack on Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences apologized Friday for not acknowledging Ballal by name.",
      "In a letter to academy members, academy CEO Bill Kramer and its president, Janet Yang, said they regretted not issuing a direct statement on Ballal. The director on Monday, witnesses said, was beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and then detained by the Israeli military.",
      "The attack, just weeks after Ballal and his fellow directors won best documentary at the Academy Awards, was widely condemned by numerous film organizations, among others. The academy on Wednesday released a statement condemning \u201charming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints.\"",
      "Yuval Abraham, a journalist and co-director of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d was highly critical of that response, comparing it to \u201csilence on Hamdan's assault.\"",
      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",

So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",

      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",

She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",

      "The entire 17-member U.S. government team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health received layoff notices Tuesday, as part of the overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "It's not clear whether there is an alternative plan to analyze the data, which local and state governments use to develop prevention measures and treatment services. The federal government distributes grant money to fight the opioid addiction crisis based on it. Researchers use it to study trends in depression, alcoholism and tobacco use.",
      "An HHS spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about the survey's future.",
      "The nationally representative survey is conducted in person by an independent research group with about 70,000 people each year. It provides a more complete picture than trends in overdose deaths, which capture only a small segment of the problem, said Lindsey Vuolo of the Partnership to End Addiction.",
      "\u201cWe use its findings on a near daily basis in our research, educational programming and resources, and communication materials,\u201d Vuolo said of the survey.",
      "Before the layoffs, the government team was preparing to analyze 2024 data, the first year where trends would be reliable again since the pandemic disrupted data collection, said Jennifer Hoenig, the laid-off director of the Office of Population Surveys.",
      "The data could now sit on the shelf without experienced analysts to untangle it, she said.",
      "\u201cEvery person working on it was let go,\u201d Hoenig said, noting that the data collection is mandated by Congress. The office is part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which would be absorbed into a new Administration for a Healthy America under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan.",
      "\u201cMy team and I care so much about this data that we want people to understand what is being lost in our country if we don\u2019t have it,\u201d Hoenig said.",
      "In recent years, the survey has found:",
      "\u2014 Seven out of 10 adolescents did not use illicit drugs or drink alcohol in 2023.",
      "\u2014 Men 60 and older were more likely than women in the same age group to have a substance use disorder, but women were more likely than men to have had a major depressive episode in 2021 and 2022.",
      "\u2014 Lesbian, gay and bisexual young people were about twice as likely as straight young people to have had a substance use disorder in 2023.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Susan Crawford\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election victory over a conservative candidate backed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk cemented a liberal majority on the state\u2019s top court for at least three more years and dealt a devastating blow to Republicans who fear it paves the way for a wide array of rulings that will overturn or block the GOP's agenda in the swing state.",

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",

      "A groundbreaking initiative could soon be bringing surgeons closer to patients in Africa's remote corners where the doctor-to-patients ratio is among the lowest in the world",
      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",
      "Aseku was preparing for yet another medical trip until late February when he joined others in the first trial of 3D telemedicine technology in Ghana powered through computer screens in the back of a van.",
      "Those behind the initiative, developed by Microsoft\u2019s research team in partnership with local doctors and researchers, say the remote assessment will help provide medical consultations for patients awaiting surgery or after an operation, in a region where the doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the world.",
      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",
      "\u201cWe are already behind in terms of how many doctors are available to care for a certain number of the population,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody is in a remote part of town where he doesn\u2019t have access to these specialized services, but needs it, the referring doctor could actually use this telemedicine thing to get access to the best of care.\u201d",

      "VIENNA -- As construction crews churned up dirt to renovate a Vienna soccer field last October, they happened upon an unprecedented find: A heap of intertwined skeletal remains in a mass grave dating to the 1st-century Roman Empire, likely the bodies of warriors in a battle involving Germanic tribes.",
      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",

      "The victims were all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health.",
      "Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave \u2013 armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.",
      "The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second.",

      "Netanyahu's four-day visit to Budapest is a sign of both his close relationship with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and the latter's growing hostility toward international institutions, like the International Criminal Court, of which his country is a member.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, a conservative populist and close Netanyahu ally, has vowed to disregard the ICC warrant against the Israeli leader, accusing the world\u2019s top war crimes court based in The Hague, Netherlands, of \u201cinterfering in an ongoing conflict for political purposes.\u201d",
      "Members of Orb\u00e1n's government have suggested that Hungary, which became a signatory to the court in 2001, could withdraw. Currently, all countries in the 27-member European Union, including Hungary, are signatories, and all members of the court are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil. But the court has no way to enforce that.",
      "The ICC, the world\u2019s only permanent global tribunal for war crimes and genocide, issued the arrest warrant in November for Netanyahu as well as for his former defense minister and Hamas\u2019 military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza after the Hamas attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians, including children, have been killed during the Israeli military\u2019s response.",
      "The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza \u2014 charges that Israeli officials deny.",
      "The ICC has criticized Hungary's decision to defy its warrant for Netanyahu. The court's spokesperson, Fadi El Abdallah, said that it's not for parties to the ICC \u201cto unilaterally determine the soundness of the Court\u2019s legal decisions.\u201d",
      "Participating states have an obligation to enforce the court\u2019s decisions, El Ebdallah told The Associated Press in an email, and may consult with the court if they disagree with its rulings.",

      "Longtime allies and fellow practitioners of \u201cilliberal\u201d governance \u2014 a term adopted by Orb\u00e1n that denotes a rejection of the tenets of liberal democracy \u2014 the two leaders are also allied with U.S. President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in February imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.",
      "Orb\u00e1n's government has said that Trump's return to the White House has enabled it to take measures it was unable to during the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden \u2014 such as passing legislation to ban LGBTQ+ Pride events in Hungary.",
      "Erika Guevara-Rosas, the head of Global Research, Advocacy and Policy of human rights group Amnesty International, said in a statement that Hungary \u201cmust arrest (Netanyahu) if he travels to the country and hand him over to the Court.\u201d",

      "Liz Evenson, international justice director at rights group Human Rights Watch, said that Hungary allowing Netanyahu's visit was a breach of Hungary\u2019s ICC obligations, and \"would be Orban\u2019s latest assault on the rule of law, adding to the country\u2019s dismal record on rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll ICC member countries need to make clear they expect Hungary to abide by its obligations to the court, and that they will do the same,\" Evenson said.",
      "In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. Putin visited Mongolia, which is also a member of the ICC, in September last year, but he wasn't arrested. Last year, judges found that the country failed to uphold its legal obligations and referred the matter to the court\u2019s oversight body.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The rival leaders of ethnically divided Cyprus made some progress Wednesday on fostering trust between their conflict-riven Greek and Turkish speaking communities, agreeing to delve deeper into the dangers posed by minefields and working together on environmental initiatives.",
      "But the two sides still have a long way to go to formally restart moribund peace talks, with both leaders alluding to the ongoing fundamental rift on the kind of a peace deal each side expects.",
      "In a joint statement following the United Nations-hosted meeting, Ersin Tatar, the leader of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots and Nikos Christodoulides, the island\u2019s Greek Cypriot President, said they also agreed on restoring neglected cemeteries and setting up a joint group of young people from both sides of the divide to discuss issues relevant to them.",
      "The measures echoed those the two leaders agreed to pursue in a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Geneva last month that aimed to breathe new life into a peace process on hiatus for nearly eight years. Guterres said he will appoint an envoy tasked with getting formal peace talks restarted.",

      "Greek Cypriots say any deal that entrenches the island\u2019s partition is a non-starter as it contravenes long-held U.N. resolutions endorsing a federation.",
      "They also reject a Turkish and Turkish Cypriot demand for a permanent Turkish troop presence and military intervention rights under any accord, as well as giving the minority Turkish Cypriots veto power over all federal-level government decisions.",

    "story": [
      "India\u2019s parliament has begun debating a proposal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government to change laws governing Muslim land endowments in the country",
      "SRINAGAR, India -- SRINAGAR, India (AP) \u2014 India \u2019s parliament on Wednesday began discussing a controversial proposal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government to amend laws governing Muslim land endowments in the country.",
      "The bill would add non-Muslims to boards that manage waqf land endowments and give the government a larger role in validating their land holdings.",
      "The government says the changes will help to fight corruption and mismanagement while promoting diversity, but critics fear that it will further undermine the rights of the country's Muslim minority and could be used to confiscate historic mosques and other property from them.",
      "Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the Waqf Amendment Bill on Wednesday, which would reform a 1995 law that set rules for the foundations and set up state-level boards to administer them.",
      "Debate in the parliament\u2019s Lower House is expected to be heated as the Congress-led opposition is firmly against the proposal. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party does not have a majority but may be able to depends on allies to pass the bill. Both BJP and the Congress have asked their lawmakers to be present in the House.",
      "If passed, the bill will need to clear the Upper House before it is sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent to become a law.",
      "Many Muslim groups as well as the opposition parties say the proposal is discriminatory, politically motivated and an attempt by Modi\u2019s ruling party to weaken the minority rights.",
      "The controversial bill was first introduced in parliament last year, but was later sent to a committee of lawmakers for discussion after opposition parties raised concerns. The committee\u2019s report was tabled in both houses of parliament on Feb. 13 amid protests by opposition leaders who said that their inputs were ignored. The government claims that opposition parties are using rumors to discredit them and block transparency in managing the endowments.",
      "Waqfs are a traditional type of Islamic charitable foundation in which a donor permanently sets aside property \u2014 often but not always real estate \u2014 for religious or charitable purposes.",
      "Waqfs in India control 872,000 properties that cover 405,000 hectares (1 million acres) of land, worth an estimated $14.22 billion. Some of these endowments date back centuries, and many are used for mosques, seminaries, graveyards and orphanages.",
      "In India, waqf property is managed by semi-official boards, one for each of the country\u2019s states and federally-run union territories. The law would require non-Muslims to be appointed to the boards.",
      "Currently, waqf boards are staffed by Muslims, like similar bodies that help administer other religious charities.",
      "One of the most controversial amendments is the change to ownership rules, which potentially could impact historical mosques, shrines and graveyards under the waqf. It could change the ownership rules of many of these properties which lack formal documentation as they were donated without legal records decades, and sometimes, even centuries ago.",
      "Other changes could impact historic mosques, whose land is often held in centuries-old waqfs.",
      "Hindu radical groups have targeted mosques across the country and laid claim to several of them, arguing they are built on the ruins of important Hindu temples. Many such cases are pending in courts.",
      "The law would require waqf boards to seek approval from a district level officer to confirm waqfs' claims to property.",
      "Critics say that would undermine the board and could lead to Muslims being stripped of their land. It's not clear how often the boards would be asked to confirm such claims to land.",
      "While many Muslims agree that waqfs suffer from corruption, encroachments and poor management, they also fear that the new law could give India\u2019s Hindu nationalist government far greater control over Muslim properties, particularly at a time when attacks against the minority communities have become more aggressive under Modi, with Muslims often targeted for everything from their food and clothing styles to inter-religious marriages.",
      "Last month, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its annual report that religious freedom conditions in India continued to deteriorate while Modi and his party \u201cpropagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities\u201d during last year\u2019s election campaign.",
      "Modi's government says India is run on democratic principles of equality and no discrimination exists in the country.",
      "Muslims, which make 14 percent of India\u2019s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation but they are also the poorest, a 2013 government survey found.",

      "The parade, held every year on April 1, drew thousands of Assyrians from Iraq and across the diaspora, who marched through Dohuk in northern Iraq waving Assyrian flags and wearing colorful traditional clothes.",
      "Witnesses said the attacker, who has not been officially identified, ran toward the crowd shouting Islamic slogans.",

      "Men in Greece will be barred from having children via surrogacy if they are single or in a same-sex relationship",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Men in Greece will be barred from having children via surrogacy if they are single or in a same-sex relationship, the justice minister said Tuesday, asserting that it's intended to eliminate legal ambiguity over the concept of inability to carry a pregnancy.",
      "Giorgos Floridis said the proposed changes will be submitted to parliament soon as part of broader civil code reform.",
      "\u201cWe are now clarifying unequivocally that the concept of inability to carry a pregnancy does not refer to an inability arising from one\u2019s gender,\u201d Floridis told reporters. \u201cIn other words, a woman may be unable to carry a pregnancy whether she is in a male-female couple, a female same-sex couple or on her own.\"",
      "Greece legalized same-sex marriage last year \u2014 the first Orthodox Christian-majority country to do so. The marriage equality law was opposed by Greece\u2019s powerful Orthodox Church and conservative groups. Parliament approved civil partnerships for gay couples in 2015.",
      "In contrast to growing consensus in support of same-sex marriage, Europe\u2019s legal landscape for surrogacy varies widely. Many countries prohibit all forms of the practice or impose restrictions.",

      "He wears his suits like armor, smiles like a pop star and has more than 2 million followers on TikTok",
      "PARIS -- He wears his suits like armor, smiles like a pop star and boasts more than 2 million followers on TikTok. At just 29, Jordan Bardella has become the fresh-faced figurehead of France\u2019s National Rally party and is now poised to inherit one of the most electorally successful far-right machines in Europe.",
      "But behind the image of youthful confidence lies a question increasingly whispered by allies and adversaries alike: Can Bardella, who has no experience in government, really lead?",
      "The presidential ambitions of Bardella's mentor, Marine Le Pen, are likely over after a French court convicted her of embezzling European Union funds and barred her from holding office for five years. That means Bardella finds himself the last man standing atop the largest party in the French National Assembly. But having the spotlight doesn\u2019t mean he commands the stage.",
      "Critics call him Le Pen\u2019s puppet. Le Pen calls him her asset.",
      "On Monday night, she seemed to suggest the moment of reckoning might be approaching sooner than expected.",
      "\u201cI hope we won\u2019t have to use that asset sooner than necessary,\u201d she told the TF1 television network.",
      "Bardella was born in 1995 in the gritty suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis \u2014 a place more often in headlines for gang violence and poverty than political promise. He grew up in public housing, the son of Italian and Algerian heritage. His father ran a vending machine business. His family scraped together enough to send him to a semi-private Catholic school. He never finished university.",
      "But ambition moved faster than education. At 17, he joined the National Rally \u2014 then still known as the National Front, a party shunned by polite society and defined by the legacy of Jean-Marie Le Pen. For most, it was a dead end. For Bardella, it was a launchpad.",
      "By 23, he was a member of the European Parliament. By 26, Marine Le Pen had made him party president \u2014 the first person outside the Le Pen family to lead the far-right movement in its half-century history. It was a symbolic handover, but also a calculated move to modernize a brand long stained by racism and antisemitism.",
      "\u201cJordan Bardella is the creation of Marine Le Pen,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a Stanford University professor and expert on the French far right. \u201cHe has been made by her and is extremely loyal.\u201d",
      "He quickly became the party\u2019s face: camera-ready, uncontroversial and fluent in the aesthetics of modern politics. While Le Pen kept hold of the ideological reins, Bardella toured the country as the youthful ambassador of a rebranded movement.",
      "Their alliance was once pitched as a kind of American-style ticket \u2014 she for president, he for prime minister. But that balance no longer holds. With Le Pen sidelined, Bardella is no longer the backup.",
      "The problem is, he was never meant to lead.",
      "Bardella has never held national office. He\u2019s never run a ministry. But he has built a following. With an outsized social media presence and a slick, stage-managed image, he has become a star among young voters, offering a set of politics that looks fresh, even when the message is familiar.",
      "His content is clean, curated and relentlessly on message. Campaign videos feature sharp suits, barbed quips at President Emmanuel Macron and selfie lines at rally stops. He doesn\u2019t improvise. He doesn\u2019t deviate.",
      "That discipline has helped broaden the National Rally\u2019s appeal, especially in the aftermath of Macron\u2019s defeat in the 2024 European elections. Bardella was the one who demanded Macron dissolve Parliament. When Macron agreed, Bardella\u2019s status shifted from party mascot to potential prime minister.",
      "Yet the more visible he becomes, the more his limitations show.",
      "Last week, Bardella traveled to Israel in a bid to bolster his image on the world stage. It backfired. Major Jewish organizations boycotted the event he attended. Israeli President Isaac Herzog stayed away. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered only a brief, formal handshake.",
      "The French press called the visit a reputational flop \u2014 a trip meant to signal international stature that ended up highlighting its absence. Bardella may wear the suit, but many say he hasn\u2019t yet grown into it.",
      "At home, his platform is standard fare for the far right: stricter immigration laws, fewer social benefits for noncitizens and limits on dual nationals holding sensitive public jobs. He\u2019s pledged lower energy taxes, a reversal of Macron\u2019s pension reform and a ban on mobile phones in high schools.",
      "Abroad, he\u2019s attempted to sound more statesmanlike, voicing support for arming Ukraine, labeling Russia a \u201cmultidimensional threat\u201d and calling for France to eventually exit NATO\u2019s integrated command, though not while war rages in Europe.",
      "It\u2019s a program designed to reassure nervous voters while keeping the movement\u2019s nationalist core intact.",
      "\u201cHe has a clean slate and comes with no baggage of the past,\u201d Alduy said.",
      "But the real question isn\u2019t about his past. It\u2019s whether he\u2019s ready for what comes next.",
      "For now, Bardella walks a fine line as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who was suddenly promoted, the frontman who's trying to become the act.",
      "His strength lies in presentation. The suit, the smile, the soundbites \u2014 they\u2019re all in place. His weakness is what lies behind that performance. That\u2019s still in question.",
      "The French press has criticized Bardella for failing to prepare his party for real power. National Rally figures have said his leadership has focused more on personal promotion than on collective progress, more about boosting his own image than caring about the party or building a serious governing force.",
      "Others have linked him to a lack of structure and professionalism inside the party. Projects he once promised \u2014 from recruiting outside talent to strengthening local networks \u2014 have stalled. Key voices say the party is too centralized, too top-down and too afraid to challenge its young leader.",
      "Whether Bardella becomes the future of French politics or just its most polished understudy will depend not on Marine Le Pen but on whether he can become more than her invention.",

      "The renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained recruits has revealed some details about how one of the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels operates",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico, where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained recruits, has revealed some details about how one of the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels operates.",
      "The cartel, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says has some 19,000 in its ranks, developed rapidly into an extremely violent and capable force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel following the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio \u201cNacho\u201d Coronel Villarreal by the military.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is led by Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cel Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture. Oseguera drew renewed attention this week after his image was projected as a band played at a music festival in Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "The Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels have battled for control of various parts of Mexico, including Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala. Both are among six Mexican organized crime groups recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government.",
      "One of authorities\u2019 recent advances against Jalisco was the arrest of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Lastra, allegedly in charge of the cartel\u2019s recruitment.",
      "The Jalisco cartel employs three recruiting methods: there are volunteers drawn by the pay and imagined lifestyle, which experts say make up the bulk of their number; there\u2019s targeted recruitment of ex-military and police forces, who because of their professional training enter the cartel as trainers and leaders of squads of gunmen. Finally, there's the kind of forced recruitment that investigators say happened at the Jalisco ranch.",
      "For that last category, authorities say the cartel uses social platforms \u2014 they\u2019ve identified at least 60 pages \u2014 to offer fake job opportunities, especially as security guards, with weekly salaries of $600, well above the average for such positions. Once they have the applicants, they force them to join the cartel.",
      "One recruit who reportedly survived the ranch has said that the cartel picked up recruits at bus stations under false pretenses and took them to the ranch where they were trained for a month in the use of weapons in addition to fitness training, Mexico\u2019s Public Security Secretary Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said. Those who refused or tried to escape were beaten, tortured and killed.",
      "Security analyst David Saucedo said Jalisco\u2019s structure is vertical, with Oseguera at the top.",
      "Last weekend, pictures of Oseguera were projected as a band started playing at a regional music festival in Jalisco. Some in the crowd cheered and on Monday President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as Jalisco's governor, condemned the act. The Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office said it was opening an investigation. Such displays of respect for cartel leaders are not uncommon.",
      "Below Oseguera are regional commands, as well as areas responsible for drug production and sales, Saucedo said.",
      "The DEA says the cartel has a presence in 21 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states, exceeding the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s 19. Some analysts believe Jalisco is actually in as many as 25 states, including its home base in the state of the same name. It also maintains a presence in some 100 countries, according to the DEA.",
      "In less than two decades, Jalisco became one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal organizations and even managed to take control of some traditional strongholds of the Sinaloa cartel. Sinaloa has been weakened more recently by infighting among its factions following arrests of key leaders, including Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is serving a life sentence in the U.S., and Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, who was arrested last July along with one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons and is awaiting trial in the U.S.",
      "Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology researcher Carlos Flores said Jalisco\u2019s \u201ccapacity for violent action\u201d and style of \u201cirregular warfare\u201d aided its speedy rise, which coincided with the emergence of fentanyl as a highly profitable revenue stream.",
      "Saucedo says that Jalisco has also successfully allied itself with other criminal groups, allowing it to penetrate some territories with a sort of \u201cfranchise\u201d model as in the central state of Aguascalientes and the key border city of Tijuana.",
      "The case of the ranch also serves as an example of how the Jalisco cartel is able to operate with impunity in territory it controls thanks to the complicity of local authorities, Flores said.",
      "Despite being discovered in September 2024 and 10 people being arrested, the ranch\u2019s investigation stalled until family members searching for their relatives went there themselves in March and raised the alarm about hundreds of clothing items they found, as well as apparent bone fragments. Since then, authorities have detained three local police officers who were allegedly tied to disappearances at the ranch.",
      "\u201cThere are signs that show publicly how those kinds of deals have allowed the Jalisco cartel to establish itself in certain states, while they go about eliminating their rivals, sometimes with the help of public safety forces,\u201d Flores said.",

      "A Jesuit priest says he will rather go to prison than pay a fine of 500 euros or $541 for participating in a climate activists\u2019 street blockade in the southern German city of Nuremberg",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A Jesuit priest says he prefers going to prison than paying a 500-euro ($541) fine for participating in a climate activists' street blockade in the southern German city of Nuremberg.",
      "The Rev. J\u00f6rg Alt started serving his nearly monthlong prison sentence on Tuesday in Nuremberg.",
      "\u201cToday, I am starting my 25-day alternative custodial sentence in Nuremberg prison,\u201d he said before entering the prison. \u201cI don\u2019t like doing this, especially as my health is no longer the best at the age of 63. But I see no alternative, because it\u2019s the last form of protest I have left in this specific case to draw attention to important issues\u201d such as climate change.",
      "In November, Alt said that \"as a priest, I have no income and no bank account due to my vow of poverty and that I do not want to harm the order and my fellow brothers by paying my fine,\u201d German news agency dpa reported.",
      "His remarks came after a Bavarian Higher Regional Court rejected his appeal to a lower court's decision and confirmed Alt's conviction for coercion for participating in a sit-in blockade.",
      "After the court's decision, authorities repeatedly asked Alt to pay the 500 euros, before the fine was eventually commuted to the 25-day prison sentence.",
      "The court ruling in November was in connection with a street blockade in August 2022, when the Jesuit priest and about 40 other activists blocked traffic in Nuremberg by gluing their hands to a street in front of the city's train station to draw attention to climate change.",
      "Numerous similar protests have taken place across Germany and other countries in recent years, as activists try to draw attention to the urgency of tackling climate change. The public and political response to such road blockades has been mixed.",
      "While some Germans have said they support the protesters\u2019 cause, if not their means, activists have also faced violence from enraged motorists and calls for tough punishment from conservative politicians.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has sharply criticized climate activists as \u201c nutty\u201d for drastic protests such as blocking streets or gluing themselves to famous paintings in museums.",
      "Last year, activists belonging to one of the main protest groups, the Last Generation, announced that they would abandon the tactic and move on to holding what they call \u201cdisobedient assemblies.\u201d",
      "Alt has said that he had also decided to serve the prison sentence instead of paying the fine \"in solidarity with those climate activists who are treated similarly by the administration and the judiciary \u2014 it may all be lawful, but it is unjust.\u201d",
      "It's not the first time, that Alt was convicted for his activism. In May 2023, a court also convicted him of coercion after he participated in a road blockade in Munich and ordered him to pay a small fine.",

      "Scientists at the world\u2019s largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve enigmas of physics, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of about $16 billion",
      "GENEVA -- Scientists at the world's largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve remaining enigmas of physics.",
      "The plans for the Future Circular Collider \u2014 a nearly 91-kilometer (56.5-mile) loop along the French-Swiss border and even below Lake Geneva \u2014 published late on Monday put the finishing details on a project roughly a decade in the making at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.",
      "The study lays out features like the proposed path, environmental impact, scientific ambitions and cost of the project. Independent experts will take a look before CERN's two-dozen member countries \u2014 all European except for Israel \u2014 decide in 2028 whether to go forward, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of some 14 billion Swiss francs (about $16 billion).",
      "CERN officials have touted the promise of scientific discoveries that could drive innovation in areas like cryogenics, superconducting magnets and vacuum technologies that could benefit humankind. Outside experts pointed to the promise of learning more about the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang",
      "\u201cThis set of reports represents an important milestone in the process, but a full sense of the likelihood of it being brought to fruition will only be known through careful studies by scientists, engineers and others, including politicians who must make difficult decisions at time when uncertainty rules the day,\u201d said Dave Toback, a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas A&M University, in an e-mail.",
      "The new collider \u201cprovides and exciting opportunity for the particle physics community, and indeed all of physics, on the world stage,\u201d said Toback, who was not affiliated with the study, and who worked for years at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in the United States that was shut down in 2011.",
      "For roughly a decade, top minds at CERN have been cooking up plans for a successor to the Large Hadron Collider, a network of magnets that accelerate particles through a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel and slams them together at velocities approaching the speed of light.",
      "Work at the particle collider confirmed in 2013 the existence of the Higgs boson \u2014 the central piece in a puzzle known as the standard model that helps explains some fundamental forces in the universe.",
      "CERN scientists, engineers and partners behind the study considered at least 100 different scenarios for the new collider before coming up with the proposed 91-kilometer circumference at an average depth of 200 meters (656 feet). The tunnel would be about 5 meters (16 feet) in diameter, CERN said.",
      "\u201cUltimately what we would like to do is a collider which will come up with ten times more energy than what we have today,\" said Arnaud Marsollier, a CERN spokesman. \u201cWhen you have more energy, then you can create particles that are heavier.\u201d",
      "A bigger collider would also offer greater precision to help plumb particularities of the Higgs boson, which \u201cwe have kind of a blurry image of\u201d now, he added.",

      "Rescue workers have saved a 63-year-old woman from earthquake rubble in Myanmar\u2019s capital",
      "BANGKOK -- Rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a civil war.",
      "The fire department in Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit midday Friday. Experts say the likelihood of finding survivors drops dramatically after 72 hours.",
      "The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, told a forum for relief donations in Naypyitaw that 2,719 people have now been found dead, with 4,521 others injured and 441 missing, Myanmar's state MRTV television reported.",
      "He said Friday\u2019s earthquake was the second most powerful in the country's recorded history after a magnitude 8 quake east of Mandalay in May 1912.",
      "The casualty figures are widely expected to rise. The earthquake hit a wide swath of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, making the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.",
      "Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, the capital.",
      "\u201cThe needs are massive, and they are rising by the hour,\u201d said Julia Rees, UNICEF's deputy representative for Myanmar.",
      "Myanmar's fire department said 403 people have been rescued in Mandalay and 259 bodies have been found so far. In one incident, 50 Buddhist monks who were taking a religious exam in a monastery were killed when the building collapsed, and 150 more are thought to be buried in the rubble.",
      "The World Health Organization said more than 10,000 buildings overall are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged by the quake.",
      "The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing a high-rise building under construction to collapse and burying many workers.",
      "Two bodies were pulled from the rubble Monday and another was recovered Tuesday, but dozens were still missing. Overall, there were 22 people killed and 34 injured in Bangkok, primarily at the construction site.",
      "In Myanmar, search and rescue efforts across the affected area paused briefly at midday Tuesday as people stood for a minute in silent tribute to the dead.",
      "Foreign aid workers have been arriving slowly to help in the rescue efforts, but progress lagged due to a lack of heavy machinery in many places.",
      "In one site in Naypyitaw on Tuesday, workers formed a human chain, passing chunks of brick and concrete out hand-by-hand from the ruins of a collapsed building.",
      "The state Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday that a team of Chinese rescuers saved four people the day before from the ruins of an apartment complex. They included a 5-year-old and a pregnant woman who had been trapped for more than 60 hours.",
      "It also reported that two teenagers were able to crawl out of the rubble of the same building using their cellphone flashlights to help guide them. Rescue workers were then able to use details from what they told them to locate their grandmother and sibling.",
      "International rescue teams from several countries are on the scene, including from Russia, China, India, the United Arab Emirates and several Southeast Asian countries.",
      "A small U.S. Agency for International Development disaster assessment team arrived Tuesday to determine how best to respond given limited U.S. resources due to the slashing of the foreign aid budget and dismantling of the agency as an independent operation.",
      "A U.S. official said the three-person team had waited for visas before making the trip from neighboring Thailand following a weekend decision to provide $2 million in emergency assistance to Myanmar. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the team\u2019s arrival has not yet been publicly announced.",
      "Meantime, multiple countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead.",
      "Even before the earthquake, more than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes by Myanmar's brutal civil war, and nearly 20 million were in need, according to the U.N.",
      "Many were already lacking in basic medical care and standard vaccinations, and the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure by the earthquake and the movement of people into overcrowded shelters raises the risk of disease outbreaks, warned the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.",
      "\u201cVulnerability to respiratory infections, skin diseases, vector-borne illnesses such as dengue fever, and vaccine-preventable diseases like measles is escalating,\u201d OCHA said in its latest report.",
      "Shelter is also a major problem, especially with the monsoon season looming.",
      "Since the earthquake, many people have been sleeping outside, either because homes were destroyed or out of fear of aftershocks.",
      "Myanmar's military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance and a brutal civil war.",
      "Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places were dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach even before the quake.",
      "Military attacks and those from some anti-military groups have not stopped in the aftermath of the earthquake, though the shadow opposition National Unity Government has called a unilateral ceasefire for its forces.",
      "The NUG, established by elected lawmakers who were ousted in 2021, called for the international community to ensure humanitarian aid is delivered directly to the earthquake victims, urging \u201cvigilance against any attempts by the military junta to divert or obstruct humanitarian assistance,\" saying that could have \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire plan for the armed wing of the NUG, called the People's Defense Force, would have little effect on the battlefield, but could draw more international condemnation of continuing operations by the military, including air attacks reported by independent media.",
      "A second armed opposition group, a coalition of three powerful ethnic minority guerrilla armies called the Three Brotherhood Alliance, announced Tuesday that it would also implement a monthlong unilateral ceasefire.",
      "Before the announcement, Min Aung Hlaing earler seemed to reject implementing a ceasefire, saying in his speech on Tuesday that the military will continue to take necessary defensive measures against some ethnic armed groups that were currently not carrying out combat operations, but were conducting military training, which he said amounted to hostile action.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether the military has been impeding humanitarian aid. In the past, it initially refused to allow in foreign rescue teams or many emergency supplies after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which resulted in well more than 100,000 deaths. Even once it did allow foreign assistance, it was with severe restrictions.",
      "In this case, however, Min Aung Hlaing pointedly said on the day of the earthquake that the country would accept outside help.",
      "Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, said on X that to facilitate aid, military attacks must stop.",
      "\u201cThe focus in Myanmar must be on saving lives, not taking them,\u201d he said.",

      "Export manufacturing and free trade helped transform China and other Asian countries into economic powerhouses",
      "BANGKOK -- The trade war that U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated in his second term is a challenge for all Asian economies, large and small, in an era when the most populous region of the world is expected to drive global economic growth.",
      "Export manufacturing and free trade helped transform China and other Asian countries into economic powerhouses over the past decades. Trump\u2019s barrages of tariffs, aimed at compelling companies to keep or set up their factories in the United States, are rupturing trade agreements often made at great political cost to trading partners.",
      "The White House says the criteria for raising tariffs will include not just U.S. trade deficits but also various taxes, exchange rates, government subsidies and various non-tariff trade barriers. Apart from the tariffs to be announced on Wednesday's \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d as Trump calls it, 25% tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts are due to take effect on Thursday.",
      "Trump has also ordered levies against China, Canada and Mexico; expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum, and imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from Venezuela. He plans more import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "Higher costs already have led many manufacturers to shift away from China to other economies in South and Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. But for now the prevailing uncertainty over what Trump will do with what he calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs may lead most to sit tight and see what comes next.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no script for how reciprocal tariffs get priced, and uncertainty is the only constant,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said.",
      "Here's a look at how higher U.S. tariffs might affect some major Asian economies.",
      "Despite some decrease in trade since Trump launched a trade war with China during his first term in office, the U.S. trade deficit has continued to climb, hitting $295.4 billion last year.",
      "China, the world's No. 2 economy, has leaned heavily on exports to make up for weak demand at home. The ruling Communist Party has made exports of autos, especially electric vehicles, and batteries a priority, but 27.5% tariffs on auto exports and 102.5% duties on EVs have in effect closed the U.S. market for its automakers. China is the second largest supplier of auto parts to the U.S. behind Mexico.",
      "During Trump's first term, higher tariffs led leader Xi Jinping to champion a shift to high-tech production. That will likely continue as U.S. pressure intensifies, causing job losses due to changes in manufacturing rather than direct damage from the tariffs themselves, Raymond Yeung of ANZ Research said in a report.",
      "As Trump has rolled out rounds of tariff hikes that have piled on an extra 20%, China has raised its own import duties, targeting U.S. farm goods. It also expanded export controls, especially on strategically important minerals used in high-tech electronics.",
      "U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China have fallen since the beginning of the year, and are expected to fall further after Beijing imposed a 15% tariff on U.S. LNG imports.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Tuesday that his government was making last ditch efforts to get the United States to exclude his country from auto tariffs. The U.S. absorbs about one-fifth of Japan's exports, or about 1.5 million passenger cars a year.",
      "Even though major Japanese automakers like Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. have factories in the U.S. and increasingly, in Mexico, it's an important industry back home. Nearly 5.6 million people are employed in auto-related jobs, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturing Association.",
      "Japan's exports of electronics, machinery, chemicals and steel are also potential targets. A central bank survey released Monday found business sentiment among large manufacturers worsened in the past quarter, for the first time in a year. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 share benchmark has fallen more than 10% in the past three months, while shares in Toyota Motor Corp. have tumbled 27%.",
      "More than 60% of the self-governed island's economy comes from exports, and it ran a trade surplus with the U.S. of nearly $74 billion last year. Computer chips are one of Taiwan's biggest exports to the United States, along with computers and other office machines and consumer products.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. is expanding its U.S. factories in Arizona, enticed by U.S. incentives and its own strategic needs. In early March, its CEO C.C. Wei pledged $100 billion in new U.S. investments.",
      "South Korea ran a $66 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year, and autos, electronics and computer chips were a large share. The country could boost investments in making autos, steel, and semiconductors in the U.S. and also consider revising the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement to promote more balanced trade, Patrick Cronin of the Hudson Institute said in a recent report.",
      "South Korea is among several big importers of LNG that may try to buy more of the gas from the US to help balance trade, researchers at RaboBank said in a recent report.",
      "Like most of its Southeast Asian neighbors, Vietnam has emulated Japan, China and other major exporting nations in relying on trade and foreign investment to develop their economies.",
      "It had the third-largest trade surplus with the United States last year, after Mexico and China, at $123.5 billion. Its biggest exports are machinery, textiles and footwear.",
      "A 14% increase in exports helped Vietnam's economy expand at a sizzling 7.1% annual rate last year. The government recently said it would slash tariffs on LNG, autos, ethanol and some other farm products, moves meant to placate Trump and reduce its trade surplus. Vietnam also has agreed to allow a five-year trial launch of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service.",
      "The world's most populous country ran a trade surplus of nearly $46 billion with the U.S. in 2024, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office. The main exports are medicines and chemicals to make them, pearls, diamonds and other gems.",

      "The Senate GOP\u2019s budget framework would be the companion to the House Republicans' $4.5 trillion tax cuts package that also calls for cutting some $2 trillion from health care and other programs.

      "Thune and Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee are meeting with Trump before the expected public release of their budget blueprint by the committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as soon as the afternoon.",
      "While big differences remain, Republicans face increasing political pressure to deliver on what is expected to be Trump\u2019s signature domestic policy package: extending the tax cuts, which were initially approved in 2017, during his first term at the White House. Those tax breaks expire at the end of the year, and Trump wants to expand them to include new no taxes on tipped wages, overtime pay and other earnings, as he promised during the 2024 campaign.",
      "Democrats are preparing to oppose the GOP tax plans as giveaways to the wealthy, coming as billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is taking a \u201cchain saw\u201d to the federal government. They warn Republicans plan to cut government programs and services that millions of Americans depend on nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are standing together against the GOP tax scam and in defense of the American people,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said alongside others on the Capitol steps late Tuesday.",
      "One main sticking point between the House and Senate GOP plans has been over whether the existing tax cuts, which are estimated to cost the federal government $4.5 trillion over the decade in lost revenue, need to be paid for by spending reductions elsewhere. Adding Trump's new tax breaks to the package would balloon the price tag.",
      "To offset the costs, House Republicans are demanding some $2 trillion in cuts to health care and other accounts to stem federal deficits and prevent the nation's $36 trillion debt load from skyrocketing.",
      "But GOP senators have a different approach. They take the view that because the tax cuts are already the current policy, they would not be new and would not need to be paid for. They want to use this current policy baseline moving forward, meaning only Trump's other proposed tax breaks would come with a new cost. They are expected to set much lower spending cuts as a floor that can be raised, if needed, to compromise with the House's $2 trillion in cuts.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and top Democrats call the Senate GOP's approach a gimmick at best, if not an outright \u201clie.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is an obscene fraud and the American people won\u2019t stand for it,\u201d said Schumer, Sen. Jeff Merkley of the Budget Committee and Sen. Ron Wyden of the Finance Committee in a letter to GOP leadership.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey argued against the GOP baseline as \u201ca gimmick\u201d that would cut important federal services while growing deficits.",
      "\u201cWhat they're investing in is bigger tax cuts for the wealthiest,\u201d Booker said during a landmark overnight speech.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and congressional GOP leaders have been meeting privately as Trump's priority package churns on Capitol Hill. At a meeting with other Senate Republicans late Monday at the Capitol, Bessent urged them to get it done.",
      "Typically, the current policy baseline proposal would need to pass the muster of the Senate's nonpartisan parliamentarian to make sure it abides by the strict rules of the budget process. Senators from both parties have been arguing in closed-door sessions with the parliamentarian staff \u2014 for and against the idea.",
      "But GOP leaders say they don\u2019t necessarily need the Senate parliamentarian, at this point, to resolve the issue, and they believe Graham, as the Senate Budget Committee chairman, has the authority to allow their current policy baseline approach.",
      "What is more certain is that they want to move quickly this week to pass the framework. That will entail a lengthy all-night vote that could drag into the weekend. Then, they will sort out the details later as the Republicans, facing Democratic opposition, build the actual package for consideration in the weeks, if not months, ahead.",

      "President Donald Trump is set to launch a barrage of so-called reciprocal tariffs on friend and foe alike",
      "WASHINGTON -- After weeks of White House hype and public anxiety, President Donald Trump is set Wednesday to announce a barrage of self-described \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on friend and foe alike.",
      "The new tariffs \u2014 coming on what Trump has called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 is a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he has said are years of unfair trade practices. But by most economists\u2019 assessments, the risky move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and mangle decades-old alliances.",
      "The White House is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble being undertaken.",
      "\u201cApril 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Tuesday\u2019s briefing while adding that the new tariffs will take effect immediately.",
      "The reciprocal tariffs Trump plans to announce follow similar recent announcements of 25% taxes on auto imports; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump has also put tariffs against countries that import oil from Venezuela and plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "None of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy.",
      "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has suggested that the new tariffs would raise $600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since World War II. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers that the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. But the White House has yet to confirm policy details, despite Trump saying on Monday that he had made his decision.",
      "Importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that a 20% universal tariff would cost the average household an additional $3,400 to $4,200.",
      "The administration's premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create new factory jobs \u2014 and the White House is expressing confidence that Trump\u2019s approach is absolutely correct.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be wrong,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cIt is going to work. And the president has a brilliant team of advisers who have been studying these issues for decades. And we are focused on restoring the golden age of America and making America a manufacturing superpower.\u201d",
      "The bold optimism has done little to reassure the public or allies who see the import taxes as a threat.",
      "Based on the possibility of broad 20% tariffs that have been floated by some White House aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. U.S. economic growth \u2014 as measured by gross domestic product \u2014 would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the Budget Lab analysis found.",
      "Trump would single-handedly be applying these tariffs, since he has ways of legally doing so without congressional approval. That makes it easy for Democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the Republican administration, if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are, in fact, signs of trouble to come.",
      "Heather Boushey, who served as a member of the Biden White House's Council of Economic Advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs Trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised,\" Boushey said. \u201cIt's a failed strategy.\u201d",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the tariffs were fundamentally a way for Trump to raise revenues in order to pay for his planned extensions of income tax cuts that disproportionately favor millionaires and billionaires.",
      "\u201cAlmost everything they do, including tariffs, it seems to me, is aimed at getting those tax cuts for the wealthy,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.",
      "Even Republicans who trust Trump's instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could be disruptive to an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 % unemployment rate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all develops,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \u201cIt may be rocky in the beginning. But I think that this will make sense for Americans and help all Americans.\u201d",
      "Longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. Canada has already imposed some in response to the 25% tariffs that Trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. The European Union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros' worth ($28 billion) of U.S. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted Trump to threaten a 200% tariff on European alcohol.",
      "Many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by Trump, who routinely says that friends and foes have essentially ripped off the United States with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers.",
      "The flip side, of course, is that Americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by French fashion houses and autos from German manufacturers, whereas World Bank data show the EU has lower incomes per capita than the United States.",
      "\u201cEurope has not started this confrontation,\u201d said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cWe do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it.\u201d",
      "Because Trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond U.S. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame.",
      "Ray Sparnaay, general manager of JE Fixture & Tool, a Canadian tool and die business that sits across the Detroit River, said the uncertainty has crushed his company's ability to make plans.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be tariffs implemented. We just don\u2019t know at this point,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest problems we\u2019ve had probably the last \u2014 well, since November \u2014 is the uncertainty. It\u2019s basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected U.S. airstrikes battered rebel-controlled areas of Yemen into Wednesday, with the Houthis saying one strike killed at least four people near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida.",
      "The intense campaign of airstrikes under President Donald Trump, targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters stemming from the Israel-Hamas war, has killed at least 65 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis.",
      "The campaign appears to show no signs of stopping as the Trump administration again linked their airstrikes on the Iranian-backed Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While so far giving no specifics about the campaign and its targets, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt put the overall number of strikes on Tuesday at over 200.",
      "\u201cIran is incredibly weakened as a result of these attacks and we have seen they have taken out Houthi leaders,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken out critical members who were launching strikes on naval ships and on commercial vessels and this operation will not stop until the freedom of navigation in this region is restored.\u201d",
      "The Houthis have not acknowledged the loss of any of its leadership so far \u2014 and the U.S. has not identified any official by name. However, messages released by the leak of a Signal conversation between Trump administration officials and their public comments suggest a leader in the rebels' missile forces had been targeted.",
      "Overnight, a likely U.S. airstrike targeted what the Houthis described as a \u201cwater project\u201d in Hodeida governorate's Mansuriyah District, killing four people and wounding others. Other strikes into Wednesday targeted Hajjah, Saada and Sanaa governorates, the rebels said.",
      "The rebels say they've continued to launch attacks against U.S. warships in the Red Sea, namely the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, which is launching the majority of the strikes on the Houthis. No warship has been struck yet, but the U.S. Navy has described the Houthi fire as the most intense combat its sailors have faced since World War II.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, now in Asia, is on its way to the Mideast to back up the Truman. Early Wednesday, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said \u201cadditional squadrons and other air assets\" would be deployed to the region, without elaborating.",
      "That likely includes the deployment of nuclear-capable B-2 bombers to Camp Thunder Bay on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Satellite photos taken Tuesday by Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press showed at least six B-2s at the base \u2014 nearly a third of all the bombers in America's arsenal.",

      "The Houthis on Tuesday claimed shooting down another American MQ-9 drone over the country.",
      "An Associated Press review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none has been hit.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war, which has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",

      "The New York Mets, with Juan Soto's record $61.9 million pay, led MLB for the third straight opening day with a $322.6 million payroll, just ahead of the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers at $319.5 million. Those two teams each spent roughly five times as much as the Miami Marlins, who at $64.9 million ended the Athletics\u2019 three-year streak as the lowest spender.",
      "Still, the Mets were down from their record high of $355.4 million in 2023.",
      "The average rose 3.6% to $5,160,245. That was up from a 1.5% increase last year but down from an 11.1% increase in 2023.",
      "Adding Blake Snell, Michael Conforto, Tanner Scott and Kirby Yates, the Dodgers boosted payroll by a big league-high $69 million from opening day last year. Baltimore hiked spending by $66 million, followed by Arizona ($55 million), San Diego ($47 million), Philadelphia ($41 million) and Detroit ($39 million).",
      "Los Angeles' payroll figure was held down by deferred payments. Shohei Ohtani\u2019s $70 million salary was discounted to a present-day value of $28.2 million because it won't be paid in full until 2035, causing him to be listed as the 18th-highest-paid player. Other Dodgers with deferred payments include Mookie Betts, Tommy Edman, Freddie Freeman, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, Scott, Will Smith and Snell.",
      "Following their record 121-loss season, the Chicago White Sox cut payroll by $60.8 million, San Francisco by $39.1 million, Miami by $31.7 million and St. Louis by $31.6 million. The American League champion Yankees dropped by $18.5 million.",

      "Of 953 players in the major leagues on opening day, 526 had salaries of $1 million or more, 55%, and down from 532 last year and 546 in 2023.",
      "There were 15 players at $30 million or more, a drop of two; 66 at $20 million, up from 66; and 177 at $10 million, an increase from 166.",
      "A total of 35 players made the $760,000 minimum.",
      "The top 50 players make 29% of the salaries, the same as in the prior two years, and the top 100 earn 48%, up from 47%.",
      "Baseball's median salary, the point at which an equal number of players are above and below, dropped to $1.35 million from $1.5 million and well below the record high of $1.65 million at the start of 2015.",
      "Average and median salaries decline over the course of the season as veterans are released and replaced by younger players making closer to the minimum. The AP's average was $4.98 million at the start of last season; MLB calculated the final average at $4.59 million and the players' association at $4.66 million.",
      "Because they started the season in the minor leagues, Baltimore pitcher Kyle Gibson ($5.25 million), Detroit pitcher Jason Foley ($3.15 million) and Dodgers second baseman Hyeseong Kim ($2.8 million) were among the players not included in the opening day payroll figures.",

      "\u201cWith each policy development, each rhetorical missive, we\u2019re just seeing unforced error after unforced error in the administration,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cIt has a direct impact on international travel to the U.S.\u201d",
      "The decline will have consequences for airlines, hotels, national parks and other sites frequented by tourists.",
      "Tourism Economics expects travel from Canada to plummet 20% this year, a decline that will be acutely felt in border states like New York and Michigan but also popular tourist destinations like California, Nevada and Florida.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, has also warned about Canadians staying away. Even a 10% reduction in travel from Canada could mean 2.0 million fewer visits, $2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses, the group said in February.",
      "Other travel-related companies have noted worrying signs. At its annual shareholder meeting on Monday, Air Canada said bookings to the U.S. were down 10% for the April-September period compared to the same period a year ago.",
      "Sacks said he now expects foreign visitors to spend $9 billion less in the U.S. compared to 2024, when international tourism to the country rose 9.1%.",
      "\u201cThe irony is that the tariffs are being put in place to help right the trade deficit, but they're harming the trade balance by causing fewer international travelers to come and spend money here,\u201d Sacks said.",
      "Sacks said international arrivals had been getting close to returning to 2019 numbers, before the coronavirus pandemic halted most travel. Now he thinks they won't get back to that level until 2029.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief tobacco regulator has been forced out",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief tobacco regulator has been removed from his post amid sweeping cuts at the agency and across the federal health workforce handed down Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "In an email to staff, FDA tobacco director Brian King said: \u201cIt is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave.\u201d",
      "King was removed from his position and offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service, according to a person familiar with the matter who did not have permission to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Dozens of staffers in FDA\u2019s tobacco center also received notices of dismissal Tuesday morning, including the entire office responsible for enforcing tobacco regulations.",
      "King, who joined the agency in 2022, has been vigorously criticized by vaping lobbyists for ordering thousands of companies to remove their fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes from the market. During his time at FDA, teen vaping has fallen to a 10-year low.",
      "His removal comes just days after FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks was forced out, citing health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support for vaccine \u201cmisinformation and lies\u201d in his resignation letter.",
      "The latest changes mean that nearly all of FDA\u2019s top leaders overseeing drugs, food, vaccines, medical devices and now tobacco products have resigned or retired in recent months.",
      "The leadership vacuum comes as Kennedy moves to fire 3,500 FDA staffers and pushes ahead with plans to scrutinize ultra-processed foods, childhood vaccines, antidepressants and other long-established products.",
      "The wave of departures means incoming FDA commissioner Marty Makary \u2014 who was confirmed last week\u2014 will inherit an agency without many of its top experts and a beleaguered workforce that has been rocked by weeks of layoffs and a chaotic return-to-office process. Only a handful of FDA employees are political appointees, with nearly all of the agency's scientific reviews and decisions overseen by career officials.",
      "Neither Makary nor Kennedy have said much about how tobacco policy fits into their plan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d Despite historically low rates of smoking, tobacco-related diseases remain the nation\u2019s leading preventable cause of death, blamed for more than 490,000 annually.",
      "In recent years, the FDA\u2019s tobacco center has been besieged by criticism from all sides including congressional lawmakers, anti-smoking advocates, and tobacco and vaping companies.",
      "Politicians, parents and anti-tobacco groups want the FDA to do more to stamp out unauthorized vaping products that can appeal to teens, many of which are imported from China. Tobacco and vaping companies say the FDA has been too slow to approve newer products for adult smokers \u2014 including e-cigarettes \u2014 that generally carry much lower risks than traditional cigarettes.",
      "Under King, the FDA rejected applications for millions of flavored e-cigarettes, citing insufficient data that the products would help adult smokers while not becoming popular with underage kids. Those rejections have resulted in multiple lawsuits against FDA from vape makers, including one that was argued before the Supreme Court in December.",
      "The Vapor Technology Association, an industry group, has been running ads urging Trump to follow through on a campaign pledge he made to \u201csave the flavored vaping industry.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s electronic voting system in a long-running lawsuit that alleged that the system is vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could deprive voters of their constitutional rights",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal judge has declined to block the use of Georgia's electronic voting system in a long-running lawsuit that alleged that the system is vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could deprive voters of their constitutional rights.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg found that the activists and individual voters who challenged the state's voting system did not prove that the problems they identified prevented them from voting, diluted their votes or kept their votes from being counted. She wrote in a ruling Monday that they lack standing to sue and she is unable to consider the merits of their claims.",
      "Georgia election officials have consistently said the system is secure and reliable and that it is up to the state to decide how it conducts elections.",
      "The ruling follows several years of intense focus on Georgia's elections in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's narrow loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Trump claimed without evidence that election fraud cost him victory, and his allies spread wild conspiracy theories about the Dominion Voting Systems machines used in Georgia.",
      "But the lawsuit at issue long precedes those claims. It was originally filed in 2017 by several individual voters and the Coalition for Good Governance, which advocates for election integrity, and targeted the outdated, paperless voting system used at the time. After Georgia purchased a new voting system in 2019, the suit was amended to target that system.",
      "The election system used statewide by nearly all in-person voters includes touch screen voting machines that print ballots with a human-readable summary of voters\u2019 selections and a QR code that a scanner reads to count the votes. The human-readable summary only lists the voter's choice, not the names of other candidates or the details of a ballot question.",
      "The activists and voters who filed the lawsuit argued that since people can't read a QR code, they are unable to ensure that what the scanners are reading accurately reflects their selections. They also asserted that it is burdensome for voters to have to check their selections twice \u2014 once on the voting machine screen and again using the limited information on the printed ballot.",
      "They asked Totenberg to stop the state from using the touch screen voting machine system as the standard method for in-person voting.",
      "\u201cAlthough Plaintiffs have not ultimately prevailed on their legal claims, their work has identified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance, and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system,\u201d Totenberg wrote. \u201cThese investigative and educational efforts have prompted meaningful legislative action to bolster the transparency and accountability of Georgia's voting systems.\u201d",
      "In addition to other changes, a law passed by Georgia lawmakers last year requires QR codes to be removed from ballots by July 2026, though she noted that funding and government action would be required to implement that change.",
      "The judge outlined the evidence presented at trial in early 2024, including the findings of University of Michigan computer scientist and professor J. Alex Halderman. He testified that an attacker could potentially alter the QR codes to change voter selections, install malware on the voting machines and obtain county-wide passwords, among other issues, she wrote.",
      "A report Halderman wrote in 2021 as part of this lawsuit prompted the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in 2022 to put out advisory recommending steps that should be taken by election officials in places that use the voting machines that Georgia uses. Georgia election officials in 2023 said they planned to wait until after the 2024 election to install a software update to address some of the security flaws, saying they had taken other measures to protect the state's voting system.",
      "Totenberg's ruling puts an end to a long and twisting path. Throughout the process she has repeatedly raised concerns about the state's voting system and practices and, early on, accused state officials of ignoring problems. In an August 2019 ruling, she prohibited the state from using its antiquated paperless voting machines beyond that year. The state had agreed to purchase new voting machines from Dominion a few weeks earlier and scrambled to deploy them ahead of the 2020 election cycle.",
      "Conspiracy theorists and people looking to give credence to Trump's claims of a stolen election have seized on Totenberg's intermediate rulings in the case, as well as on Halderman's findings. But Halderman has always made clear that his mission was to identify vulnerabilities in the system, that he was not tasked with looking for and had not found any evidence that those weaknesses had been exploited.",

      "That payment signaled trouble to investors. It showed that the other company, 0X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. II, didn't want to hold its 98% of stock. And it highlighted the way African Agriculture had used the merger to bypass the vetting process needed for listing.",
      "One year later, shares in African Agriculture were worth almost nothing.",
      "Now, security guards patrol the land's barbed-wire perimeter, blocking herders and farmers from using it. The company has been delisted.",
      "Mboup said he and others haven\u2019t been paid for six months. The workers took the company to employment court in Senegal to claim about $180,000 in unpaid wages. In February, they burned tires outside the company's office. Mboup later said an agreement was reached for back wages to be paid in June.",
      "\u201cI took out loans to build a house and now I can\u2019t pay it back,\u201d said Mboup, who had been making $200 a month, just above average for Senegal. \u201cI\u2019ve sold my motorbike and sheep to feed my children and send them to school, but many are not so lucky.\u201d",
      "Timis didn't respond to questions. Seck told the AP he was no longer affiliated with African Agriculture. Current CEO Mike Rhodes said he had been advised to not comment.",
      "Herders and farmers are furious and have urged Senegal's government to let them use the land. But that rarely happens. In a study of 63 such foreign deals, the International Institute of Social Studies found only 11% of land was returned to the community. In most cases, the land is offered to other investors.",
      "\u201cWe want to work with the government to rectify this situation. If not, we will fight,\" warned Bayal Sow, the area\u2019s deputy mayor.",
      "The Senegalese minister of agriculture, food sovereignty and herding, Mabouba Diagne, did not respond to questions. The African Agriculture deal occurred under the previous administration.",
      "The failed project has undermined community trust, said herder Adama Sow, 74: \u201cBefore, we lived in peace, but now there\u2019s conflict for those of us who supported them.\"",
      "Meanwhile, African Agriculture's former CEO has moved on to a bigger land deal elsewhere on the continent \u2014 with experts raising questions again.",
      "In August, South African Alan Kessler announced his new company, African Food Security, partnering with a Cameroonian, Baba Danpullo. It has announced a project roughly 30 times the size of the one in Senegal, with 635,000 hectares in Congo and Cameroon.",
      "The new company seeks $875 million in investment. The company\u2019s investor prospectus, obtained by the AP, says it plans to register in Abu Dhabi.",
      "In an interview with the AP in January, Kessler blamed the failure of the Senegal project on the way African Agriculture's public offering was structured. He said there were no plans for a public offering this time.",
      "He claimed his new company's project would double corn production in these countries, and described African Food Security as the \u201cmost incredibly important development company on the planet.\u201d He said they have started to grow corn on 200 hectares in Cameroon.",
      "Experts who looked over the prospectus raised concerns about its claims, including an unusually high projection for corn yields. Kessler rejected those concerns.",
      "\u201cWhen he was CEO of African Agriculture, Kessler also made lofty claims about food production, job creation, exports and investment returns that did not pan out,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Vellv\u00e9, co-founder of GRAIN, a Spain-based nonprofit for land rights.",
      "Hype without proof was a key strategy for African Agriculture, said its former chief operating officer, Javier Orellana, who said he is owed 165,000 euros ($178,000) in unpaid salary after leaving the company in 2023.",
      "He told the AP he had been suspicious of the company\u2019s $450 million valuation.",
      "\u201cI know the agriculture industry well and ($450 million) didn\u2019t add up,\u201d Orellana said, adding he stayed on because the company gave him what he called a very attractive offer.",
      "In the end, a share in African Agriculture is now worth less than a penny.",
      "\u201cWe are looking forward to going back to Senegal,\u201d Kessler said. \"We were appreciated there. We\u2019ve been welcomed back there.\u201d",

      "The United States sanctioned six Chinese and Hong Kong officials who it alleged were involved in \u201ctransnational repression\u201d and acts that threaten to further erode the southern Chinese city\u2019s autonomy",
      "HONG KONG -- The United States sanctioned six Chinese and Hong Kong officials who it alleged were involved in \u201ctransnational repression\u201d and acts that threaten to further erode the city's autonomy, with China threatening to take countermeasures.",
      "The six officials included Justice Secretary Paul Lam, security office director Dong Jingwei and police commissioner Raymond Siu.",
      "The sanctions are expected to further escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing, who are already locked in friction over trade tariffs and other issues like Taiwan.",
      "\u201cBeijing and Hong Kong officials have used Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially to intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists who were forced to flee overseas, including a U.S. citizen and four other U.S. residents,\u201d the U.S. State Department said.",
      "The statement dated Monday said the six officials sanctioned were linked to entities or actions that engaged in coercing, arresting, detaining or imprisoning individuals under the authority of the city's security law, or implementing the law.",
      "The other three affected officials were Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the city's committee for safeguarding national security, and Dick Wong and Margaret Chiu, both assistant commissioners of the police.",
      "Since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 to quell the 2019 massive anti-government protests, Hong Kong authorities have prosecuted many leading activists in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "The crackdown has drawn criticism from foreign governments, especially because the city was promised that its Western-style civil liberties and semi-autonomy would be kept intact for at least 50 years during the 1997 handover. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Over the past two years, Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants for 19 activists based overseas, with bounties of $1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,536) for information leading to each of their arrests. The affected activists included former pro-democracy lawmakers Nathan Law and Ted Hui. They also canceled the passports of some of the overseas-based activists under a new security law introduced to the city last year.",
      "The Hong Kong office of China's foreign ministry condemned the sanctions, saying they again exposed the ill-intention of the U.S. to undermine the city's prosperity and contain China's development. It urged Washington to stop interfering in the city's affairs.",
      "\u201cChina will surely take effective countermeasures against these despicable acts by the U.S.!\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China would take resolute countermeasures for any wrong actions by the U.S. He argued the actions taken by Hong Kong police against \u201canti-China elements\u201d who fled abroad were carried out according to the law and that the U.S. has no right to interfere with the city's national security cases.",
      "The Hong Kong government strongly condemned the U.S. for the sanctions, saying it despises them and is not intimidated by them.",
      "\u201cIt, once again, clearly exposed the U.S.\u2019 barbarity under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent tactics in bullying and coercing various countries and regions,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "It said the \u201cabsconders\u201d mentioned by the U.S. government are wanted for arrest because they continued to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security overseas. It said the U.S. has given cover for those \u201cwho have committed these evil deeds,\" and therefore it was necessary for the city to take lawful measures to combat the acts.",
      "\u201cThe imposition of the so-called \u2018sanctions\u2019 in the guise of defending human rights and democracy indeed constitute a demonstration of shameless hypocrisy with double standards on the part of the U.S.,\u201d it said.",
      "Lam, the justice secretary, said the sanctions do not affect him. \u201cThey do not affect my work; they do not affect my life.\u201d",
      "He said the sanctions represented \u201cblatant tyrannical bullying intended to deter people from participating in safeguarding national security\" in a statement.",
      "But Frances Hui, one of the overseas-based activists targeted by the authorities, wrote on X that it was a critical step in addressing the city's worsening crackdown. She said they hoped it marked the beginning of a sustained effort to hold perpetrators accountable.",
      "The latest U.S. sanctions were not the first related to the city. During Donald Trump's first presidential term, his government also imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials for undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.",
      "In 2021, the U.S. slapped more sanctions on officials over Beijing\u2019s crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city under former U.S. President Joe Biden administration.",

    "story": [
      "The Tennessee Valley Authority has promoted one of its top executives to CEO as President Donald Trump has begun turning his attention back to the nation's largest public utility",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The nation's largest public utility on Monday promoted one of its top executives to CEO, putting Don Moul in charge of the Tennessee Valley Authority as President Donald Trump has cast renewed attention on the federal entity.",
      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty wrote a guest column arguing that the TVA board was bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular reactor with studies and hurdles.",
      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",
      "A TVA spokesperson has said Lyash's retirement was not related to the administration or current politics and that Lyash had begun talking to TVA board members last fall about considering retirement.",

    "story": [
      "Real estate, high-yield bonds, and cryptocurrency don\u2019t always live up to their reputation as portfolio diversifiers",
      "Diversification is a core principle of sound investing: A portfolio that includes assets with different performance characteristics often leads to better risk-adjusted returns than one that relies on a single asset class.",
      "But building a diversified portfolio can be easier in theory than practice, as many asset classes often touted as good portfolio diversifiers may not live up to their reputation.",
      "In some past periods, real estate investment trusts didn\u2019t move closely in tandem with the broader US equity market.",
      "Rolling three-year correlations have dropped as low as 0.10 during some periods, such as the early 2000s. And being untethered to the overall equity market can lead to better risk-adjusted returns when real estate is added to a diversified portfolio.",
      "In recent years, however, real estate has generally moved more in line with stocks overall. This has also made it a less valuable cushion against bear-market declines.",
      "Real estate had previously held up better than the overall market during some market corrections, such as the tech-stock correction that started in early 2000. But during the three most recent bear markets, real estate suffered heavier-than-average losses.",
      "High-yield bonds (also known as junk bonds) are issued by corporations with below-average credit ratings, generally defined as BB+ or lower from a major credit rating agency.",
      "As a result, they tend to trade more in line with broad credit markets, overall economic trends, and company-specific factors than they do with Treasuries. As a result, they\u2019re less sensitive to interest-rate movements than investment-grade bonds, which means they can provide diversification benefits within the bond portion of a portfolio.",
      "At the same time, though, high-yield bonds have a relatively high correlation with stocks. They typically suffer during periods of weaker economic growth, which are also negative for stocks.",
      "Granted, high-yield bonds have historically provided some protection from market drawdowns. However, Treasuries have done a much better job of cushioning downside risk.",
      "As an asset that exists purely in digital form, cryptocurrency is fundamentally different from other major asset classes.",
      "Bitcoin still accounts for most of the investor interest and assets, but numerous digital currencies have also attracted more attention from both retail and institutional investors over the past couple of years.",
      "As a nontraditional asset, cryptocurrency has had an extremely low correlation with most other major asset classes.But there are two reasons crypto may not make the best portfolio diversifier.",
      "First, as digital assets have attracted more interest from mainstream investors, correlations have steadily trended up in recent years.",
      "Second, crypto\u2019s potential diversification value has been overshadowed by its extreme performance swings. Instead of acting like a noncorrelated asset, digital assets are mainly defined by their extreme volatility. Over the past three years, bitcoin has been nearly 4 times as volatile as stocks. Much of this volatility has been on the upside, but bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have also been subject to extreme drawdown risk.",
      "The three examples discussed above underscore two of the limitations of correlation metrics. First, correlations can change over time, meaning that assets that were once great diversifiers may no longer be so. And second, even assets that still have a relatively low correlation coefficient may still be subject to above-average downside risk.",

      "President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades. The \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs that he is expected to announce Wednesday are likely to create chaos for global businesses and conflict with America\u2019s allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Since the 1960s, tariffs \u2014 or import taxes \u2014 have emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump wants to seize the process.",
      "\u201cObviously, it disrupts the way that things have been done for a very long time,\u2019\u2019 said Richard Mojica, a trade attorney at Miller & Chevalier. \u201cTrump is throwing that out the window ... Clearly this is ripping up trade. There are going to have to be adjustments all over the place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Pointing to America\u2019s massive and persistent trade deficits \u2013 not since 1975 has the U.S. sold the rest of the world more than it\u2019s bought -- Trump charges that the playing field is tilted against U.S. companies. A big reason for that, he and his advisers say, is because other countries usually tax American exports at a higher rate than America taxes theirs.",
      "Trump has a fix: He\u2019s raising U.S. tariffs to match what other countries charge.",
      "And he's expected to roll out his reciprocal tariffs \u2014 possibly along with unknown details about other import taxes \u2014 on Wednesday April 2. He's taken to calling the date \"Liberation Day'' because his protectionist policies aim to free the U.S. economy from dependence on foreign goods.",
      "The president is an unabashed tariff supporter. He used them liberally in his first term and is deploying them even more aggressively in his second. Since returning to the White House, he has slapped 20% tariffs on China, unveiled a 25% tax on imported cars and trucks set to take effect Thursday, effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and imposed levies on some goods from Canada and Mexico, which he may expand this week.",
      "Economists don't share Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs. They're a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. But it's possible that Trump's reciprocal tariff threat could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.",
      "\u201cIt could be win-win,\u201d said Christine McDaniel, a former U.S. trade official now at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. \u201cIt\u2019s in other countries\u2019 interests to reduce those tariffs.\u201d",
      "She noted that India has already cut tariffs on items from motorcycles to luxury cars and agreed to ramp up purchases of U.S. energy.",
      "They sound simple: The United States would raise its tariff on foreign goods to match what other countries impose on U.S. products.",
      "\u201cIf they charge us, we charge them,\u2019\u2019 the president said in February. \u201cIf they\u2019re at 25, we\u2019re at 25. If they\u2019re at 10, we\u2019re at 10. And if they\u2019re much higher than 25, that\u2019s what we are too.\u2019\u2019",
      "But the White House didn\u2019t reveal many details. It has directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to deliver a report this week about how the new tariffs would actually work.",
      "Among the outstanding questions, noted Antonio Rivera, a partner at ArentFox Schiff and a former attorney with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is whether the U.S. is going to look at the thousands of items in the tariff code \u2013 from motorcycles to mangos -- and try to level the tariff rates out one by one, country by country. Or whether it will look more broadly at each country\u2019s average tariff and how it compares to America. Or something else entirely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a very, very chaotic environment,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to plan in any sort of long-term, sustainable way.\u2019\u2019",
      "America\u2019s tariffs are generally lower than those of its trading partners. After World War II, the United States pushed for other countries to lower trade barriers and tariffs, seeing free trade as a way to promote peace, prosperity and American exports around the world. And it mostly practiced what it preached, generally keeping its own tariffs low and giving American consumers access to inexpensive foreign goods.",
      "Trump has broken with the old free trade consensus, saying unfair foreign competition has hurt American manufacturers and devastated factory towns in the American heartland. During his first term, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and almost everything from China. Democratic President Joe Biden largely continued Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.",
      "The White House has cited several examples of especially lopsided tariffs: Brazil taxes ethanol imports, including America\u2019s, at 18%, but the U.S. tariff on ethanol is just 2.5%. Likewise, India taxes foreign motorcycles at 100%, America just 2.4%.",
      "The higher foreign tariffs that Trump complains about weren\u2019t sneakily adopted by foreign countries. The United States agreed to them after years of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round, which ended in a trade pact involving 123 countries.",
      "As part of the deal, the countries could set their own tariffs on different products \u2013 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another. So the high tariffs Trump complains about aren\u2019t aimed at the United States alone. They hit everybody.",
      "Trump\u2019s grievances against U.S. trading partners also come at an odd time. The United States, running on strong consumer spending and healthy improvements in productivity, is outperforming the world\u2019s other advanced economies. The U.S. economy grew nearly 9% from just before COVID-19 hit through the middle of last year \u2014 compared with just 5.5% for Canada and just 1.9% for the European Union. Germany's economy shrank 2% during that time.",
      "Not satisfied with scrambling the tariff code, Trump is also going after other foreign practices he sees as unfair barriers to American exports. These include subsidies that give homegrown producers an advantage over U.S. exports; ostensible health rules that are used to keep out foreign products; and loose regulations that encourage the theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property.",
      "Figuring out an import tax that offsets the damage from those practices will add another level of complexity to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff scheme.",
      "The Trump team is also picking a fight with the European Union and other trading partners over so-called value-added taxes. Known as VATs, these levies are essentially a sales tax on products that are consumed within a country\u2019s borders. Trump and his advisers consider VATs a tariff because they apply to U.S. exports.",
      "Yet most economists disagree, for a simple reason: VATs are applied to domestic and imported products alike, so they don't specifically target foreign goods and haven't traditionally been seen as a trade barrier.",
      "And there\u2019s a bigger problem: VATs are huge revenue raisers for European governments. \u201cThere is no way most countries can negotiate over their VAT ... as it is a critical part of their revenue base,\u2019\u2019 Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, posted on X.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics, says that the top 15 countries that export to the U.S. have average VATs topping 14%, as well as duties of 6%. That would mean U.S. retaliatory tariffs could reach 20% \u2014 much higher than Trump's campaign proposal of universal 10% duties.",
      "Trump and some of his advisers argue that steeper tariffs would help reverse the United States' long-standing trade deficits.",
      "But tariffs haven't proven successful at narrowing the trade gap: Despite the Trump-Biden import taxes, the deficit rose last year to $918 billion, second-highest on record.",
      "The deficit, economists say, is a result of the unique features of the U.S. economy. Because the federal government runs a huge deficit, and American consumers like to spend so much, U.S. consumption and investment far outpaces savings. As a result, a chunk of that demand goes to overseas goods and services.",
      "The U.S. covers the cost of the trade gap by essentially borrowing from overseas, in part by selling treasury securities and other assets.",
      "\u201cThe trade deficit is really a macroeconomic imbalance,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a UCLA economist and former Treasury official. \u201cIt comes from this lack of desire to save and this lack of desire to tax. Until you fix those things, we\u2019ll run a trade imbalance.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The latest season of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d featured a ton of popular music in its soundtrack",
      "NEW YORK -- When a couple decided to take their relationship further on the most recent season of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d the moment was soundtracked with a familiar song: Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Feather.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t a flash-in-the-pan musical surprise. The season was stacked with familiar needle drops \u2014 Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cHoly,\u201d Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cInto You,\u201d Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d \u2014 a gesture away from the little-known, sometimes generic pop songs that used to meet the show's most emotional moments.",
      "Show creator and Kinetic Content CEO Chris Coelen attributed the pivot to the show's anniversary.",
      "\u201cWe decided, in this Season 8, to coincide with our fifth anniversary, to really embrace popular music in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, we ended up using \u2014 throughout the entire season and in every episode \u2014 we used popular music cues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d isn\u2019t the only reality show that walks the line between what viewers have labeled \u201creal songs\u201d and unfamiliar music.",
      "It\u2019s not artificial intelligence, where \u201cnobody controls the copyright,\u201d says \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d music supervisor Jody Friedman. \u201cThere\u2019s too much risk involved with using AI music in these projects.\u201d",
      "Excluding big-time pop records, the music used on television comes from a number of sources. It can be custom, original music by the show\u2019s composers. It can be licensed directly from artists, or from sync agents, production music libraries or a \u201cone stop,\u201d what supervisors call a company that has the rights to license both the master recording and the composition rights.",
      "Music supervisors might also turn to covers of well-known songs. On the most recent season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d Friedman used a cover of Phil Phillips\u2019 \u201cSea of Love,\u201d a classic \u201950s tune. It\u2019s more affordable to pay to license a cover than the original recording \u2014 \u201cand creatively, it\u2019s a modern take on an old song,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d music supervisor Sara Torres also uses covers.",
      "\u201cThat can bring in other listeners that may not necessarily be into pop, but if they hear the song in a different genre, it might pull them in, to go back and listen to the original version,\u201d she says.",
      "Music libraries \u2014 companies that represent music catalogs for licensing purposes \u2014 are key, too, because if a song is too expensive to license, a supervisor can instead find a song that evokes the feeling of BTS\u2019 \u201cButter\u201d without having to pay for it.",
      "\u201cThe indie libraries, let\u2019s say, for TV, could be anywhere from $1,000-1,500 per needle drop use,\u201d says Friedman. For TV shows in general, bigger commercial songs can range from $20,000 to upward of $100,000, with high-profile songs earning more depending on the use, he says.",
      "The use of instantly recognizable pop music differs from program to program.",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d has used popular music in the past, but sparingly. Coelen points out the use of Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance\u201d in Bliss Poureetezadi and Zack Goytowski\u2019s story in Season 4. But the frequency of Top 40 hits in the most recent season is new.",
      "He says the benefit of using these songs, creatively, is that it \u201celevates the experience,\u201d for the viewer: \u201cEmotions are so connected to certain pieces of music, and they can conjure up feelings that we relate to.\u201d",
      "Kinetic Content declined The Associated Press\u2019 request to speak with the show\u2019s music supervisor, Jon Ernst.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d featured songs like Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d and Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d in its most recent season. Executive producer James Barker points out that the original U.K. show has always used commercial music, and therefore the U.S. version has endeavored to do the same.",
      "\u201cThe show is meant to feel like you\u2019re on vacation with your best friends. Of course, when you\u2019re on vacation, you\u2019re sharing music,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that translates into how we create the show.\u201d",
      "Torres agrees. She adds that the show typically uses more commercial music in the beginning of the season, and then again in the finale \u2014 \u201cyou want that big impact.\u201d",
      "Because the show has a quick turnaround time, with six episodes a week \u2014 \u201cwhatever happens in Fiji on Monday airs Tuesday in America,\u201d as Barker describes it \u2014 the show team \u201cpre-clears\u201d over a thousand songs, just in case they work for a particular narrative moment. That means requests are sent out to publishers and labels ahead of time, but they're not paid for until the tracks are selected.",
      "A show with more lead time, \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has long used commercial songs in its programming. This year's season, the show's 29th, had several memorable musical moments, including a Cardi B, Bad Bunny and J Balvin needle drop when \u201cI Like It\u201d played as the cast made their way to Madrid.",
      "\u201cThis is my first season with \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 but historically they\u2019ve used Colbie Caillat, Boyz II Men, Backstreet Boys,\u201d lists Friedman. \u201cThey used Billie Eilish last season. This season we used a David Guetta track, Dropkick Murphys for the episode in Boston. There\u2019s a Karol G track.\u201d",
      "He adds \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d does use a lot of recognizable pop songs, typically one or two per episode.",
      "\u201cEach episode does have a budget. So, while they may splurge on a pop song, the rest of the budget\u201d is spent on other music that comes at a lower cost, he says.",
      "For \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d Coelen says simply: \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d",
      "Barker from \u201cLove Island USA\u201d agrees.",
      "\u201cNot only are you engaged with the characters, but the songs and artists that you care about listening to at home are being represented on television,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bridge between us all.\u201d",

      "Megha Ganne had a dream she would go low in the Augusta National Women's Amateur and she met reality in the opening round",
      "EVANS, Ga. -- Megha Ganne set the Augusta National Women's Amateur record on Wednesday with a 9-under 63 at Champions Retreat, giving her a two-shot lead over defending champion Lottie Woad, who did her best to track down Ganne.",
      "The scoring was lower than usual at Champions Retreat, where the opening two rounds are held before the top 30 who make the cut play the final round at Augusta National, which hosts the Masters next week.",
      "The weather was warm and turf was still relatively soft, and Ganne took advantage with a bogey-free round. Playing early and starting on the back, the Stanford junior ran off three straight birdies early and saved par with an 18-foot putt on the fifth hole, her 14th of the day.",
      "The only disappointment was a three-putt par on the par-5 ninth hole.",
      "\u201cBelieve it or not, I had a dream last night that I shot 61,\u201d Ganne said on Golf Channel. \u201cI didn't tell anyone. I didn't want to set bad omens in the air.\u201d",
      "And she nearly got there until the three-putt on her final hole, though Ganne had few complaints. Her 63 broke by two shots the mark previous held by Rose Zhang, her former Stanford teammate who won the ANWA two years ago.",
      "Woad more than held her own despite seeing such a low number on the board before she even made the turn.",
      "\u201cI saw she was at 9 under and thought I needed to get something going,\u201d Woad said.",
      "She had four birdies on the back nine, missing out on one chance at the par-5 14th but making up for that with a 45-foot birdie putt on the 15th.",
      "No one has won back to back since the ANWA began in 2019 and quickly became one of the premier amateur championships for women. That's largely because the entire field gets a practice round at the home of the Masters on Friday before those who make the cut play Augusta National for the title on Saturday.",
      "Anna Davis, who won the ANWA three years ago at age 16 and now plays at Auburn, said Ganne setting the tone early probably contributed to the low scoring. For most players, the goal is to make the cut and have a chance to compete at Augusta National.",
      "\u201cNow it's not, \u2018Want to make the cut.\u2019 It's just trying to catch her,\u201d Davis said after a 69.",
      "Kiara Romero, Farah O'Keefe and Amanda Sambach were each at 67. They were among 29 players in the 71-player field who broke par. U.S. Women's Amateur champion Rianne Malixi had to withdraw because of a back injury.",
      "Ganne is playing the ANWA for the fifth time, having advanced to the final round each of the last two years. She has been around long enough to realize there's still a long road ahead.",
      "\u201cEnjoy today and take the rest of the week as it comes,\u201d Ganne said. \u201cBut today was pretty special.\u201d",

      "The yearslong quest by Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez to acquire control of the Minnesota Timberwolves finally seems to be in the home stretch, after current owner Glen Taylor opted not to appeal an arbitration panel's ruling that he must go forward with the $1.5 billion sale.",
      "A person with knowledge of Taylor's decision confirmed it to The Associated Press on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Timberwolves had not offered any public comment. ESPN first reported the decision.",
      "All that appears to be left is final approval by the NBA's board of governors, which is the last step before any sale of a team can be completed. In February, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he didn't see any reason why that would not happen \u2014 but he also said the board would go through the full process as always.",
      "\u201cWe need to follow the process,\u201d Silver said at that time.",
      "The board of governors could vote at any time. It completed a two-day meeting in New York last week and likely wouldn't meet again until the summer, but it may not need to wait until then to give the sale its final blessing.",
      "Taylor, who turns 84 later this month, grew up on a Minnesota dairy farm and built a fortune with a business that specialized in printing wedding invitations. He bought the Timberwolves for $88 million in 1994 to prevent the franchise from moving to New Orleans.",
      "It was four years ago this month that he was approached by Lore, the former e-commerce chief for Walmart, and Rodriguez, the former baseball slugger who hit 696 home runs over 22 seasons with the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers.",
      "They quickly agreed on a $1.5 billion deal, and NBA prices have skyrocketed ever since. Last month, the Boston Celtics were sold for a record initial valuation of $6.1 billion \u2014 a number that may go even higher before that deal closes.",
      "During the contentious years while the sale was essentially pending, Lore and Rodriguez accused Taylor of having seller\u2019s remorse amid a steady rise in the value of NBA franchises.",

    "story": [
      "Paige Bueckers is widely expected to become the first WNBA No. 1 overall draft pick from the University of Connecticut since Breanna Stewart nine years ago",
      "Paige Bueckers is widely expected to become the first WNBA No. 1 overall draft pick from the University of Connecticut since Breanna Stewart nine years ago. Both became can\u2019t-miss stars in college, both are UConn icons, both went to four Final Fours.",
      "Stewart did it while making nothing. Bueckers, who has UConn in the Final Four for the second straight year, has done it while making millions. And she's far from the only one cashing in right now.",
      "There\u2019s no one-and-done path to the WNBA for women\u2019s players like there is for men, who can jump to the pros after one year of college regardless of age. Duke's standout freshman, Cooper Flagg, for example, is expected to go No. 1 in the NBA draft and he just turned 18 in December.",
      "The NBA and WNBA have different rules regarding draft eligibility. For years, that impeded how and when women\u2019s players could start making money. The name, image and likeness era of college sports has changed just about everything, leveling the playing field in some respects for female athletes like Bueckers and allowing her to have deals with Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors while still wearing UConn colors.",
      "\u201cI think Paige is the poster child for how it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work. She came out of high school at a time when people weren\u2019t just getting paid to play. \u2026 She made a name for herself and set a standard for exactly why you\u2019re supposed to be able to appreciate this stuff. You go to college. You\u2019re the best player in the country, and everybody wants to be associated with you, and the school doesn\u2019t give you a dime.\u201d",
      "To jump to the WNBA draft, players must either be a senior with all college eligibility exhausted or turn 22 in the draft year and renounce any remaining eligibility.",
      "Yet there is no clamoring to change the women\u2019s rules because, frankly, it wouldn\u2019t make much sense under the current salary structure. The No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft will make somewhere around $13.8 million in his rookie season. The No. 1 pick in this month\u2019s WNBA draft will make $78,831 in her rookie season.",
      "Staying in school isn\u2019t a bad thing for women\u2019s players. It\u2019s smart business. NIL deals will follow many of them to the WNBA. But the pro check isn\u2019t exactly a game changer for those at the top of the women\u2019s game. The top current WNBA base salary is around $242,000, though that's expected to increase with the recent financial boom in women's sports.",
      "Former Miami guards Haley and Hanna Cavinder became the first faces of the NIL era in college sports when it started on July 1, 2021, while they were still at Fresno State. They were immediately featured on a billboard in Times Square, the new faces of Boost Mobile. College sports were immediately changed.",
      "The Cavinder twins have built a multimillion-dollar fortune and have more than 7 million followers across their Instagram and TikTok accounts. They\u2019ve never confirmed actual numbers, but it's reasonable to believe the Cavinder twins are among the top-paid college athletes given both their earnings and equity stakes in various companies. Their college careers ended last month.",
      "\u201cI think we were pretty naive in the beginning with it, honestly,\u201d Haley Cavinder said. \u201cTo be transparent, I don\u2019t think Hanna and I really knew. We had talks of what NIL was, and I always saw tweets about it. But I never really envisioned myself getting paid or Hanna getting paid until July 1 happened. And then I was like, \u2018Wow, this is overwhelming.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know how much money there was.\u201d",
      "Olivia Miles, who starred at Notre Dame for four seasons, was widely expected to go between No. 2 and No. 4 in this month\u2019s WNBA draft. Instead, she decided to enter the transfer portal and play one last college season \u2014 taking her lucrative NIL deals with her wherever she ends up and missing out on the $78,000 WNBA payday for the 2025 season.",
      "Same goes for Southern California's JuJu Watkins, perhaps the most talented player in the women\u2019s game. Her season ended with a torn ACL in the NCAA Tournament, but her NIL deals will live on and could even grow by the time she returns to the court \u2014 presumably sometime next season. There\u2019s no urgency for her to go pro, since her earning stream already exists.",
      "Opendorse, a company that provides NIL services to dozens of schools, has data that might be shocking to some. It shows that top women\u2019s programs have a combined social media following that exceeds that of the top men\u2019s programs, which is a clear factor in determining NIL value.",
      "While the numbers of those engaging with top men\u2019s programs on social media skew about 4-to-1 male, it\u2019s close to a 50-50 split when charting those engaging with women\u2019s basketball stars and teams.",
      "\u201cFemale student-athletes are probably the most effective media buy in sports right now,\u201d Opendorse CEO Steve Denton said. \u201cAnd everything I see in the data tells me that, which is that their social audiences are three times as large as the average social audience. ... They\u2019re just better at it in terms of \u2014 they curate their social feeds better than the men do.\u201d",
      "The opportunities afforded by NIL were certainly a reason why Bueckers chose to stay in college. Same goes for Miles.",
      "It was one of the reasons why Kate Martin was in no hurry to leave Iowa and end her time as teammates with Caitlin Clark \u2014 who obviously played a major role in the explosion of women's basketball in recent years. Martin was in college for six years. When she got there, NIL didn\u2019t exist. When she left, people were paying money to wear things bearing her name.",
      "\u201cTo get my education paid for and then to be able to capitalize and make a little bit of money off of my NIL, I thought was huge,\u201d said Martin, who\u2019s going into her second WNBA season. \u201cAnd so that was one of the main reasons why I decided to stay.",
      "\"So, I don\u2019t blame people. You know, I would get made fun of because I was there for six years, but I didn\u2019t really care. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am right now if I didn\u2019t stay.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee has fired a coach and a director after The Associated Press reported that the coach was accused of sexually abusing a young biathlete, causing her so much distress that she attempted suicide.",
      "\u201cFollowing our thorough internal evaluation, we can confirm that Gary Colliander and Eileen Carey are no longer affiliated with the USOPC,\" spokesman Jon Mason told the AP. He refused to provide a reason, saying only that Colliander was put on administrative leave from the Paralympic team in December \u2014 days after the AP report on the alleged misconduct. The two were fired on March 14.",
      "Colliander was accused of sexually abusing Grace Boutot, a biathlete he coached at the Maine Winter Sports Center over four years beginning in 2006 when she was 15, the AP reported. Colliander quit the job after Boutot's October 2010 suicide attempt and was later hired by the U.S. Paralympic Nordic team.",
      "Carey was the Maine center's vice president at the time of the abuse and had discussed it with Boutot\u2019s mother. After leaving the center in December 2010, Carey was hired as a coach and later promoted to director of the Paralympic team. She was there when Colliander came onboard.",
      "Mason declined to say whether Carey hired Colliander or how the Paralympic team vets the coaches they hire. The U.S. Center for SafeSport, created to investigate sex-abuse allegations in Olympic sports in the aftermath of the Larry Nassar U.S. Gymnastics scandal, launched an investigation into Colliander in December.",
      "\u201cPlease note that Mr. Colliander\u2019s case remains active with SafeSport,\u201d Mason told the AP.",
      "Colliander's lawyer, Simone Montoya, said officials did not tell Colliander why he was fired and he \u201cadamantly denies any wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior, as alleged.\u201d",
      "Colliander \"is committed to full and transparent cooperation into this matter,\u201d Montoya told the AP in an email. \u201cHe denies any conduct in violation of the SafeSport Code or applicable laws and policies and maintains that he has always upheld professional standards throughout his career.\u201d",
      "AP phone and email messages seeking comment from Carey were not immediately returned.",
      "Boutot was among a half-dozen Olympians and other biathletes who came forward after the AP reported last year that Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually abused and harassed for years, according to SafeSport findings. Biathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual abuse except in cases where they publicly identify themselves or share their stories openly.",
      "Boutot, 34, told the AP that when Colliander began coaching her, he gave her a lot of attention, including inappropriate touching. The conduct escalated after she turned 18 to \u201ckissing, sexual fondling and oral sex,\u201d according to a treatment summary by her therapist, Jacqueline Pauli-Ritz, shared with the AP.",
      "Boutot said she begged Colliander to stop but he ignored her. She became severely depressed and started cutting herself, according to the therapist\u2019s notes. In September 2010, Pauli-Ritz contacted Colliander and told him Boutot was suffering from major depression and he should stop coaching her, the treatment summary said.",
      "\u201cHe did not do this until after the suicide attempt,\u201d Pauli-Ritz wrote, referring to Boutot\u2019s Oct. 7, 2010, overdose on antidepressants during a Utah training camp.",
      "Colliander resigned the next day. He took a coaching job in Colorado and was hired in December 2016 by the U.S. Paralympic team. He was associate director of high performance for U.S. Paralympics Nordic Skiing before being fired.",
      "Boutot tried to keep racing but faced discrimination by the center's staff and teammates, who blamed her for his departure, according to a letter she wrote to the Maine Sports Center's board in January 2011.",
      "Boutot's mother, Karen Gorman, had repeated discussions and email exchanges with Carey and the center's CEO, Andy Shepard, about the abuse her daughter suffered, Gorman told the AP.",
      "In an Oct. 22, 2010, email, Gorman told them, \u201cthe issue of any coach-athlete relationships ... must be scrutinized\" by the Maine sports center.",
      "Carey responded that she was \u201cworking really hard\u201d to make that happen. \u201cI am very supportive of having positive things come out of this situation for everyone involved,\u201d she said in an Oct. 25, 2010, email.",
      "But, Boutot told the AP, no investigation was ever conducted.",
      "In a 2011 complaint she filed with the Maine Human Rights Commission, Boutot accused the Maine sports center of failing to prevent Colliander\u2019s sexual misconduct and retaliating against her when she reported it \u2014 denying her coaching and ending financing of equipment, travel, athlete housing and other U.S. Biathlon competition-related expenses.",
      "The center settled for $75,000 in September 2011 and Boutot quit racing.",

      "Giannis Antetokounmpo told his Milwaukee Bucks teammates they were fighting for their lives",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Giannis Antetokounmpo told his Milwaukee Bucks teammates they were fighting for their lives.",
      "They responded by shooting for the highest single-game percentage by any team this century.",
      "Milwaukee snapped a four-game skid by shooting a franchise-record 68.9% (51 of 74) from the floor in a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night. According to Sportradar, no team had shot for that high a percentage in a game since March 13, 1998, when the Los Angeles Clippers shot 69.3% (61 of 88) in a 152-120 triumph over the Toronto Raptors.",
      "\u201cI kept saying to my teammates, \u2018We\u2019re fighting for our lives. We\u2019re fighting for our lives,\u2019 \" Antetokounmpo said. \u201cThey think I\u2019m joking, but I\u2019m not joking. We\u2019re fighting for our lives right here. Every win counts.\u201d",
      "The Bucks are sixth in the Eastern Conference standings and on track for their lowest playoff seed since 2018. They were coming off a 145-124 loss to Atlanta in which they allowed the most points they\u2019d given up all season. They don\u2019t know when \u2014 or if \u2014 seven-time all-NBA guard Damian Lillard will return from the deep vein thrombosis in his right calf that has him taking blood-thinning medication.",
      "So they needed a win badly. They responded by making shot after shot.",
      "Each of the eight Bucks who took the floor Tuesday shot at least 50%. Antetokounmpo had 37 points, 11 assists and six rebounds while shooting 12 of 18, but he wasn\u2019t a one-man gang.",
      "Ryan Rollins shot 8 of 10 overall and 5 of 7 from 3-point range while scoring 23 points. Brook Lopez celebrated his 37th birthday by shooting 10 of 13 and scoring 22 points. The Bucks made a season-high 58.6% of their 3-point attempts (17 of 29).",
      "\u201cI think we were a bit disappointed in our offense the past few games,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI think we got back to moving it, sharing it, trusting it, really taking advantage of our size in transition, getting the ball into the paint and just playing off that.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo, as usual, led the way.",
      "\u201cI knew coming into this game, whenever I see cracks, I\u2019ve got to take them because I\u2019m not going to have a lot of opportunities to be aggressive,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t have cracks, probably somebody\u2019s going to be wide open, so I\u2019ve just got to look to the right or the left of me and make the right play.\u201d",
      "As well as the Bucks shot the ball, they nearly blew a 21-point, second-half advantage. Phoenix had reduced the margin to four points before Rollins hit a 3-pointer with 1:09 left to get the Bucks out of danger.",
      "Phoenix stayed close because Milwaukee committed 20 turnovers. The Suns took 18 more shots than the Bucks and outscored them 24-3 in second-chance points.",
      "\u201cMy gut is they had one of those nights,\u201d Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cI thought defensively our effort, our (will to) compete was at a very high level. \u2026 The basket was big for them tonight.\u201d",
      "The Bucks followed a similar script Sunday, when they shot 69% in the first half but still trailed 82-75 at the break because of their eight turnovers and struggles on defense.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so close to being an incredible offensive team,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cWe shoot 70% the first half the other night. We shot 68.9 tonight. If we can rebound the ball and take care of the ball, we\u2019ve got a chance to break out and make a hell of a run here. We really do.\u201d",
      "At least this time, the Bucks found a way to win \u2014 even if it took a record performance.",
      "\u201cI definitely needed a win,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI think when you win, you enjoy your sleep better. You enjoy your food better. You enjoy spending time with your kids and everything better. You enjoy interacting with your teammates more. I\u2019m a sore loser. I\u2019m not going to lie. We definitely needed a win.\u201d",

      "The one-year trial version of the dynamic kickoff in the NFL led to an uptick in the return rate that wasn\u2019t quite as much as the league had hoped",
      "The one-year trial version of the dynamic kickoff in the NFL led to an uptick in the return rate that wasn't quite as much as the league had hoped.",
      "Now the new form of the kickoff that is more like a scrimmage play is permanent with a change for 2025 that the league hopes will lead to a significant increase in returns.",
      "Owners voted Tuesday to move touchbacks on kicks from the 30 to the 35 in hopes that more teams will kick the ball in play instead of giving up an extra 5 yards of field position.",
      "The league also approved changes to the overtime rule, expanded replay assist and made a few other technical changes at the league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Here\u2019s an explanation of some of the new rules that will be in place.",
      "The league was mostly pleased with the experimental kickoff put in place for 2024 that led to the rate of kickoff returns increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season, while reducing the rate of injuries on what had been the game's most dangerous play.",
      "The rule made kickoffs more like scrimmage plays by placing the coverage players and blockers close together to eliminate the high-speed collisions that had contributed to so many injuries on the play. The league said the rate of concussions dropped 43% on returns with a significant reduction as well on lower-body injuries.",
      "The problem last season was many teams still opted to kick the ball in the end zone because the touchback wasn't punitive enough with the average starting field position on a touchback being only 2.4 further than the average starting position after returns that was the 27.6-yard line.",
      "By moving the touchback to the 35, the league projects that the return rate will rise to somewhere between 60% and 70% with a similar increase in long returns, adding more excitement to the game.",
      "The league also approved a small tweak to how how blockers on the return team are allowed to line up in the setup zone that could lead to longer returns.",
      "The league approved a proposal to make regular season overtime more like the postseason with both teams getting a chance at a possession, even if the team that got the ball first scored a touchdown.",
      "The NFL added regular season overtime in 1974, adding a 15-minute sudden death period that ended on any score. In 2010, the rule was tweaked to a \u201cmodified\u201d sudden death that required an opening possession touchdown to immediately end the game instead of only a field goal in both the regular season and playoffs.",
      "Overtime then was shortened for the regular season to only 10 minutes in 2017. A rule change in 2022 for the playoffs only gave both teams the chance to score even with a touchdown on the opening possession.",
      "Now that will be the case in the playoffs, after the improved field position on kickoffs made winning in OT on an opening possession TD easier.",
      "According to Sportradar, six of the 16 overtime games last season ended on an opening drive TD for the most overtime games ended on the first drive since the rule change went into effect in 2010.",
      "In all, teams that won the overtime toss won 75% of the time last season, according to Sportradar, and have a .606 winning percentage in overtime since it was cut to 10 minutes.",
      "The league kept the 10-minute overtime period instead of expanding it back to 15 minutes like was originally proposed by Philadelphia, which could lead teams opting to go for 2 and a win if they match an opening drive TD with one of their own since there might not be time for another possession.",
      "The NFL expanded its replay assist system to overturn objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles, tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. Replay also would be able to overturn a roughing-the-kicker or running-into-the-kicker penalty if video showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The league has been using replay assist in recent years to overturn obvious errors on aspects like whether a pass is caught or where the ball should be spotted without the referee needing to stop the game for a review.",
      "The Competition Committee says there's no interest in allowing replay assists to call penalties on plays missed by officials on the field.",
      "There were a few procedural rules changed. Teams will now by able to conduct Zoom or phone meetings with prospective free agents during the so-called legal tampering period.",
      "Teams can place two players on injured reserve with the designation to return when rosters are reduced to 53 players instead of after. Playoff teams also will be granted two additional return from IR designations.",
      "A proposal by Green Bay to outlaw the tush push that Philadelphia has used so successfully was tabled until the May meetings. A vote on a proposal to tweak the onside kick rule also was delayed until May, along with a proposal by Detroit to change the playoff seeding to place wild-card teams ahead of a division winner with a worse record.",

      "NEW YORK -- Detroit's Isaiah Stewart was suspended for two games and four other players from the Pistons and Minnesota Timberwolves drew one-game suspensions for their roles in an on-court altercation between the teams earlier this week, the NBA said Tuesday.",
      "Stewart got two games \u201cbased in part on his repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts,\u201d the league said.",
      "The NBA handed the one-game bans to Detroit's Ron Holland II and Marcus Sasser along with Minnesota's Naz Reid and Donte DiVincenzo. All five of those players were ejected from Sunday's game, as were Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff and Minnesota assistant Pablo Prigioni.",
      "\u201cObviously things went too far,\u201d Bickerstaff said after that game. \u201cBut what you see is guys looking out for one another, guys trying to protect one another, guys trying to have each other\u2019s backs. ... Those are nonnegotiables in our locker room.\u201d",
      "The incident began when Holland fouled Reid with 8:36 left in the second quarter of the Timberwolves\u2019 123-104 victory over the Pistons in Minneapolis.

      "Stewart and Sasser then entered the altercation, \u201cwhich resulted in a continued escalation of the situation,\u201d the league said.",
      "Reid and DiVincenzo will serve their one-game suspensions Tuesday when the Timberwolves visit Denver. Stewart will begin serving his suspension Wednesday when the Pistons visit Oklahoma City, and Holland and Sasser also will serve their suspensions in that game.",

      "The future of the \u201ctush push\u201d should be decided on Tuesday following debates about the safety of a play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another",
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The future of the \u201ctush push\u201d should be decided on Tuesday following debates about the safety of a play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another.",
      "NFL owners are set to vote on Green Bay\u2019s proposal to ban the play along with other potential rules changes, including playoff seeding and kickoffs.",
      "Even though the league has said there haven\u2019t been any injuries reported as a result of the \u201ctush push,\u201d the potential risk involved in Philadelphia\u2019s version of the quarterback sneak has sparked intense discussions.",
      "The Packers, who lost to the Eagles in a wild-card playoff game, also cited pace of a play as a reason to consider eliminating the play. Rams coach Sean McVay is against it. Los Angeles also lost to Philadelphia in the playoffs. Bills coach Sean McDermott is leading the push to get rid of it even though Buffalo used it more than any team other than the Eagles.",
      "It\u2019ll take 24 of 32 votes to approve the ban.",
      "\u201cI feel where I\u2019m most concerned is, even though there is not significant data out there to this point, my biggest concern is the health and safety of the players, first and foremost,\u201d McDermott said at the league meetings on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s two things. It\u2019s force, added force, No. 1, and then the posture of the players, being asked to execute that type of play, that\u2019s where my concern comes in. ... I\u2019m not a doctor. I\u2019m not going to get too deep into that situation there, in terms of how much data, how much sample. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really always the best way to go. There is other data out there that suggests when you\u2019re in a posture like we\u2019re talking about, that can lead to serious injury. I think being responsible and proactive in that regard is the right way to go.\u201d",
      "The Eagles began using the play in short-yardage situations in 2022. Two or three players line up behind quarterback Jalen Hurts and push him forward. Several other teams, including the Bills, began using it but no team has matched Philadelphia\u2019s success rate.",
      "\u201cTough play to stop but then you\u2019re listening to that and the medical side and you probably could go either way with it,\u201d said Chiefs coach Andy Reid, whose team lost 40-22 to the Eagles in the Super Bowl. \u201cBut I would say if it\u2019s putting a player in a bad position, then you probably have to do something about it. But if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a heck of a play.\u201d",
      "Other changes include making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and overhauling the playoff format.",
      "The NFL competition committee has recommended sticking with the kickoff rule that was redesigned last year and tweaking it to move touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The Detroit Lions proposed that playoff seeding should be based on record instead of automatically placing division winners in the top four spots.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",

      "The Boston Celtics will almost certainly connect on a history-making 3-pointer sometime this week. It should be Wednesday against the Miami Heat. If not, then it'll be Friday against the Phoenix Suns.",
      "It's coming. It's inevitable.",
      "This year's Celtics \u2014 the defending NBA champions \u2014 will go into the playoffs having set league records for 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted in a season.",
      "Everybody knows the Celtics shoot a ton of 3-pointers; they have taken at least 50 3s in a game 36 times this season \u2014 and they're a whopping 29-7 in those games after trying 62 of them in a win over Memphis on Monday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of taking what the defense gives you,\u201d Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.",
      "Boston is now the first team in NBA history to take 60 3s in a game five times in the same season. They're up to 1,344 made 3s this season, now just 19 away from matching the record Golden State set two seasons ago \u2014 so that's within realistic reach against the Heat on Wednesday. They've tried 3,636 3s this season, 85 away from the record Houston set in 2018-19.",
      "This has been a talking point in the league for years. How many 3s are too many 3s?",
      "The Celtics don\u2019t care. Evidently, neither do about half of the other teams in the NBA.",
      "Boston is one of 15 clubs poised this season to break franchise records in either 3-pointers made, 3-pointers attempted, or both. Some teams \u2014 Chicago, Cleveland, Portland and San Antonio \u2014 have already set one or both of those club records with two weeks left in the season.",
      "Let's take a look inside the numbers:",
      "Now past 30,000 made 3s for the fourth consecutive season \u2014 James Harden made the 30,000th on Sunday \u2014 the NBA is on pace to smash the current total records for 3-pointers made and attempted in a season.",
      "The league record of 31,579 made 3s was set last season and the record of 86,535 attempted was set in the 2021-22 season. At the current pace, 33,000 made 3s is within reach and 92,000 of them getting attempted isn't impossible either.",
      "It'll be the 17th time in the last 22 seasons that the NBA has seen more 3s than ever before.",
      "Teams are trying 6.8% more 3-pointers, on average, than they did last season. This would be the biggest year-over-year jump in the last six seasons.",
      "Translation: The 3-point craze is not ending anytime soon.",
      "If you've paid any attention this season, you know this isn't just the Celtics going wild from deep. Almost every team is shooting 3s at a dizzying rate \u2014 with Chicago simply obliterating its team record.",
      "The Bulls had never made more than 941 3s in a season; they're at 1,171 already this season. They're on pace for massive increases over last season \u2014 up 36% increase in 3s made, up 32% in 3s attempted over a year ago.",
      "Also currently on pace to break club records for 3s made, attempted or both in a season: Boston, Brooklyn, Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, the Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis, Miami, Minnesota, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio and Washington.",
      "It's not for everyone. Houston is on pace for the eighth-most 3s made and attempted in a season; to be fair, the Rockets of a few years ago were of the go-go-go, shoot-shoot-shoot mold, and this team is not. Dallas and Milwaukee are both on pace for only the seventh-most 3s attempted in any of their seasons.",
      "The record number of players making 100 3-pointers in a season is 125, set last season. It could be topped; entering Monday, 118 players had at least 100 3s this season.",
      "Let's put this into more perspective: A decade ago \u2014 2014-15 \u2014 there were only 57 players to make 100 3-pointers.",
      "That number has more than doubled since.",
      "Making 10 3s doesn't guarantee winning \u2014 but not making at least 10 3s in a game puts teams in serious trouble.",
      "Entering Monday, teams that don't make at least 10 3-pointers lose 72% of the time this season. Teams that don't make at least 15 3-pointers lose 59% of the time.",
      "Teams that make 15 or more 3s in a game win 65% of the time. Here's a weird quirk, though: Making 20 or more 3s in a game has led to victory 74% of the time this season \u2014 which is actually down from 83% last season, 82% in 2022-23 and 91% in 2021-22.",
      "Not everyone is part of the 3-point craze.",
      "There are four players \u2014 the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Ivica Zubac, Detroit\u2019s Jalen Duren, Minnesota\u2019s Rudy Gobert and Dallas\u2019 Daniel Gafford \u2014 who have at least 500 points this season and have yet to try a 3-point shot.",
      "Cleveland\u2019s Jarrett Allen (0 for 4 on 3-pointers), Charlotte\u2019s Mark Williams (0 for 1), New Orleans\u2019 Yves Missi (0 for 1) and Phoenix\u2019s Nick Richards (0 for 2) were close to being on that list.",
      "Oklahoma City\u2019s Isaiah Hartenstein is over the 500-point threshold \u2014 but is 0 for 18 on 3s this season. Only three players have ever tried more 3s in a season without a make; Gene Banks was 0 for 19 in 1985-86, Magic Johnson was 0 for 21 in 1982-83 and Tom Garrick was 0 for 22 in 1990-91.",

    "summary": "In Wayne Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, and across Canada, the Great One's loyalty and legacy are being questioned at a time the nation's independence is being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump",
    "story": [
      "In Wayne Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, and across Canada, the Great One's loyalty and legacy are being questioned at a time the nation's independence is being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "BRANTFORD, Ontario -- John Davidson has difficulty remembering the last time Wayne Gretzky visited his childhood home across the street in this small city a couple hours' drive southwest of Toronto.",
      "The modestly plain house with a one-car garage in a quiet residential neighborhood remains in the family, but the Great One\u2019s visits have been fewer and farther between, especially since his beloved father Walter died in 2021. The backyard ice rink where Gretzky developed his generational talent has since been replaced by a pool.",
      "Now 85, Davidson still chases away the occasional curiosity seeker, a far cry from the days when busloads of children would pull up, or the time Wayne and his wife Janet showed up with an entourage, three limousines strong. The retired steelworker then lowered his hand to his knee to indicate how long he's known Gretzky, before saying: \u201cWayne\u2019s changed a lot since he went down to the States.\u201d",
      "Like many in this city of 105,000 and across a nation of 39 million, Davidson has difficulty squaring the child he once knew, the player who won four Stanley Cups in Edmonton and re-wrote the NHL\u2019s scoring records, and the person he sees now.",
      "At 64, Gretzky is now the subject of a once-unimaginable debate over his loyalty to his native Canada due to his ties to President Donald Trump, whose brazen comments about the nation's sovereignty have angered Canadians.",
      "Pictures of Gretzky celebrating Trump\u2019s election night victory at Mar-a-Lago and attending his inauguration don\u2019t sit well at a time Canadians face an existential crisis in the wake of rising tariffs and the president\u2019s comments about turning its northern neighbor into a 51st state. Many find it unsettling that Gretzky is silent on the topic, even with Trump suggesting Gretzky run for office for the eventuality of becoming the nation\u2019s governor once it joins the U.S.",
      "\u201cI always thought the hell out of him,\" Davidson said of Gretzky. \"Hate is a terrible word. Dislike is a better word.",
      "\u201cIt disappoints the hell out of me. And I don\u2019t think his father would appreciate it either,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of people are pissed off with him right now because he went and kissed the ring.\u201d",
      "Gretzky did not respond to messages seeking comment from The Associated Press for this story.",
      "Gretzky's on-ice exploits remain legendary and they begin at an early age. When he was 11, he scored 378 goals and 517 points in 85 games for the atom division Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers. By 13, he had already scored 1,000 goals, and was essentially chased out of Brantford by adults \u2014 even parents of his teammates \u2014 booing Gretzky for the attention he was generating.",
      "His parents relocated him to play in Toronto, before Gretzky made the jump to the Ontario Hockey League, where in his only full season in 1977-78 he scored 70 goals and piled up 182 points, which still ranks second on the league's list.",
      "Though he played on four NHL teams, ending his career with the New York Rangers in 1999, befitting his No. 99, Gretzky is best known for his 10 seasons in Edmonton, including his first when the Oilers played in the World Hockey Association. Gretzky became an icon in Alberta's capital for the championships and attention; his marriage to American actor Janet Jones in July 1988 was called \u201cThe Royal Wedding\u201d and broadcast live across Canada.",
      "Brantford is dubbed \u201cThe Telephone City\u201d for once being home to Alexander Graham Bell, but Gretzky\u2019s influence abounds. His charitable foundation provides for numerous local causes, including Special Olympics and distributing free hockey sticks to children.",
      "Inside the four-rink, two-swimming pool Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre is the region\u2019s sports hall of fame, featuring a large collection of the Great One\u2019s memorabilia. Outside is a statue of Gretzky raising the Stanley Cup with three smaller statues looking on, representing his parents and a young Gretzky wearing a Red Wings' Gordie Howe jersey.",
      "All this in honor of a person who has been gone for a majority of his life, and makes his home in the U.S. Of his five children, daughter Paulina is best known for her marriage to top golfer Dustin Johnson. And while the Gretzkys are a far cry from the Kardashians, there is a Hollywood shine to the family that previously served as a mild curiosity to most Canadians.",
      "It's unclear when Gretzky and Trump became friends, though it likely revolves around golf.",
      "In the 1980s, Oilers players enjoyed occasional rounds of golf with Trump through his friendship with then-franchise owner Peter Pocklington. The relationship between Gretzky and the president likely grew stronger through Johnson, who has often golfed with Trump.",
      "Gretzky's ties with Trump might have raised a few curious head turns in the past, but never approached the turmoil it has reached today.",
      "Recently, CTV reported, the face of Gretzky's statue outside of the Edmonton Oilers arena had been smeared with feces, part of a polarizing debate that's raised ire among his detractors and eye-rolls from his defenders.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done so many good things in both of these countries, he doesn\u2019t need to explain himself to anybody,\u201d said Brantford councilor Dan McCreary, whose ward includes Gretzky sports complex. He referred to Gretzky's critics as being part of a \u201ccancel culture\u201d movement.",
      "Though no fan of the president, McCreary called it \u201ca deficit of leadership\u201d in equally blaming Trump and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the fallout.",
      "Not lost on McCreary is how Brantford sits in the crosshairs of the cross-border dispute. The city serves as a transportation hub \u2014 a two-and-a-half-hour drive from three border crossings \u2014 and with a manufacturing base linked to the auto industry, now facing potential fallout from U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cYou might suggest that to him,\u201d McCreary said when asked if Gretzky could put in a good word to Trump about his hometown.",
      "The effects of the trade dispute and surge in patriotism are apparent in Brantford. Grocery stores highlight Canadian-made products \u2014 from soup to nuts and maple syrup \u2014 and provincially controlled liquor stores have removed all U.S. wines and whiskeys from their shelves.",
      "Meantime, the Gretzky name is everywhere. Bars feature signed posters. There's a Gretzky party room in a chain restaurant around the corner from his childhood home. There's the Wayne Gretzky Parkway, a winding five-mile, four-lane thoroughfare that's suddenly become a sticking point.",
      "A sense of national pride led to Kat Philp launching a petition to rename the road after Walter, who held the honorary title of Brantford's Lord Mayor for his extensive community work.",
      "The issue is not whose Wayne Gretzky's friends are \u2014 \u201cYou do you,\u201d Philp said. Instead, she feels betrayed by his failure to voice support for Canada.",
      "\u201cWe always felt he was still Canadian. We don\u2019t feel that way anymore,\" said Philp, 50, who grew up playing hockey, attended Gretzky\u2019s celebrity slow-pitch tournaments as a teenager and was proud in telling people she was from Gretzky's hometown.",
      "Pocklington, the former Oilers owner, is stunned by the backlash directed at someone he's known since purchasing the 17-year-old player\u2019s rights in 1978 and bringing him to Edmonton to usher in the franchise's heyday before trading him to Los Angeles.",
      "\"Wayne is not a politician. He\u2019s a hockey player. Period. And his heart has always been in Canada, with Canada,\u201d Pocklington said from his home in Desert Palm, California. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019d stand up in his own defense but I think he probably feels sorry for them more than anything.\u201d",
      "For all those defending Gretzky, including his wife Janet and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, what\u2019s notable, too, are those who haven\u2019t.",
      "Hockey Hall of Fame goalie Ken Dryden declined an interview request, writing \u201cThis is something Wayne Gretzky needs to think through,\u201d in an email to the AP. Canada-Russia 1972 Summit Series star Paul Henderson laughed, saying he stays out of politics. And there's not been a peep from Mark Messier, Gretzky's former teammate and current TV analyst.",
      "Hall of Fame goalie Dominik Hasek was among the exceptions as the debate over Gretzky\u2019s legacy lingers with Alex Ovechkin closing in on the Great One\u2019s NHL goal-scoring title.",
      "\u201cThe whole world saw Wayne at a party at the American President\u2019s home,\u201d Hasek wrote in a text to the AP from his home in the Czech Republic.",
      "\u201cIt is not surprising to me that Canadian people are asking about the attitude of a man who is a Canadian icon,\u201d Hasek added. \"To be honest, I am also interested in his attitude. He must know best why he does not express himself on this. Be sure to ask him.\u201d",

      "In basketball, where wood is still king, Thornton sees growth potential for glass courts \u2014 already showing up in the NBA and internationally \u2014 as a tech-driven alternative to the sport's long-running hardwood foundation.",
      "\u201cI use this analogy a lot: We\u2019re at the initial stages of the iPhone being launched,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cWay back when Apple did that, the design of the hardware has changed, but more importantly the original iPhone was just a phone, a text device and music player. Now you\u2019re running your entire life and communicating to the world on it. I see this in the same regard.\u201d",
      "It seems strange at first blush \u2014 big, strong athletes jumping and running across a court of glass while \u201cpounding the rock\u201d and even diving on the floor. That is a future ASB GlassFloor company envisions, citing technology improvements allowing for a safe and viable surface featuring stunning visuals that can be changed with a few swipes and taps of a smartphone or tablet app.",
      "Thornton said the glass surface has give and flexibility exceeding that of wood, aided by a spring-action design to the aluminum and steel framing beneath the LED paneling. There's also a ceramic coating with dots etched into the glass, offering grip, and a consistent surface without \u201cdead spots\u201d or other quirks that can occur with wood courts.",
      "That combination has the company touting enhanced safety potential for athletes, even in more easily spotting sweat to wipe up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a stigma about the glass: \u2018Oh my gosh, it\u2019s going to break, it\u2019s harder, people are going to break the glass, they\u2019re going to fall through it,\u2019\u201d Thornton said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite the opposite.\u201d",
      "The visuals are the bigger selling point. Arena managers could easily update a court's look instead of using space storing hardwood stacks for multiple designs and paying for labor to install or update them. Or coaches could set up their own practice regimens with on-court visual cues.",
      "And yes, a team could even opt for a hardwood-panel look in a nod to tradition.",
      "The trade-off? A bigger price tag than a wood counterpart. Thornton didn\u2019t specify an amount but pointed to potentially selling leases to the courts, saying the company has had \u201cadvanced\u201d talks with college teams and leagues.",
      "At Connor Sports, a Michigan-based company that makes the hardwood courts for the men's and women's Final Four, technical director Jason Gasperich referenced that higher cost. He noted that roughly 750 of the 800 courts his company typically builds and sells per year might end up in elementary and high schools \u201cwhere they just don't have the budget for that.\u201d",
      "Still, he also gave a tip of the cap to the technology.",
      "\u201cNonetheless, they're still super interesting, unique,\u201d Gasperich said. \u201cAnd there's things you can do with digital that you can't do with a traditional wood floor.\u201d",
      "Glass LED courts are already in home arenas for Bayern Munich in Germany and Panathinaikos Athens in Greece. They've also been used in events by governing body FIBA.",
      "In the U.S., Kentucky used one in October for its \u201cBig Blue Madness\u201d event marking the ceremonial season start for Wildcats basketball.",
      "\u201cI love everything about the versatility of this floor,\u201d men\u2019s coach Mark Pope said in video posted by ASB GlassFloor capturing reactions as players tested it out in Rupp Arena.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but it squeaks like a real basketball court,\u201d women\u2019s player Cassidy Rowe said in the video. \u201cIt just functions like a normal basketball court, but it\u2019s showing our picture, which is crazy.\u201d",
      "The NBA offered a showcase look during the 2024 NBA All-Star weekend, holding its skills competition, 3-point contest, dunk contest and shooting matchup between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu on one in Indianapolis.",
      "By December, the company had set up a training facility in Orlando allowing NBA teams in town to play the Magic a chance to workout on the glass court and offer feedback. Thornton, who said the NBA has bought a minority stake into the company's Americas division, estimated more than 100 players and coaches have tested it so far.",
      "\u201cAs we integrate with the other data providers in both the NCAA and NBA, we are only going to get better and better with what improving what you can do on an ASB GlassFloor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus now up to today has been getting a surface that is comfortable for the athletes to play on, and we\u2019ve done that.\"",

    "story": [
      "At least four states are considering giving college athletes tax breaks on endorsement income",
      "CHICAGO -- Illinois state Rep. Travis Weaver remembers how surreal it felt having Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram sit a few rows behind him in a political science class. He will never forget the pure joy in Alabama every time the Crimson Tide rolled to the national championship, either.",
      "Weaver was there for two title runs as a student from 2010 to 2015. The way he sees it, coach Nick Saban and his players weren't the only winners.",
      "\u201cThe city of Tuscaloosa, the state of Alabama, the employers who recruited the University of Alabama because there\u2019s higher-caliber students there -- they all benefited massively because of the success of the football team,\" Weaver said. \"Coach Saban made that a different school than when he got there. Obviously, the football team was better. But what I saw as a student was an entire community become much stronger because of that success.\u201d",
      "His college experience is driving the push he's now making.",
      "Weaver wants to give an assist to Illinois schools and entice more recruits to stay home by exempting up to $100,000 in name, image and likeness earnings from the state income tax. In Georgia and Alabama, lawmakers are looking to eliminate income tax on NIL earnings altogether. There's a similar push in Louisiana.",
      "Lawmakers see the legislation they are proposing as a way to level the hyper-competitive recruiting field if not gain an advantage. Their universities are going against schools from Florida, Tennessee and Texas, states where income is not taxed.",
      "The measures could face pushback from other students who make money off their name, image and likeness such as social media influencers, actors and musicians. They might wonder why the quarterback and point guard are getting an exemption but not them.",
      "There is precedent. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed a bill that eliminated the so-called federal \u201cvictory tax\u201d on Olympic medalists, preventing the IRS from collecting on medals and prize money up to $1 million. Then again, state lawmakers have to decide if the proposed measures are worth the potential challenges even if they're on solid legal footing.",
      "\u201cThe optics of it probably aren\u2019t great for people that are YouTubers, and some college kids are paying in-state tax and some aren\u2019t,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, a former IRS attorney now at Sullivan and Worcester in Boston. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a constitutional issue that would prevent it from happening.\u201d",
      "Attorney Michael Rueda of Withers Worldwide has worked with athletes and schools on NIL matters. He said states would \u201chave to make the argument that there\u2019s a legitimate rationale to distinguish between taxpayers.\u201d",
      "There are nine with no income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Though the idea of saving money might be attractive, accountants and attorneys who work with athletes and colleges say tax rates generally aren't at the top of their clients\u2019 priority lists. They look more at their role, the team's competitiveness and their marketing opportunities.",
      "In that sense, they're just like the pros.",
      "\u201cWhat seems to be the number one choice for them after you get past the money?\" said Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant at Eisner Advisory Group in New York who has worked with college and professional athletes. \"Because we have seen athletes turn down the highest-priced contract.\u201d",
      "As for a potential exemption on NIL income?",
      "\u201cCarson Beck -- did he go to (Miami) just to avoid Georgia income tax?\" said Michael Guariglia, an attorney with McCarter & English in New Jersey who has worked with colleges on NIL. \"I think it was more important to him to get the assurances that he was going to be their starting quarterback. Could it be a factor? Yeah, maybe. It plays into a lot of different things.\u201d",
      "Recruits from New Jersey, for example, who go to school in Florida still have to pay income tax in their state unless they change residence. And income for someone from Florida who goes to school in Jersey might still be exempt.",
      "Athletes in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and, maybe to a lesser extent, Illinois who choose to stay home would be in for a break if the legislation passes.",
      "In Georgia, where there's a flat rate of 5.39%, a recruit who stays in state would figure to save about $5,400 on $100,000 in NIL money. In Alabama \u2014 where it ranges from 2% to 5% for a single earner making more than $3,000 \u2014 the savings on $100,000 would be about $5,000. In Louisiana \u2014 which just implemented a flat 3% rate \u2014 that translates to $3,000.",
      "The savings for athletes making seven figures in NIL money would obviously be much more significant; in Illinois, not as much since Weaver's plan would exempt only the first $100,000.",
      "In that scenario, basketball or football players with their eyes on the NBA or NFL might still wind up paying state tax on at least a portion of their NIL earnings. Athletes with less lucrative deals might be completely covered and a little more inclined to stay in state as a result.",
      "To Weaver, it's more about helping the mid-major schools in the state such as Bradley, Illinois State, Western Illinois and Loyola Chicago than the Big Ten's Illinois and Northwestern.",
      "\u201cIf those schools are just a little bit more successful and you get that extra 10% bump in applications more periodically, they can help Peoria, Ill., Bloomington, Ill., Macomb, Ill.,\" said Weaver, a Republican from Peoria.",
      "Though Weaver said the state would lose about $750,000 in income tax revenue, he considers it a worthwhile investment. He envisions increases in enrollment, attendance at games, merchandise sales, hotel bookings and more that come with success on the court and field.",
      "Exhibit A: Loyola.",
      "The Jesuit school on Chicago's North Side saw big jumps in applications and merchandise sales following runs to the Final Four in 2018 and Sweet 16 in 2021. Sister Jean bobbleheads and maroon-and-gold scarves became popular items.",
      "\u201cIf we can help -- you pick the mid-major -- make the NCAA Tournament once every three years instead of once every five years, and that means twice as often they\u2019re getting that 10% boost in applications, that could be something that really is a difference maker in keeping one of those smaller schools afloat for the long term,\u201d Weaver said.",

      "BOSTON -- Maxim Naumov came to a stop in the middle of the ice, looked up at the sky and patted his heart. Then he mouthed a few words, in Russian, to his parents:",
      "\u201cThis is for you guys. You guys are with me. I love you both.\u201d",
      "Former world pairs champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova died in January when their plane crashed into a military helicopter on approach to Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River. A total of 67 people were killed, including more than two dozen who were returning from a development camp following the U.S. figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Maxim Naumov, who finished fourth at nationals, already had returned home. Since the crash, he has become in many ways the face of the tragedy \u2014 or at least its effect on the skating community.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve walked through a hallway and haven\u2019t given a hug since. And I feel that support and love,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s been beyond anything that I could have ever even imagined. And it helps so much to get through this day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes my heart so full.\u201d",
      "Naumov, 23, skated in a benefit in Washington earlier this month that raised more than $1.2 million for the victims\u2019 families. Speaking to reporters Sunday after performing at the world championships gala, Naumov said the time that he is on the ice gives his mind a chance to escape the tragedy.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I hit the ice, my brain just \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s focus or just calmness or stillness or what, but it feels like I tune everything out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just talking with them, and they\u2019re helping me.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hear the crowd. I don\u2019t hear the announcers, I don\u2019t hear anything. I just have this internal dialogue and I\u2019m just able to almost be calm and just be in my heart,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re always there, too. And every time I think of them, especially when I\u2019m on the ice, it really, really helps me get through.\u201d",
      "The world championships, which had previously been scheduled at the home of Boston's Celtics and Bruins, brought renewed attention to the plane crash and the century-old Skating Club of Boston that has been a home for Olympians and recreational skaters alike.",
      "There was a tribute on Wednesday, sandwiched between the day's two sessions, and frequent reminders of the tragedy.",
      "Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, who finished sixth in pairs this weekend, held up pictures of the Boston club members who died in the crash: two young skaters, their mothers and the two coaches. Reigning U.S. champion Amber Glenn wore a T-shirt honoring the memory of all the young skaters who were lost.",
      "Ilia Malinin, the \u201cQuad God\u201d who won his second straight world championship on Saturday night, finished the show on Sunday with a performance that he said was dedicated to the plane crash victims. He came to the end, red-eyed and choking back tears.",
      "Naumov\u2019s introduction on Sunday identified him as a member of the Boston club and included his three fourth-place finishes at nationals. It didn\u2019t mention the crash, but many in the crowd surely knew his connection: He received not only the polite applause that greeted most of the other skaters, but a second wave, with individuals standing to cheer him on.",
      "Wearing unadorned black pants and a sparkly black top, a gold chain flopping around his neck as he glided across the ice, Naumov gave a gala performance aimed more at emotion than proof of athletic prowess.",
      "The choice of music, Mac Miller\u2019s posthumous 2020 release \u201cThat\u2019s on Me,\u201d was intentional. Miller died of an accidental drug overdose in 2018.",
      "\u201cLately, for some reason \u2014 well, not for some reason \u2014 but lately I\u2019ve just been listening to Mac Miller\u2019s album \u2018Circles.\u2019 Like just over and over and over,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd knowing the unfortunate story about him as an artist, it\u2019s been very relatable.",
      "\u201cI relate to it, and I feel really deeply and emotionally what he\u2019s talking about in those songs. And it\u2019s also been really helpful for me to almost get my emotions out in that way personally.\u201d",
      "When his skate was over, Naumov took a deep breath, patted his heart again and waved in each direction. His bows were deep and poignant. Leaving the ice after a one-minute standing ovation, he made the sign of the cross.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotions just right now, and it\u2019s hard to even put a name to what I\u2019m feeling currently,\" he said. \"I just feel so much support, and it\u2019s very overwhelming.",

      "Much of the critical infrastructure for the project is already in place from the shuttered Homer City power plant, including transmission lines connected to the mid-Atlantic and New York power grids, substations and water access, the group said.",
      "The developers were awarded a $5 million state grant to extend a gas line to the property, which sits atop the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir.",
      "Last month, the group demolished the three cooling towers and four smokestacks still standing from the former coal plant. It shut down in 2023 after 54 years in operation.",
      "The owners, Homer City Development, blamed competition with cheaper natural gas, unseasonably warm winters that demanded less power, the rising cost of coal and increasingly expensive environmental regulations.",
      "The late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 built with help from Microsoft's data centers \u2014 ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "That has sent Big Tech companies in search of new power sources, spurred interest in a new wave of nuclear reactors, revived interest in building new gas-fired plants and stoked concerns among states and federal regulators about electricity shortages.",
      "It's also prompted utilities to delay the retirements of aging power plants and to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, including last year's announcement that the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant will reopen under a 20-year agreement to feed Microsoft's data centers.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits, but one related to TikTok barely generates a peep",
      "WASHINGTON -- After TikTok was banned in the United States earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that was passed in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court that said the ban was necessary for national security.",
      "The Republican president's executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but this one barely generated a peep. None of those suits challenges his temporary block of the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for it to be sold by ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "Few of the 431 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who voted for the law have complained.",
      "Despite a bipartisan consensus about the risk to national security posed by TikTok\u2019s ties to China, \"it\u2019s as if nothing ever happened,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "TikTok continues to function, much to the delight of its 170 million users in the U.S., and the tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle have been persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Trump declared he was suspending the law for 75 days, though no provision of the rule would appear to allow for that, to give ByteDance a fresh chance to find a U.S. buyer. The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.",
      "Trump's action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump's inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.",
      "The court's opinions dealt at length with the potential for China to harvest vast quantities of TikTok users' data that could allow it to track the locations of federal employees and contractors.",
      "\u201cThe record before us establishes that TikTok mines data both from TikTok users and about millions of others who do not consent to share their information,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a brief separate opinion. \u201cAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TikTok can access \u2018any data\u2019 stored in a consenting user\u2019s \u2018contact list\u2019 \u2014 including names, photos, and other personal information about unconsenting third parties.\u201d",
      "TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China\u2019s government has never and will not ask companies to \u201ccollect or provide data, information or intelligence\u201d held in foreign countries.",
      "The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "The president's position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.",
      "Trump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would \u201csave TikTok,\u201d then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.",
      "The law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.",
      "Trump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe law does not permit the sort of \u2018extension\u2019 that Donald Trump has announced,\" Rozenshtein said.",
      "But both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they\u2019re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,\u201d Kreps said.",
      "It also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.",
      "More importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early \"example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "While Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.",
      "Companies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok's operations since the law's effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.",
      "The companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump's order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but \u201cApple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.\"",
      "The companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.",
      "The Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.",
      "Among the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIf ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.",
      "Several potential bidders have stepped forward.",
      "Perplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Another possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, had also organized a consortium, which included the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and offered ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",

      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",

Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",

      "Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space.",
      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",

      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.",

      "Just after sunrise on Saturday, a satellite set its long-range camera on the city of Mandalay in Myanmar, not far from the epicenter of Friday\u2019s 7.7 magnitude earthquake that devastated the Southeast Asian county\u2019s second-largest city",
      "Just after sunrise on Saturday, a satellite set its long-range camera on the city of Mandalay in Myanmar, not far from the epicenter of Friday\u2019s 7.7 magnitude earthquake that devastated the Southeast Asian county's second-largest city.",
      "The mission was to capture images that, combined with artificial intelligence technology, could help relief organizations quickly assess how many buildings had collapsed or were heavily damaged and where helpers most needed to go.",
      "At first, the high-tech computer vision approach wasn\u2019t working.",
      "\u201cThe biggest challenge in this particular case was the clouds,\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres. \u201cThere's no way to see through clouds with this technology.\u201d",
      "The clouds eventually moved and it took a few more hours for another satellite from San Francisco-based Planet Labs to capture the aerial pictures and send them to Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab. By then it was already about 11 p.m. Friday at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. A group of Microsoft workers was ready and waiting for the data.",
      "The AI for Good lab has done this kind of AI-assisted damage assessment before, tracking the flooding that devastated Libya in 2023 or this year's wildfires in Los Angeles. But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "Microsoft cautioned that it \"should serve as a preliminary guide and will require on-the-ground verification for a complete understanding.\" But in the meantime, the tech company has shared the analysis with aid groups such as the Red Cross.",

      "DALLAS -- Scientists who want to learn more about a tiny flower recently discovered in West Texas are hoping it will bloom again in a couple of weeks after rain finally fell in the area.",
      "Dubbed the wooly devil, the flower with furry leaves, purplish-striped petals and pops of yellow is a new genus and species in the same family as sunflowers and daisies: Asteraceae. It was discovered last year in Big Bend National Park, known for its rugged terrain of desert, canyons and mountains, on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn with this species so they\u2019re really just getting started,\u201d said Carolyn Whiting, a Big Bend botanist.",
      "Scientists are hopeful the flowers will bloom again after rain fell on the drought-stricken park last week, giving them the opportunity to learn more including when the plants germinate, Whiting said.",
      "The flower was discovered in March 2024. Park volunteer Deb Manley and a park ranger were hiking in a remote area when they saw a patch of flowers that were smaller than a quarter and close to the ground.",
      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",
      "When Manley got back from the hike, she started researching what the flower could be. She soon found that not only was she stumped, but others were too. Her post about the flower on iNaturalist, an online platform for nature enthusiasts \u201ccaused a stir,\u201d said Isaac Lichter Marck, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.",
      "A. Michael Powell, curator and director of the herbarium at Sul Russ State University in Alpine, said when Manley contacted him about the flower, he immediately thought it was something new.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d seen before,\u201d said Powell, who has extensively studied the region.",
      "By the time a team went to collect samples of the flower a few weeks after the discovery, they had already begun to wither away.",
      "\u201cWe really got out there just in the nick of time before the specimens would have been completely dried up,\u201d Whiting said.",
      "The discovery of the flower was announced last month.",
      "Lichter Marck said they were able to extract DNA from the flower but that there's still a lot to learn. He said they don\u2019t know yet how it reproduces, or what potential uses it might have. They also need to determine if it\u2019s endangered.",
      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",
      "Kelsey Wogan, environmental lab manager at Sul Ross State University, said she\u2019s excited to see if the wooly devil can be found in other places as well and what its range is.",
      "Whiting said the park is so well-studied that finding a new species was a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s still species out there that had slipped under the radar is pretty remarkable,\u201d she said.",
      "Wogan said part of the excitement about the flower's discovery is that it shows \u201cthere\u2019s still new and undescribed things out there.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the great reminder to keep your eyes open,\" she said, \"and if you don\u2019t know what something is, it might be completely new.\u201d",

      "Huawei Technologies reported 62.6 billion yuan ($8.6 billion) in net profit last year, down from 87 billion yuan the year before. Its revenue jumped 22% to $118.2 billion, with the strongest growth in its consumer goods and automotive-related sales.",
      "The company, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, said the decline in profit was mainly due to two factors, \u201cWe continued to increase our future-oriented investment and there were no gains from the sale of businesses.\u201d",

      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",

      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",
      "If you're outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall.",
      "Depending on the location, there may be secondary hazards triggered by earthquakes, such as landslides, fires or tsunamis, he said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",

      "While Trump said the tariffs would free the U.S. from dependence on foreign goods, fears of a deepened international trade war appeared to be reflected in the stock market in the immediate aftermath.",
      "Nike and Apple's shares dropped 7%, and Amazon fell more than 5% while Nvidia saw 4.5% losses and Tesla was down 6% on Wednesday.",
      "The shares of American companies that depend largely on imported products tumbled the farthest, with Dollar Tree down 11% and Five Below seeing 15% losses.",
      "During the event at the White House on Wednesday, Trump unveiled a sweeping set of baseline tariffs on all trading partners and what he described as \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S.",
      "\"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" he said.",
      "The president announced the measures would\u00a0include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and, further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including\u00a0China, the European Union and Taiwan.",
      "Trump held up a chart with a list of nations and what the new U.S. tariffs against them will be.",

      "The 34% reciprocal rate for China is in addition to a previous 20% tariff Trump slapped on the nation -- bringing the effective tariff rate on one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners to 54% total.",
      "While the longstanding effects of Trump's newly minted tariffs stand to be seen, some experts told ABC News ahead of Wednesday that the measures could threaten economic growth and employment since duties slapped on imports risk increasing costs for businesses that rely on raw materials from abroad.",

      "A unanimous Supreme Court on Wednesday backed the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize the sale of kid-friendly flavored e-cigarettes and vapes, including the flavors \"Killer Kustard Blueberry,\" \"Rainbow Road,\" and \"Pineapple Express.\"",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, rejected the manufacturers' claims that the agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of federal law by changing the requirements for product approval in the middle of the process.",
      "\"In the end, we cannot say that the FDA improperly changed its position with respect to scientific evidence, comparative efficacy, or device type,\" Alito wrote. He returned the case to a lower court for further review.",
      "The ruling effectively holds the line on the government's decision to severely limit the number of flavored tobacco products legally available in the U.S. market out of concerns over the impact on children.",
      "Kid-friendly flavors, such as fruit, candy, mint, menthol and desserts -- which are largely not approved by the FDA and are currently sold on store shelves illegally -- have been fueling an explosion in retail sales of e-cigarettes.",
      "While vaping among youth is declining, more than 1.6 million children use the products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 90% of them consume illicit flavored brands.",
      "\"Today's ruling is a major victory for the health of America's kids and efforts to protect them from the flavored e-cigarettes that have fueled a youth nicotine addiction crisis,\" said Yolanda Richardson, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. She noted the FDA has denied over 26 million flavored e-cigarette product applications so far.",
      "\"While the FDA has authorized the sale of only 34 e-cigarette products, manufacturers continue to flood the market with thousands of illegal, unauthorized products,\" Richardson said in a statement. \"To end this crisis, the FDA must deny marketing applications for flavored e-cigarettes and step up enforcement efforts to clear the market of illegal products. Today's ruling should spur the FDA to act quickly to do so.\"",
      "An attorney for the companies -- White Lion Investments LLC, operating at Triton Distribution, and Vapetasia LLC -- said in a statement they view flavored vapes as a safe and valuable alternative for smokers trying to quit.",
      "\"We are obviously disappointed in the outcome. Triton and Vapetasia continue to believe in the great harm reduction potential of their products for cigarette smokers. We look forward to further proceedings before the Fifth Circuit on the prejudicial error issue that the Supreme Court remanded,\" said Eric Heyer, the Thompson Hine partner who argued the case.",
      "Since 2009, federal law requires sellers of new nicotine products to provide regulators with scientific evidence to show that the products would promote public health, but the statute does not spell out specifically what evidence is necessary and sufficient. The FDA's guidance on how to meet that requirement was at the center of the case.",
      "While the first Trump administration had taken a hard line against the marketing and sale sweet and candy flavored vapes, President Donald Trump said during the campaign that he wants to \"save\" flavored vapes. It's not clear how the FDA, newly under his control, may modify regulations around flavored vapes or alter the approval process.",
      "Despite their loss in the case, vape manufacturers are able to reapply for approval with the FDA in a new application and attempt to show how benefits of the product to public health would outweigh the dangers to teens.",
      "\"In light of the statutory text and the well-documented and serious risks flavored e-cigarette products pose to youth, it should have come as no surprise that applicants would need to submit rigorous scientific evidence showing that the benefits of their products would outweigh those risks,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor concluded in a short concurring opinion in the case.",

      "Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador on March 15.",
      "Despite a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official acknowledging there was an \"administrative error\" in sending a Maryland man to El Salvador -- the Trump administration is \"shockingly\" not seeking his return to the U.S., according to a new filing by the man's lawyer.",
      "Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who has a U.S. citizen wife and 5-year-old child, is currently at CECOT, the notorious prison in El Salvador despite a judge issuing an order in 2019 that barred authorities from deporting him to his home country.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney representing Abrego Garcia said in a filing on Wednesday that if the Trump administration's actions are allowed to remain without \"redress,\" then \"the orders of immigration courts are meaningless.\"",
      "\"This is an outrageous set of facts,\" said Sandoval-Moshenberg in the filing. \"If Defendants' actions in this case\u00a0are allowed to remain without redress, then the withholding of removal statute and orders of immigration courts are meaningless, because the government can deport whomever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want, and no court can do anything about it once it's done.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a lawsuit, requesting that the government of El Salvador return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after being sent there \"because of an administrative error.\"",
      "On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the administrative error and called Abrego Garcia a leader of MS-13.",
      "\"The administration maintains the position that this individual who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,\" Leavitt said.",
      "According to court records, in 2019, a confidential informant \"had advised that Abrego Garcia was an active member\" of the gang MS-13. He later filed an I-589 application for asylum and although Abrego Garcia was found removable, an immigration judge \"granted him withholding of removal to El Salvador.",
      "\"Defendants' protestation that Plaintiff is an MS-13 member, their legal argument that he is estopped for arguing otherwise, and Plaintiff's contention that the gang allegations arise from the flimsiest of unreliable anonymous informants, will be properly addressed to an immigration court,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said in Wednesday's filing.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg has said that his client \"is not a member of or has no affiliation with Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal or street gang\" and said that the U.S. government \"has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation.\"",
      "In response, the government acknowledged the error but said in a filing that because Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody, the court cannot order him to be returned to the U.S. nor can the court order El Salvador to return him.",
      "The new filing by Sandoval-Moshenberg in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction comes days before a judge is scheduled to hear arguments on the case in Maryland.",
      "\"Noncitizens -- and their U.S.-citizen spouses and children -- must know that if this nation awards them protection from persecution, it will honor that commitment even when the political winds shift,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "The attorney said that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was carried out \"by force\" and not the law.",
      "Last month, Abrego Garcia was stopped by ICE officers who \"informed him that his immigration status had changed.\"",
      "After being detained over alleged gang affiliations, he was transferred to a detention center in Texas. He was then sent to El Salvador on March 15.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Jim Banks is embracing the blowback he's gotten online.",
      "A video of Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., telling a man on Capitol Hill who identified himself as a recently fired Health and Human Services employee that he \"probably deserved it\" because \"you seem like a clown\" has gone viral.",
      "The man engaged with Banks in the video is identified as Mack Schroeder.",
      "ABC has not independently confirmed that Schroeder is a fired federal employee, but Schroeder told CNN on Wednesday he wasn't at the Capitol to \"get his job back\" but wanted to ask lawmakers what they were going to do to ensure residents were \"getting the services that they're entitled to.\"",
      "\"As we cut workers who are really ensuring that grants are going out the door to programs,\" Schroeder said on CNN. He said that he had worked on programs that support people with disabilities and older adults.",
      "\"So, I was hoping he would have, you know, some sort of plan to say, this is why we're cutting workers. This is how we're going to continue supporting residents in Indiana. But he just responded, as you saw,\" Schroeder said.",
      "Schroeder told USA Today he was among a small group of other fired federal workers protesting on Tuesday when he recorded the interaction with Banks, telling him, \"Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired illegally on February 14. There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what's happening?\"",
      "That's when Banks told Schroeder he probably deserved to be fired.",
      "Schroeder told CNN he was shocked by Banks' sharp reaction.",
      "\"First of all, I didn't ask him what is he doing to help me get reinstated in my position? I wasn't asking, 'Why did I get fired? What are you going to do to make sure me and other employees get their jobs?' I was just asking, 'What are you doing about the social services that are being cut specifically for people with disabilities?'\" Schroeder told CNN.",
      "\"He didn't even answer my question \u2026 I still have not heard a response about what the plan is, as many of these staff get cut and the programs are potentially defunded,\" he added.",
      "Shortly after Schroeder's appearance, Banks appeared on CNN and referred to Schroeder as an \"instigator\" who is \"in the hallways of the Senate office buildings every day chasing down Republicans like me and cheering for Democrats who walk through the hallways.\"",
      "\"It doesn't take a whole lot here to deduce from that he is a left-wing activist and what I have no tolerance for is anyone who believes they are entitled to a taxpayer-funded job.\"",
      "He stood by his interaction with Schroeder and said he was glad Trump was eliminating wasteful jobs in the government.",
      "\"I'm not going to shy away or back down or apologize for what I had to say [Tuesday]. This was a calculated instigator activist in the hallways of the Senate and I don't have a lot of tolerance for it.\"",
      "Asked by CNN if he had similar views about every employee who was laid off, Banks said, \"Of course not. My comments were directed at this fellow who, again, can't even explain what he does. It was a woke job that wasted taxpayer dollars and I'm thankful that President Trump eliminated that job to save tax dollars.\"",
      "Banks is fully embracing the blowback he's getting.",
      "First, he reposted the video of his exchange on X, in which he's seen calling the man a \"clown,\" adding, \"Hard truth.\"",
      "Former NFL star wide receiver Antonio Brown dubbed Banks the \"Cracker of the Day,\" and Banks replied, \"Thanks, AB. I'm honored!\"",
      "He's also changed his profile picture on X to his smiling face through the crack of the elevator door, and another video post where he declares, \"I won't apologize for speaking the truth. I 100% support President Trump and DOGE's mission to cut woke spending and government waste.\"",
      "And yet another post on X: \"I have no sympathy for left-wing activists who have been let go from overpaid positions that should never have existed. I do have sympathy for the hardworking Hoosiers whose tax dollars have been wasted on bankrolling these positions.\"",

    "summary": "A new proposal on Capitol Hill takes aim at DOGE while proposing guardrails to reassert congressional oversight authority over the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove is proposing the Defending American Diplomacy Act.",
      "As Democrats continue to express frustrations over Elon Musk's outsized role in reshaping the federal bureaucracy, a new effort on Capitol Hill takes aim at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) while proposing guardrails to reassert congressional oversight authority over the executive branch.",
      "California Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove is proposing the Defending American Diplomacy Act, which would prohibit the executive branch from reorganizing the State Department without Congressional consultation and approval.",
      "\"They are gutting foreign assistance, and I'm not going to be complicit in that,\" Kamlager-Dove, who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC News in an exclusive interview ahead of the bill's release Wednesday. \"It is unfortunate that they are crushing USAID -- What that means is American farmers are not going to have contracts that they would normally have to produce crops to sell them to other countries. By crushing foreign assistance, it also means that people in other spaces are going to get sick.\"",
      "The measure, which has more than 20 Democratic original cosponsors, requires any major reorganization of the State Department to be passed into law by an act of Congress and calls for the secretary of state to submit a detailed plan to Congress about the administration's intended reorganization and an assessment of any impacts to the U.S. diplomatic toolbox.",
      "\"We have three pillars: defense, development and diplomacy,\" Kamlager-Dove said. \"All of those things are very important when you are trying to stop us from going into war. And if we are going to get rid of those tools in our toolbox because of some dodgy thing called DOGE that is using taxpayer dollars to actually hurt taxpayers, I feel like I have a responsibility to step up and say no.\"",
      "The bill has consequences for noncompliance built into the legislative text, directing Congress to cut funding for DOGE and even prohibit travel for President Donald Trump's political appointees, including every member of his cabinet, if the administration initiates a reorganization that circumvents Congress.",
      "\"DOGE has been operating in the shadows,\" Kamlager-Dove said. \"So part of the noncompliance elements of the bill is about bringing in a little sunlight so that we have a sense about what is actually going on.\"",
      "While the administration has signaled that some eliminated jobs could be potentially absorbed by other federal agencies, the bill also prohibits that from happening without Congressional say-so.",
      "Kamlager-Dove explained that her gripe with DOGE \"is not about efficiencies.\"",
      "\"It is about unlawfully accessing our systems and our codes and stealing taxpayer dollars and doing things in the shadows,\" the representative said.",
      "\"The American people deserve to know what is happening, and if what DOGE is doing is so great, then I would think they would be more than willing to come to Congress and share with us and the American people all that they are doing,\" she added. \"But the reality is they are not willing to share that information.\"",
      "With narrow Republican majorities in both chambers and a Trump White House -- there is virtually no chance the bill becomes law in this session of Congress. But at a minimum, it gives Democrats who are powerless on the legislative front another messaging tool to campaign alongside their hopes to seize congressional majorities.",
      "Still, Kamlager-Dove argues the measure is more than a messaging bill.",
      "\"There is a lot of dysfunction with this Republican Congress right now, and the reason why we probably won't have this come up for a vote is because Republicans are too afraid of the bill. If it does come up for a vote, then they would have to put their cards on the table,\" Kamlager-Dove said. \"They would have to say, I recognize that Congress is being complicit in self-neutering itself and yielding all of its power to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Despite the long odds, Kamlager-Dove maintains optimism that her bill won't be lost among thousands of other bills as Democrats toil in the minority.",
      "\"My hope is that having this bill, having other bills like this, talking about these issues in committee, will rattle their brains and clear out the hypnotic fog that they're in,\" she said. \"If you continue to beat the drum, you do make headway, and that's what this bill is about: Beating the drum.\"",

      "\"I didn't know how long I could go. I'm so grateful I lasted for 25 hours.\"",
      "After creating history by smashing the record for the longest Senate speech in history, Sen. Cory Booker told reporters as he walked off the floor that he was achy and tired, but grateful for his time.",
      "\"I didn't know how long I could go. I'm so grateful I lasted for 25 hours,\" Booker said.",
      "Without taking a seat for the entirety of his speech, dehydration, the New Jersey senator said, had its pros and cons.",
      "Booker sidestepped a question of whether he had any sort of device or diaper on to help him with bathroom demands.",
      "However, he did say he didn't need to use the restroom for the entirety of the 25 hours because of an incredibly rigorous fasting routine.",
      "\"My strategy was to stop eating. I think I stopped eating on Friday, and then to stop drinking the night before I started on Monday. And that had its benefits and it had its really downsides,\" he said.",
      "\"The biggest thing I was fighting was that different muscles were starting to really cramp up, and every once a while, spasm or something.\"",
      "Booker's speech, which began Monday evening, continued for a total of 25 hours and 4 minutes, surpassing the previous record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes.",
      "Booker was \"very aware\" of Thurmond's record going into the speech.",
      "\"I was very aware of Strom Thurmond's record since I got to the Senate. I always felt that it was a strange shadow to hang over this institution,\" Booker told reporters.",
      "\"The mission was really to elevate voices of Americans to tell some of their really meaningful stories, very emotional stories, and to let go and let God do the rest.\"",
      "To prepare, Booker said he tried to make himself as light as possible, and took everything out of his pockets except for a notecard with a handwritten Bible verse on it: Isaiah 40:31. \"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint,\" Booker read.",
      "He relied on his faith, he said, at one point praying with Reverend Sen. Raphael Warnock ahead of the speech.",
      "For the entirety of his marathon talk-a-thon, Booker occupied the small square of space surrounding his desk.",

    "story": [
      "The justices are weighing whether Medicaid recipients can sue to access clinics.",
      "The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared sharply divided over whether individual Medicaid beneficiaries have a right to sue a state over access to Planned Parenthood after the clinics were excluded from coverage under the government's healthcare program.",
      "The case marked the first time the justices are broadly considering efforts by several conservative states to defund Planned Parenthood over its support for abortion.",
      "In 2018, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, issued executive orders disqualifying Planned Parenthood from receiving state Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion services, such as cancer screenings and contraception treatments.",
      "The group has reported drawing 34% of its overall revenue nationwide, or $699 million, from government grants, contracts and Medicaid funds.",
      "Julie Edwards, who has Type 1 diabetes and sought medical care at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, South Carolina, sued the state alleging a violation of the Medicare and Medicaid Act, which guarantees Medicaid beneficiaries a \"free choice of provider\" that is willing and qualified.",
      "\"If the individual can't sue, then this provision will be meaningless,\" Nicole Saharsky, the plaintiff's attorney, told the court during oral arguments.",
      "Each state has discretion to determine which providers are \"qualified.\" The medical qualifications of Planned Parenthood physicians were not questioned by South Carolina. Instead, the state excluded the clinics solely out of opposition to abortion.",
      "The Supreme Court's Democratic-appointed justices seemed to agree unanimously that Edwards has a right to sue under the \"free choice of provider\" provision.",
      "\"A problem that motivated Congress to pass this provision was that states were limiting the choices people had. Some states were saying only state facilities would provide the benefit. Other states were identifying a more limited subset of providers,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.",
      "\"The state has an obligation to ensure that a person ... has a right to choose their doctor,\" Justice Elena Kagan said. \"That's what this provision is. It's impossible to even say the thing without using the word 'right.'\"",
      "The state of South Carolina argued that federal law does not explicitly establish a \"right\" of individuals to sue over the availability of certain providers in Medicaid and that doing so could open the floodgates to litigation.",
      "\"Telling a state you have an obligation to provide something is not the same as telling a state an individual can sue over it,\" said John Bursch, the attorney for the state.",
      "Several of the Supreme Court's Republican-appointed members appeared inclined to side with South Carolina.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated there needs to be clear \"magic words\" in a law indicating a right to sue, suggesting the language might not be clear in this case.",
      "\"One can imagine a statute written as an individual benefit that's mandatory on the states but isn't a right-creating,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch noted.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito suggested that only the federal government could take action against a state if it were alleged to have violated the Medicare and Medicaid Act's \"free choice\" provision.",
      "\"That's the norm for spending clause legislation,\" he said, referring to the state-federal partnership in administering Medicaid.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared by their questions more circumspect about their positions on the case.",
      "The outcome of the case could have a significant impact for Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide, Planned Parenthood clinics that rely on federal funding and anti-abortion advocates hoping states will be more aggressive about ways to cut off the funds.",
      "\"Medicaid beneficiaries often face significant barriers to obtaining care, particularly in South Carolina. Twenty-five percent of state residents live in medically underserved areas,\" the Planned Parenthood plaintiffs wrote in their brief to the high court.",
      "\"[Congress] enacted the free-choice-of-provider provision to ensure that Medicaid patients, like everyone else, can choose their own doctor,\" they added. \"Congress specifically enacted this provision in response to some States' efforts to restrict Medicaid patients' choice of provider.\"",
      "While federal law already prohibits any government funding of abortions, South Carolina contends it has the right to target non-abortion funding to abortion providers.",
      "\"Because money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to abortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide more abortions,\" the state told the court.",
      "If the justices allow the suit to go forward, affirming a right to sue over the eligibility of a qualified Medicaid provider, Edwards and Planned Parenthood can continue to challenge the clinics' exclusion from the state's Medicaid program in a lower court.",
      "If the justices side with the state, they would bolster efforts to cut off Planned Parenthood from sources of government funding and effectively limit the number of providers available to Medicaid recipients.",
      "A decision in the case is expected by the end of the court's term in June.",

      "It comes amid the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle the department.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is launching a \"Save Our Schools\" campaign on Wednesday against President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon's attempt to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "\"The federal government has invested in our public schools,\" Warren said in an exclusive interview with ABC News. \"Taking that away from our kids so that a handful of billionaires can be even richer is just plain ugly, and I will fight it with everything I've got.\"",
      "Warren suggested she is working with students, teachers, parents and unions to \"sound the alarm\" nationwide.",
      "\"My starting point with this campaign is that I know the power of telling stories and the power it brings to organize people into the fight. We need numbers to win, and this is how we start,\" Warren said.",
      "In a short video obtained by ABC News that Warren is posting to her roughly 20 million social media followers Wednesday morning, Warren says she is launching an investigation into reported plans to replace Department of Education call centers with chatbots. ABC News has not independently confirmed these reports.",
      "Warren said that through a combination of federal investigations, oversight, storytelling and even lawsuits, she will work with the community, including lawmakers in Congress, to do everything she can to defend public education. Warren did not provide further details on how she plans to challenge the administration through federal oversight and lawsuits.",
      "A former special education teacher, Warren said she opposes the Trump administration's agency overhaul because she said it may result in fired teachers and increased class sizes, adding that programs for students with special needs will \"disappear.\" However, the Trump administration has vowed to keep statutory funding, such as the programs for students with special needs.",
      "Trump said those services for students with disabilities, such as those protected by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, will be rehomed in other departments, including the Department of Health and Human Services, which is undergoing massive layoffs itself.",
      "\"They think that the American people are stupid [and] will be fooled by slapping a different title on the door and that somehow our kids will get the help that they're entitled to,\" Warren told ABC News.",
      "\"No one is fooled and certainly not the kids who need that help,\" she added.",
      "The Trump administration has said it is returning education to the states in dismantling the federal department and that students will be better served by their state departments.",
      "The campaign is also personal for Warren. In the video obtained by ABC News, Warren said she has seen with her own eyes what the Department of Education does for special needs families and that she is doing everything she can to \"fight back.\"",
      "Warren said she was inspired by her second grade teacher to join the education ranks.",
      "\"Whenever someone asked about my future, I would stand a little taller and say: 'I'm going to be a teacher,'\" Warren recalled. \"It guided my entire life.\"",
      "Last month, Trump signed an executive order that aims to gut the Department of Education. It directs McMahon to close the department using all necessary steps permitted under the law. Still, eliminating the department would require an act from Congress because it was created by Congress.",
      "The campaign comes in the wake of the department cutting nearly half its workforce last month. Hundreds of employees in the Federal Student Aid Office were let go, which Warren said could have \"dire consequences\" on the tens of millions of student loan borrowers who rely on the department's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to achieve higher education. Trump has said student loans will now be handled by the Small Business Administration.",
      "\"The Department of Education (ED) appears to be abandoning the millions of parents, students, and borrowers who rely on a functioning federal student aid system to lower education costs,\" Warren and a group of Democratic senators wrote in a letter urging McMahon to reinstate the fired federal employees.",
      "The FSA's operations have already been affected, according to a source familiar. The federal student loan website was down briefly less than 24 hours after the agency cuts. Fired IT employees were called frantically to join an hourslong troubleshooting call to restore the website for millions of borrowers, according to the source.",
      "As part of Warren's campaign launch, the senator said she will also highlight the real-world impact on educators, students and families through a series of story collections. She said she is encouraging community members to share submissions on how public education has influenced their lives and what it means to them. Warren told ABC News she did a similar campaign with federal employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year.",
      "However, Warren's investigations and federal oversight could be hampered by Democrats' position in Washington.",
      "\"Democrats are in the minority in the House and the Senate, and obviously we don't have the White House, but not having as much power as we want does not mean having no power,\" Warren told ABC News. \"We've still got a lot we can do, and this combination of investigations, oversight, storytelling and lawsuits is that we can combine more power and push back hard, and it's already yielded some results.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the administration's quest to abolish the department has already triggered a legal battle by a coalition of states and education and civil rights groups, including \u200b\u200ba group of teachers unions and public school districts in Warren's home state of Massachusetts.",
      "The senator said she is hopeful every person who cares about education joins her campaign.",
      "\"We've got to fight for an America where it's not just the kids of billionaires who get a good education but it's every kid in every community who gets a great education,\" she said. \"This fight is our fight.\"",

Brittany Pettersen, who on Tuesday held her newborn son during a speech on the House floor in support of a bipartisan effort to allow proxy voting for new lawmaker parents, said the decision to bring her 9-week-old was \"difficult,\" but illustrated the need to pass the petition.",
      "\"We have the ability in 2025 to make sure that our voices and our constituents' voices are represented here, even when we have a medical reason for not being able to be here in person,\" Pettersen, holding her son Sam, said in an interview on ABC News Live on Wednesday. \"You know, this is the way things were done hundreds of years ago, I think that we can accommodate for the new workplace challenges here in Congress to make sure more women and in young families can be represented here now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers came together over proxy voting for new parents. Nine Republicans joined Democrats to tank a procedural rule that would have blocked a petition to allow new mothers and fathers to vote by proxy.",
      "With her newborn in her arms, the Colorado Democrat on Tuesday spoke in support of a resolution that would allow new parents -- both mothers and fathers -- the ability to vote by proxy up to 12 weeks after the birth of a child. In her speech -- during which Sam cooed, squealed and squeaked -- Pettersen pleaded for bipartisan cooperation on a measure that she said addressed life events such as parenthood for lawmakers.",
      "\"It was a very difficult decision to fly across the country with Sam, and it's just a decision that nobody should have to make,\" said Pettersen, who added that returning to Washington to work after her son was born prematurely put her in an \"impossible\" situation where she had to both care for a vulnerable newborn and do her job.",
      "Pettersen is only the 13th member of the House to have given birth while serving in Congress. Fellow new mom, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna -- who had a child in August 2023 -- introduced the petition.",
      "The House voted to torpedo the procedural rule that would have blocked Luna's proxy vote measure -- throwing the House into disarray and paralyzing the chamber. The vote also called into question Speaker Mike Johnson's ability to control Republicans' razor-thin majority.",
      "House Republican leaders, including Johnson, had said they would take the unprecedented step to block Luna's petition",
      "After the vote, Johnson said because it failed, \"we can't have any further action on the floor this week.\"",
      "Johnson has said proxy voting is unconstitutional and is the start of a slippery slope that could lead to more and more members voting remotely.",
      "Asked by ABC New Live Anchor Diane Macedo about her response to Johnson's argument, Pettersen said \"my message to Speaker Johnson is just let us vote.\"",
      "\"If we have narrow reasons why people can have their votes represented here if they can't be here in person, that's something that we should be able to vote on,\" she said on ABC News Live.",

Ted Cruz, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said that troubling missteps since the crash \u201cunderscore the precarious situation in the nation's airspace.\u201d Expressing frustration with the Army's refusal to turn over a memo detailing its flight rules, Cruz said during a Wednesday hearing that any deaths resulting from another collision near Reagan \u201cwill be on the Army's hands.\u201d",
      "The FAA's decision to bring in crisis counselors followed the Thursday arrest of a 39-year-old employee from Maryland on suspicion of assault and battery after the control tower fight, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority confirmed in a statement.",
      "No details were released about the altercation. The FAA said the employee was put on administrative leave while the fight is investigated.",
      "The next day, a Delta passenger jet had to take evasive action as it took off from Reagan because of the proximity of a flight of four Air Force jets involved in a flyover at Arlington National Cemetery. The incident continued a pattern of close calls that the NTSB has said went on for years around the airport as commercial flights repeatedly got dangerously close to helicopters and other aircraft.",
      "The FAA said Wednesday that it was reviewing the \u201ccurrent arrival rate of aircraft per hour, which is disproportionately concentrated within the last 30 minutes of each hour.\u201d",
      "After the crash, the arrival rate at the airport fell to 26 an hour while crews worked to recover the wreckage of the American Airlines jet and Army Black Hawk helicopter from the Potomac River. But the acting head of the FAA said at a hearing last week that arrivals are now back up to 30 an hour and could go up to 32. Now the agency is rethinking that.",
      "To help with the stress, the FAA plans regular wellness checks of its staff at Reagan as well making counselors available. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the agency took that step right after the Jan. 29 crash. The number of supervisors will increase from six to eight, and the agency will evaluate whether it has enough controllers working each shift.",
      "The union that represents air traffic controllers at Reagan and airports across the country declined to comment on the situation.",
      "During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Cruz threatened the Army with a subpoena if it did not give the committee a copy of its memo spelling out when its aircraft are allowed to fly without a key system that broadcasts their location to other aircraft turned on.",
      "The fact that system wasn\u2019t activated in the Black Hawk that collided with the passenger jet is a key concern investigators have highlighted. With the location system turned off, the tower had to rely on radar for updates on the helicopter\u2019s position that only came once every four seconds instead of every second before the crash.",
      "\u201cIt begs the question, what doesn\u2019t the Army want Congress or the American people to know about why it was flying partially blind to the other aircraft and to the air traffic controllers near DCA (Reagan airport)?,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "The Army didn\u2019t immediately respond to an inquiry Wednesday about the memo. The U.S. Army\u2019s head of aviation, Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, told the Senate Commerce Committee last week that he wasn\u2019t sure if he could provide the memo because it is part of the investigation, but the head of the NTSB assured him that would be okay.",
      "The January crash was the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.  But a series of other crashes and near misses in the months after fueled worries about air travel even though it remains safe overall.",

      "A third defendant has pleaded guilty for his role in an attempt to bribe a juror with $120,000 in exchange for acquittals in a massive COVID-related fraud case in Minnesota",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A third defendant pleaded guilty Wednesday for his role in an attempt to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash in exchange for acquittals in a massive COVID-19-related fraud case in Minnesota.",
      "Abdulkarim Shafii Farah pleaded guilty to one count of bribery of a juror. He was the third of five defendants to admit to federal charges arising from the bribery case, which broke last year during the first trial of people charged in the Feeding Our Future scandal. Two of the seven defendants in that trial were Farah's brothers.",
      "According to prosecutors, after Farah's codefendants decided to target one juror with a bribe attempt, Farah conducted surveillance of the juror and her house. He also drove a Seattle woman to the juror's house and recorded a video of her delivering the bag of cash to a relative of the juror because they didn't fully trust their accomplice. But the juror went straight to police after she got home later.",
      "Prosecutors have alleged that the defendants targeted \u201cJuror 52\u201d because she was the youngest and they believed her to be the only person of color on the panel.",
      "The Seattle woman, Ladan Mohamed Ali, pleaded guilty last September. The man who recruited her, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, pleaded guilty last July.",
      "Farah, Ali and Nur are all awaiting sentencing. Cases against the two others charged in the bribery case are pending. Although the charge against Farah carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, the prosecution and defense agreed under the plea deal that the nonbinding federal sentencing guidelines recommend 46 to 57 months in prison.",
      "Seventy people were charged and 45 have already been convicted in the larger fraud case, which centered on a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors allege the participants stole $250 million from a federal program that was meant to feed children during the pandemic. The alleged ringleader, Aimee Bock, was convicted on all counts in her trial last month. Bock's trial drew national attention partly because of an attempt to tamper with a witness that was foiled.",
      "Lisa Kirkpatrick, the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota \u2014 who has called Feeding Our Future the largest fraud scheme against COVID-19 relief programs anywhere in the country \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday that the bribe attempt was \u201ca shameful chapter in Minnesota history.\"",
      "\"I am grateful for Juror 52, who is the true hero of this story. Juror 52 \u2014 who could not be corrupted and immediately alerted law enforcement \u2014 represents the best of Minnesota,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.",

      "Beacher initially was charged in April 2024 with single counts of intentional or attempted obstruction of religious practice and making false statements to federal authorities. The charges stemmed from a break-in at the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.",
      "Prosecutors have said Beacher damaged property at the site, including several religious artifacts and numerous other items that contained holy language from the Quran, Islam\u2019s sacred scripture. Authorities said Beacher also stole a Palestinian flag and a charity box belonging to the center.",
      "Beacher is not affiliated with Rutgers, officials have said.",
      "The site was unoccupied when the break-in occurred around 2:40 a.m., prosecutors said. The overall damage was estimated at $40,000.",
      "While speaking with the FBI two days after the break-in, Beacher said he was the person seen near the center in surveillance video, but he denied breaking into the site. The incident came a few weeks after the state attorney general\u2019s office had reported a recent spike in bias incidents in New Jersey.",

      "Weather forecasters sometimes warn of storms that unleash such unusual rain they are described as 100-year or even 500-year floods.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how scientists determine how extreme a flood is and how common these extreme events are becoming.",
      "Scientists use math to help people understand how unusual a severe flood is and how to compare the intensity of one flood to another.",
      "According to the U.S. Geological Survey, one statistic scientists use is the percentage chance that a flood of a specific magnitude will happen. A 500-year flood means such an event has a 1 in 500 chance, or 0.2%, of occurring in a year.",
      "Another concept scientists use is how frequently an event of a certain intensity is expected. For example, a meteorologist can look at the average recurrence interval of an anticipated flood and see that a similar event is only expected once every 25 years.",
      "Agencies have preferred expressing the percent chance of a flood occurring rather than the recurrence interval because that statistic better represents the fact that rare floods can happen within a few years of each other. It's sort of like rolling a pair of dice and getting double six's twice in a row. It's rare, but statistically possible.",
      "Another term people hear during an impending flood is that it could be a once-in-a-generation or once-in-a-lifetime event, a casual way of saying a flood could be unlike anything many people have experienced.",
      "Researchers from the University of Chicago calculated that Houston, Texas, was struck by three 500-year flood events within 24 months from 2015 through 2017. The events included Hurricane Harvey, the heaviest recorded rainfall ever in the U.S. Homes and businesses were destroyed and cars were swept away by the floods.",
      "Although math can calculate how often to expect floods of specific magnitudes, nature has its own plans, including irregularity. Many interconnected systems in the environment, such as local weather patterns and larger events like El Nino, can contribute to the changing likelihood of floods.",
      "Since the early 1900s, precipitation events have become heavier and more frequent across most of the U.S. and flooding is becoming a bigger issue, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Gases emitted by humans, like carbon dioxide and methane, are warming the atmosphere, allowing it to hold more water vapor. For every 1 degree of Fahrenheit that the temperature warms, the atmosphere can hold nearly 4% more water, which is a 7% increase for every 1 degree Celsius, said Victor Gensini, professor of atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University. That vapor eventually falls back to the ground as rain or snow. \u201cWe\u2019ve absolutely seen a shift in the probability distribution of heavy rainfall over the last three decades,\u201d Gensini said.",
      "Other regions have experienced drought due to changing precipitation patterns. According to NASA, major droughts and periods of excessive precipitation have been occurring more frequently. Globally, the intensity of extreme wet and dry events is closely linked to global warming.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says executive orders targeting law firms are being issued in the name of national security, with the White House asserting that the firms don't deserve access to sensitive U.S. government information.",
      "But the firms fear the orders are being written so broadly as to potentially weaken national security by calling into question the status of security clearances of lawyers who, in addition to their legal practice, serve as military reservists and require their clearances to report to duty.",
      "It's an example of the sweeping and sometimes unintended consequences of White House efforts to reshape civil society, with those affected in some instances not necessarily being the ones who were top of mind when the Trump administration announced the actions in the first place. Military veterans, for instance, have not been spared from Trump's ongoing slashing of the federal government.",
      "Trump's law firm executive orders have generally targeted firms that have associations with prosecutors who previously investigated him or employ, or have employed, attorneys he perceives as political adversaries. The orders have consistently imposed the same consequences, including threatening the suspension of all active security clearances held by employees at the singled-out firms.",
      "Security clearances are issued for government workers and contractors who require access to classified national security information as part of their job. The executive branch and its agencies have wide discretion over who does and who does not obtain a clearance.",
      "It's unclear how many lawyers at the four firms still subject to executive orders \u2014 several others have averted them through settlements with the White House \u2014 hold security clearances either through their jobs or other work, or whether the Trump administration would move forward with plans to revoke the clearances of military reservists.",
      "A White House spokesman, asked for comment, pointed to the provision of the order that says the clearances are to be suspended \u201cpending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\u201d The response seemed to suggest that clearances of reservists could potentially be spared.",
      "In the meantime, though, the issue was raised during a court hearing Friday in which a lawyer representing WilmerHale, one of the targeted firms, noted that the firm has within its ranks military reservists who have security clearances. Another firm that's been subject to an executive order, Perkins Coie, also has said that it employs military reservists.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think for a minute the government lawyer is going to come up here and tell you that they actually intended to suspend the reservists\u2019 security clearances,\" Paul Clement, a prominent Washington appellate lawyer who is representing WilmerHale, told the judge. \u201cBut they\u2019re painting with such a broad brush with this thing, they aren\u2019t distinguishing sheep from goats at all.\u201d",
      "He said Friday that \u201ctwo of those lawyers have to report for their reserve duty next week. Now, I can\u2019t tell you for sure that they\u2019re going to show up and they\u2019re not going to be able to do their job because their security clearance has been suspended.\u201d",
      "Several firms, including WilmerHale and Perkins Coie, have succeeded in winning court orders temporarily blocking enforcement of certain sections of the executive orders. The security clearance provisions, though, have remained in effect, a reflection of a president's expansive powers when ordering the suspension or revocation of clearances.",
      "Dan Meyer, a lawyer who specializes in security clearances at the Tully Rinckey law firm \u2014 which is not among those targeted in the executive orders \u2014 said he assumed the number of attorneys at major law firms is small and that it was possible military reservists might be able to keep their clearances, but it could conceivably require a lengthy adjudication.",
      "\u201cIt may be that word will go quietly from the White House, \u2018Don\u2019t screw with any of these reservists at these law firms,\u2019\u201d Meyer said.",

      "\u201cThis action by ICE was troubling an extraordinarily reckless,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said. \u201cAs the judge noted, ICE's actions deprived Mr. Martell-Lebron of his right to a fair trial. It also deprived our office of our intent to hold the defendant accountable for his alleged crime.\u201d",
      "Summerville dismissed the charge against Martell-Lebron of making false statements on his driver\u2019s license application -- namely that he wasn't Martell-Lebron. After that, Summerville filed the contempt charge against Sullivan, which could lead Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden review the case to determine if any charges should be filed.",
      "\u201cIt's reprehensible,\u201d Ryan Sullivan, one of Martell-Lebron's lawyers said. \u201cLaw enforcement agents have a job to see justice is done. Prosecutors have a job to see justice is done. There is no greater injustice in my mind than the government arresting someone, without identifying themselves, and preventing them from exercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to a jury trial.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for ICE did not return a call seeking comment.",
      "Immigration officers were a growing presence at courthouses during Trump\u2019s first term, prompting pushback from judges and other local officials. Trump has gone further in his second term by repealing a policy in place since 2011 to generally avoid schools, places of worship and hospitals.",
      "Under current policy, immigration officials can make arrests \u201cin or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present\u201d and as long as they are not prohibited by state or local law.",
      "During the two-day hearing, Sullivan said that the lead prosecution witnessed confirmed that both the Massachusetts State police and prosecutors were aware of ICE plans to arrest Martell-Lebron.",
      "Hayden said could not recall a case where ICE had detained a defendant during a trial.",
      "\u201cIt should not have happened, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Sullivan described a tense scene, in which ICE agents pounced on Martell-Lebron without identifying themselves, put him into a pickup truck and sped away. The trial Thursday had just begun with opening statements and the first witnesses.",
      "Sullivan said Martell-Lebron, who is from the Dominican Republic and living with family in Massachusetts, is now at the Plymouth detention facility for allegedly being an undocumented immigrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we were challenging is that they arrested him in the middle of his trial and did not return him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he had been brought to court on Friday morning by ICE, we would not have moved to dismiss. We would not be asking for sanctions. We would have just finished the trial.\"",

      "ICE had argued against his release at a court hearing following the arrest because local police in Maryland had \u201cverified\u201d his gang membership, his lawyers' complaint said.

      "\u201cOnly states have sued here, and only to vindicate their interests as states,\" Bredar wrote. \u201cThey are not proxies for the workers.\u201d",
      "The order requires the 18 agencies originally named in the lawsuit to follow the law in conducting any future reductions in force. Bredar has now added the Defense Department and the Office of Personnel Management to that number.",
      "Bredar previously found that the firings amount to a large-scale reduction subject to specific rules, including giving advance notice to states affected by the layoffs.",

      "Senate Republicans are facing pressure from President Donald Trump to resist voting for a Democratic resolution to nullify the presidential emergency on fentanyl he is using to implement tariffs on Canada",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are facing pressure Wednesday from President Donald Trump to oppose a Democratic resolution that would nullify the presidential emergency on fentanyl he is using to implement tariffs on Canada.",
      "Just hours after Trump is set to announce his plan for \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on China, Mexico and Canada \u2014 his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 the Senate was expected to vote on a resolution that offers Republicans an off-ramp to the import taxes on Canada. It is a significant test for Republican loyalty to Trump's vision of remaking the U.S. economy by clamping down on free trade. Many economists are warning that the plan could cause an economic contraction, and GOP senators are already watching with unease as Trump upends U.S. standing with the rest of the world.",
      "The votes of at least four Republicans \u2014 Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 were thought to be lining up in favor of the resolution. If all Democrats plus the four Republicans vote in favor, it would boost it to the simple majority needed to pass the Senate. The legislation would still need to be brought up and passed in the Republican-controlled House.",
      "In a social media post just before 1 a.m. Wednesday, Trump singled out the four senators, saying they \u201cwill hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl.\u201d",
      "To justify the tariffs, Trump has argued that Canada is not doing enough to stop illegal drugs from entering the northern border. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl in its northern border sector during the 2024 fiscal year, and since January, authorities have seized less than 1.5 pounds, according to federal data. Meanwhile, at the southern border, authorities seized over 21,000 pounds last year.",
      "\u201cThis is not about fentanyl. It\u2019s about tariffs. It\u2019s about a national sales tax on American families,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who initiated the resolution, said at at news conference Wednesday.",
      "Democrat are arguing that Trump is using the tariffs to pay for tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, but will make it more expensive to build homes, disrupt industries and raise prices on imported grocery products. Kaine pointed to aluminum imported from Canada that would hurt businesses ranging from pie makers to shipbuilders.",
      "\u201cToday, Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to the American economy and even to the American dream,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech.",
      "He added, \u201cThe Senate has a chance to slow this trade war down today if Republicans join us.\u201d",
      "On the heels of election results in Wisconsin and Florida that delivered early warning signs to Republicans about the popularity of Trump's agenda, Schumer said that Trump is particularly vulnerable when it comes to the economy.",
      "\u201cOnce the American people say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to embrace somebody, I don\u2019t want to vote for somebody, I don\u2019t want to support somebody who embraces Trump\u2019s policies,\u2019 things are going to change,\" he told reporters. \u201cPublic sentiment is everything.\"",
      "For their part, Republican leaders were trying to hold their members in line against the tariff resolution by emphasizing that Trump was acting to address fentanyl trafficking and border security.",
      "Majority Whip Sen. John Barrasso argued in a floor speech that former President Joe Biden had \u201calso thrown open the northern border. The criminal cartels noticed and they took advantage.\u201d",
      "\"There are unique threats to the United States at our northern border,\" the Wyoming senator said. \u201cPresident Trump is taking the bold, decisive, swift action that is necessary to secure that border as well.\u201d",
      "Republicans lined up on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon to underscore the need to act to halt fentanyl trafficking, including at the northern border. However, a key group of Senate Republicans were also indicating their opposition to tariffs on Canada.",
      "In a floor speech Wednesday, Collins said she would support the resolution and noted, \u201cThe fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border.\u201d",
      "Collins noted that Canada is already beefing up border security to address drug trafficking and said she was concerned what tariffs would do to businesses and households in Maine. She pointed to a paper mill in her home state that pumps paper pulp from Canada.",
      "\u201cA tariff placed on this pulp would jeopardize the financial wellbeing of this vital paper mill, which employs more than 500 people in rural, northern Maine. There is not another big employer in that area that can possibly compensate for the loss of those 510 direct jobs,\u201d Collins said.",
      "While a younger group of Republicans closely aligned with Trump have spoken out in favor of the president's plans to aggressively reshape the economy, a sizeable portion of the Republican Conference noted concerns about the tariff impacts on farmers and other industries. Still, most wanted to give Trump room to negotiate better trade deals.",
      "North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said that he has been in constant talks with both Canadian officials and businesses in his state like Bobcat, which does a significant amount of its sales in Canada. But he didn't plan on supporting the resolution. Instead, he hoped that Trump's Wednesday announcement would just be a starting point for negotiations for the reciprocal dropping of tariffs.",
      "The Republican added: \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned about it, but obviously it occupies a lot of attention and time and a lot of political anxiety.\"",
      "But Democrats had found a way to press into that anxiety and test their GOP colleagues' support for Trump's vision for vast changes in how the U.S. interacts with longtime allies.",
      "\u201cLike President Trump, I think it\u2019s right to say, \u2018America first.\u2019 But I don\u2019t want America alone,\u201d said Kaine. \u201cI don\u2019t want an America pushing aside its long standing allies who have stood with us.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday laid off scores of Health and Human Services employees, including many who ran the Head Start early education program",
      "WASHINGTON -- The problems for Head Start began days after President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Trump's administration announced it would freeze federal grants \u2014 the primary funding for the early education program that serves more than half a million low-income children. Then came glitches with the funding website that forced nearly two dozen Head Start centers to close temporarily.",
      "Even after the funding freeze was aborted \u2014 and the website was restored \u2014 those who run the programs remained on edge. On Tuesday, the administration gave them another reason to worry: mass layoffs.",
      "Scores of government employees who help administer Head Start, which is federally funded but run by schools and nonprofits, have been put on leave. Preschool operators say they have received no communication from the Office of Head Start and don't know who to turn to if they have questions about grants or need the office to sign off on equipment expenditures.",
      "They fear the program, which serves some of the nation's neediest kids and families, could fall victim to the Trump administration's sweeping cuts.",
      "Head Start was started six decades ago as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty. While the early childhood program has enjoyed bipartisan support since then, some Republicans have emphasized its shortcomings and criticized efforts to increase funding. And Project 2025, the policy blueprint created by the conservative Heritage Foundation, called for eliminating Head Start altogether.",
      "Joel Ryan, head of the Washington State Association of Head Start, said he is worried the administration is slowly dismantling the program without outright eliminating it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be from an act of Congress,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou can kneecap programs simply by cutting significant numbers of their workforce.\u201d",
      "Head Start operates in all 50 states, helping families who are homeless or are in poverty. Parents who otherwise would not be able to afford child care rely on it when they work or go to school. Supporters say that underscores the importance of Head Start to the economy and at-risk children alike.",
      "At least five of the 12 regional offices for Head Start were closed Tuesday as part of layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to the National Head Start Association. While individual preschools' funding remains unchanged, the association\u2019s statement said the cuts happened without a \u201cclear plan for how the administration intends on supporting Head Start.\u201d",
      "Some worry Head Start will become partisan.",
      "\u201cWhat I don't want Head Start to be is a political football,\u201d said Rhett Cecil, executive director of the Indiana Head Start Association. \u201cBecause a Republican household, a Democratic household, a libertarian household could be a Head Start household.\u201d",
      "In mid-March, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose department oversees Head Start, visited a Head Start in Alexandria, Virginia, praising the program and its staff.",
      "\u201cI had a very inspiring tour,\u201d Kennedy said in a video on his department's Instagram account. \u201cThey\u2019re getting the kind of education socialization and education that they need.\"",
      "Still, advocates worry the GOP's efforts to slash the federal budget will ensnare programs like Head Start.",
      "Already, the staff layoffs have caused concerns. Head Start preschools in Washington state had been awaiting approval to replace downed fencing around a playground and to purchase a refrigerator for a center. Ryan said he fears some operators will lose funding because grant applications won't get processed.",
      "The preschools are deeply reliant on federal money. During the brief hold on federal grants, no program was impacted more immediately. Unable to make payroll the day of the freeze, several Head Start centers temporarily closed \u2014 cutting off child care for low-income families, for whom a day without work is often a day without pay.",
      "The news about the funding freeze emerged in January as Head Start leaders from across the country were together at the Capital Hilton, a few blocks away from the White House, preparing to meet with Congress members. Gathered in a conference room, many leaders simultaneously realized they were locked out of their funds.",
      "\u201cYou could almost feel ... the wave of panic all over the room when I think we all realized at the same time that everyone was locked out of that payment management system,\u201d said Chanda Hillman, executive director of Early Flowers Learning. The group operates 17 Head Start campuses in rural parts of southwestern Michigan.",
      "A few hours later, Hillman had to make the call: She would shut down the Early Flowers Learning campuses.",
      "Kahli Lorenz, whose daughter attends Early Flowers, had traveled with Hillman to D.C. as part of a parent advisory council. She had been reeling at the possibility her daughter would have no place to go the following day \u2014 or that her beloved preschool would close. So when Lorenz heard Hillman make the announcement, she fell apart.",
      "Both she and her husband work \u2014 and she was out of town. Without Head Start the next day, he would miss half of his shift \u2014 and half of his pay \u2014 at the factory where he works. But she thought of all of her daughter's classmates, and all the parents like her who might not be able to work without Head Start.",
      "\u201cThat meant all of the families were not going to have anywhere to have their kids,\u201d she said.",
      "Halfway across the country, Cecil of the Indiana Head Start Association learned about the reported freeze from a Head Start director, and immediately began to fret. The closure of Head Start centers across the state would leave families in a pinch. But he also worried about those who would be furloughed \u2014 Head Start is Indiana's 78th largest employer with nearly 4,000 staff.",
      "Not long after came another confusing piece of news: Head Start was never supposed to be a part of the funding freeze. So why, Head Start directors wondered, had they been shut out of the funding portal? Asked about the pause, the Department of Health and Human Services responded with an automatic message that said it was freezing all communication.",
      "Even after the freeze was aborted and the Head Start portal was supposed to be fixed, many centers discovered they still could not access their funds. A week later, at least 45 grant recipients across the country were still locked out, and many were on the verge of closure. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, Head Start programs shut their doors and furloughed most of their staff. The programs would not reopen until the following week when their leaders could access the funds.",
      "Unable to make payroll, two Head Start centers that served rural communities in western New York shut their doors, laying off 84 employees and leaving the families of more than 200 children without care. They would not reopen until Feb. 10, when they were finally able to draw down funds.",
      "Head Start leaders said members of Congress from both parties were in touch during the crisis, working to get them answers.",
      "For Hillman, it raised hope that Head Start will continue to enjoy bipartisan support \u2014 even if some conservatives oppose it.",

      "A high-stakes race to decide who will get to build a casino in New York City might end up with one famous former resident hitting a $115 million jackpot: President Donald Trump",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A high-stakes contest to decide who gets to build a casino in New York City could potentially result in a $115 million jackpot for President Donald Trump.",
      "The Republican stands to win big if state officials award one of three available gaming licenses to Bally\u2019s Corp., which wants to open a casino at a city-owned golf course that used to be run by Trump's company.",
      "In 2023, Bally's paid Trump $60 million for the rights to operate the public 18-hole course on the Bronx shoreline, near where the East River meets the Long Island Sound.",
      "The gaming company promptly took down the massive \u201cTrump Links\u201d sign that was, at one time, all but impossible to miss for drivers going the Whitestone Bridge, and renamed the course Bally's Golf Links at Ferry Point.",
      "But under a little-noticed side deal, Bally\u2019s promised to pay Trump another $115 million if Bally\u2019s were to get a license to open a casino on site.",
      "The letter disclosing that deal was included as an evidence exhibit in a trial over New York state's allegation that Trump habitually lied about the worth of his assets in financial statements given to banks. The letter says the $115 million payment would be nonrefundable and describes it as a \u201cgaming event fee.\u201d",
      "Bally's did not return requests for comment.",
      "Trump's interest in Bally's project could be a wildcard in New York's casino sweepstakes.",
      "At least 11 bidders have said they are competing for the right to build what would be the first, full-service casino in the city and its nearest suburbs.",
      "The race has drawn in big players: Caesars Palace has a plan to build a casino in Times Square; the company that owns Saks Fifth Avenue wants to put a casino atop their luxury department store in Manhattan; and Steve Cohen, the owner of the New York Mets, is proposing a casino right outside the baseball team's home stadium in Queens.",
      "Another two bidders are hoping to expand on existing operations. MGM Resorts wants to do a major upgrade of its existing Empire City \u201cracino,\u201d located at a horse track in the suburb of Yonkers. The gaming company Genting wants to do a multibillion expansion of its Resorts World racino adjacent to the Aqueduct horse track in Queens. Those two gambling venues are now limited by law to slot machines and certain other machine-run games.",
      "It is unclear how Trump's link to one of the bidders might affect the selection process.",
      "Applications are supposed to be submitted to a state board by late June. First, they will be considered by community advisory committees made up of appointees of the governor, mayor and state and local officials. Their job will be to weigh any local support or opposition. The proposals then go back to the state's gaming board, which expects to award the licenses by the end of the year.",
      "Applicants also have to get various zoning or land-use approvals depending on the location and scope of their projects. Bally\u2019s project is also expected to require the state Legislature to pass a bill allowing the company to build their casino on public parkland.",
      "The federal government does not play any role in the state's casino license selection process. The Trump Organization did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.",
      "Trump remains highly unpopular among many public officials in New York who will be in a position to influence the process, and it is possible that antipathy could wind up being a handicap for Bally's bid.",
      "There's also a chance someone might try to use Trump's financial interest as a bargaining chip.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has clashed with the Trump administration over immigration policy, federal funding for the city\u2019s subway system and a tolling program in Manhattan. The Trump administration is also trying to revive a plan to build a natural gas pipeline through New York that was halted in 2017 by state environmental regulators.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams, meanwhile, has been under intense pressure to prove his political independence after the Justice Department moved to drop his corruption case so he could assist with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda.",
      "Trump, whose Trump Organization runs more than a dozen golf courses around the world, first acquired the rights to manage Ferry Point in 2012.",
      "The city spent more than $120 million to build the Jack Nicklaus-designed course on an old landfill, envisioning an East Coast version of the famed Pebble Beach links in California and major championships that never materialized.",

      "U.S. Justice Department lawyers say a Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey who was detained by immigration authorities had been moved to Vermont by the time a federal judge ordered that she be kept in Massachusetts",
      "BOSTON -- A Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey who was detained by immigration authorities had been moved to Vermont by the time a federal judge ordered authorities to keep her in Massachusetts, lawyers for the U.S. government said.",
      "Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was taken by immigration officials as she walked along a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville on March 25. She was put on a plane the next day and moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in remote Basile, Louisiana.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge in Boston, responding to a petition filed by Ozturk's lawyers, said Ozturk can't be removed from the United States \u201cuntil further order of this court.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, lawyers for the Justice Department argued that the judge lacks jurisdiction to decide Ozturk's case. They said Ozturk's lawyers had to file her petition in the jurisdiction where she was confined, The Boston Globe reported. They said the case should be dismissed or transferred to Louisiana, and that any challenge belonged in immigration court.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers have said that her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process. It asked the judge to order that she be immediately returned to Massachusetts and released from custody.",
      "Rallies in support of Ozturk were held in Boston and at Tufts University on Tuesday.",
      "Ozturk is among several people with ties to American universities who attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians during the war in Gaza and who have recently had visas revoked or been stopped from entering the U.S.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed the termination of Ozturk's visa last week, saying investigations found Oztruk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. The department did not provide evidence of that support.",
      "\u201cWe gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist, to tear up our university campuses,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week when asked about Ozturk. during a stop in Guyana.",

      "A German shepherd-husky dog has evaded capture for nearly two months after being rescued from a California shelter and running away from her adoptive home in Alaska",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- In the days after wildfires devastated the Los Angeles area, a formerly stray dog named Jackie lucked into a new life. She was rescued from an overburdened shelter in Los Angeles County, where she faced possible euthanasia, and given a home far away in Juneau, Alaska.",
      "But Jackie didn\u2019t stay long.",
      "The German shepherd-husky mix slipped her collar on the first day with her new family in mid-February and absconded to a pocket of forest. Since then, she has been living by her wits \u2014 eluding a trap that was set with food such as cheeseburgers or chicken by animal control workers and volunteers worried about her.",
      "The forested area Jackie frequents is near a busy road. Further, black bears are starting to reemerge from hibernation, raising the potential the dog could have an unfortunate run-in. Volunteers have stopped putting out food and cat kibble to avoid attracting bears.",
      "\u201cMaybe this is what she wants, is to be free and feral like this,\u201d said Thom Young-Bayer, a Juneau animal control officer. \"It's not a safe way for her to live here.\u201d",
      "Young-Bayer and his wife, Skylar, have been searching in their free time, often at night, for the skittish canine, painstakingly trying to build trust with her. Jackie has been known to burrow into the soft moss on the forest floor for cover and to avoid looking directly into the Young-Bayers\u2019 headlamps, making it hard to detect her eyes in the dark.",
      "On videos Thom Young-Bayer has taken with his infrared camera, Jackie\u2019s red heat signature resembles something out of the movie \u201cPredator.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Young-Bayer caught a fleeting glimpse of Jackie in the lush forest, her dark coat helping camouflage her movements among the stumps and roots. He surveyed the undergrowth and surroundings but came up empty \u2014 as did a nearby trap he had been monitoring for weeks.",
      "When Young-Bayer returned to a trail where a fellow animal control officer had been waiting, he learned Jackie had trotted past on a frozen pond.",
      "Lately Young-Bayer been encountering Jackie on every visit. Young-Bayer says that's progress. Weeks ago, if Jackie saw someone, she would flee. He and his wife aren't trying to sneak up on the dog and want to help her feel safe, he said.",
      "Juneau Animal Rescue, a local pet adoption agency that also handles animal control and protective services, has asked that people who see Jackie report their sightings. Given the dog's skittishness, officials want to limit those searching for her.",
      "Little is known about Jackie's history. She was brought into a California shelter as a stray in early January, days before deadly wildfires swept through the Los Angeles area. She is believed to be 2 to 3 years old. Her intake forms listed her as quiet with a moderate anxiety and stress level.",
      "Skylar Young-Bayer, who has volunteered with rescue groups in that region, helped arrange for Jackie and two other dogs at risk of being euthanized to be transferred to Juneau for adoption. Jackie was with a foster home before her adoption placing.",
      "Other dogs have gained fame as fugitives, including Scrim, a 17-pound, mostly terrier mutt who was recaptured in New Orleans in February \u2014 in a cat trap \u2014 after months on the lam.",
      "Mike Mazouch, animal control and protection director for Juneau Animal Rescue, noted Jackie didn't have much time to bond with her new family before bolting. Officers deemed trying to tranquilize her as too risky because they didn't know if they would be able to find her once she was sedated.",
      "Mazouch accompanied Thom Young-Bayer to the forest last week to disassemble the trap when Jackie came within 50 feet (15 meters) of Mazouch on the frozen pond. Mazouch snapped a photo of her as she appeared between the skinny, tall trees. He called efforts to capture her a \u201cbattle of wills.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is not willing to give up, and we're not willing to give up, either,\u201d Mazouch said.",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is traveling this week to a gathering of top diplomats from NATO countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio travels this week to a gathering of top diplomats from NATO countries and is sure to find allies that are alarmed, angered and confused by the Trump administration\u2019s desire to reestablish ties with Russia and its escalating rhetorical attacks on longtime transatlantic partners.",
      "Allies are deeply concerned by President Donald Trump\u2019s readiness to draw closer to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who sees NATO as a threat, amid a U.S. effort to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine. Recent White House comments and insults directed at NATO allies Canada and Denmark \u2014 as well as the military alliance itself \u2014 have only increased the angst, especially as new U.S. tariffs are taking effect against friends and foes alike.",
      "Rubio arrives in Brussels on Thursday for two days of meetings with his NATO counterparts and European officials, and he can expect to be confronted with questions about the future U.S. role in the alliance.",
      "For 75 years, NATO has been anchored on American leadership, and based on what they have seen and heard since Trump took office in January, European officials have expressed deep concerns that Trump may upend all of that when he and other NATO leaders meet for a June summit in the Netherlands.",
      "As Rubio did last month at a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies, America's top diplomat, who is regarded by many overseas as a more pragmatic and less dogmatic member of Trump's administration, may be able to salvage a watered-down group consensus on the war in Ukraine.",
      "That's even as Trump said this week that Ukraine \u201cwas never going to be a member of NATO\u201d despite leaders declaring at last year's summit that the country was on an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to join.",
      "But Rubio will be hard-pressed to explain Washington\u2019s unprovoked verbal attacks on NATO allies Canada, which Trump says he wants to claim as a 51st state, and Denmark, whose territory of Greenland he says the U.S. should annex. Both have been accused of being \u201cbad allies\u201d by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear neither territory has any interest in joining a Trumpian America,\u201d said Ian Kelly, U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administration and now an international studies professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of very anxious Euros about what Trump is going to call for and what announcements he\u2019s going to make,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he isn't already, Rubio is going to be in a mode of trying to reassure European allies that we are not, in fact, not dependable.\u201d",
      "Yet, in just under two months, NATO has been shaken to its core, challenged increasingly by Russia and the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 from the outside, and by the Trump administration from within, breaking with decades of relatively predictable U.S. leadership.",
      "Trump has consistently complained about NATO members' defense spending and even raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to mutual defense in the alliance's founding treaty, which says an attack on one NATO member is considered an attack on all.",
      "Since Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned last month that U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere \u2014 in Asia and on its own borders \u2014 the Europeans have waited to learn how big a military drawdown in Europe could be and how fast it may happen.",
      "In Europe and Canada, governments are working on \u201cburden shifting\u201d plans to take over more of the load, while trying to ensure that no security vacuum is created if U.S. troops and equipment are withdrawn from the continent.",
      "These allies are keen to hear from Rubio what the Trump administration\u2019s intentions are and hope to secure some kind of roadmap that lays out what will happen next and when, so they can synchronize planning and use European forces to plug any gaps.",
      "At the same time, NATO\u2019s deterrent effect against an adversary like Russia is only credible when backed by U.S. firepower. For the Europeans and Canada, this means that U.S. nuclear weapons and the 6th Fleet must remain stationed in Europe.",
      "\u201cAmerica is indispensable for credible deterrence,\" a senior NATO diplomat told reporters on condition of anonymity to speak ahead of the meeting.",
      "Around 100,000 U.S. troops are deployed across the continent. European allies believe at least 20,000 personnel sent by the Biden administration after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago could be withdrawn.",
      "Another priority for U.S. allies is to understand whether Trump believes that Russia still poses the greatest security threat. In their summit statement last year, NATO leaders insisted that \u201cRussia remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies\u2019 security.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s receptiveness to Putin and recent favorable remarks by some U.S. officials have raised doubts. The question, diplomats say, is why allies should spend 5% of their gross domestic product on their defense budgets if Russia is no longer a threat.",
      "At the same time, the Europeans and Canada know they must spend more \u2014 not least to protect themselves and keep arming Ukraine. At their next summit in June, NATO leaders are expected to raise the alliance\u2019s military budget goal from at least 2% to more than 3%.",
      "Rubio \u201cis in a very difficult position,\u201d said Jeff Rathke, president of the American-German Institute at Johns Hopkins University. Trump \u201chas tried to convince allies that a U.S. realignment with Russia is in the best interests of the U.S. and presumably Europe, and at the same time tell them that they need to double their defense spending to deal with threats posed by Russia,\" he said. \"The logical question they will ask is \u2018why?'\u201d",

      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",

      "Here's how you and your money could be affected.",
      "1. Prices could go up, but could also go down",
      "The tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.",
      "Clarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.",
      "However, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.",
      "One way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Following Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.",
      "Higher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",
      "Ms Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.",
      "\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "2. It could affect your job",
      "British companies which export goods to the US are set be the hardest hit from the latest measures.",
      "The UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.",
      "If US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.",
      "According to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.",
      "It says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.",

      "The US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US.

      "However, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\".",
      "If prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.",
      "Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs."

      "Tesla shares tumbled in early trading on Wednesday after the release of the low sales numbers.",

      "\"These numbers suck,\" early Tesla investor Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management wrote on X.",
      "\"The brand is broken and may not be fixable\", added Mr Gerber, who was once a Musk supporter but has recently called for the board to remove the billionaire as CEO.",
      "'Tesla takedown'",

      "He has been heading up President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative to cut federal spending and slash the government workforce.",
      "On Wednesday, Politico reported that Trump had told his inner circle Musk would be stepping back from the administration in the coming weeks.",
      "Shortly after the report was published, Tesla's share price turned positive.",
      "The White House shot down the report as \"garbage\". Because he is considered a special government employee, Musk by law can only serve 130 days in the administration this year, which would put his departure closer to June.",
      "The Tesla boss is the world's richest man and contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump get elected in November.",
      "In recent weeks, he poured millions into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race, supporting former Republican attorney general Brad Schimel who was soundly defeated on Tuesday.",
      "The backlash against Mr Musk has included \"Tesla Takedown\" protests at Tesla dealerships across the US and in Europe.",
      "Tesla vehicles have also been vandalised, and Trump has said his administration would charge people who deface Teslas with \"domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Musk's stewardship of his businesses, including Tesla, has been called into question.",
      "In an recent interview, he admitted he was running his enterprises \"with great difficulty,\" adding: \"Frankly, I can't believe I'm here doing this.\"",
      "Tesla shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since the beginning of this year, as of 13:51 EDT (18:51 BST) on Wednesday.",
      "\"We are not going to look at these numbers with rose colored glasses... they were a disaster on every metric,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note on Wednesday.",
      "\"The more political [Musk] gets with DOGE the more the brand suffers, there is no debate.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that the numbers released on Wednesday \"represent only two measures\" of the company's performance and \"should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results.\"",
      "Those results will be made public on April 22 in a full earnings report for the quarter. They will  \"depend on a variety of factors, including average selling price, cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and others\", Tesla said.",
      "It also noted that it had temporarily suspended production of its Model Y sport utility vehicles in January.",
      "Following the release of Wednesday's report, Randi Weingarten, president of American Federation of Teachers, one of the most powerful labour unions in the US, wrote to dozens of public pension funds about the state of Tesla, saying  the company's latest sales numbers were \"shaping up to be abysmal\".",
      "She urged them to take close looks at their Tesla holdings and at what their money managers are doing to \"safeguard retirement assets\".",
      "\"These declines seem in part to be driven by Musk spending his time pursuing political activities, some of which appear to be in conflict with Tesla's brand and business interests, rather than managing Tesla,\" Weingarten wrote.",

      "Donald Trump says tariffs are coming. That message from the US president has been consistent.",
      "But what tariffs and when? Import taxes have come so thick and fast since he took office that it can be hard to keep track.",
      "Trump has already raised duties on Chinese imports, as well as steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Higher levies on cars are due to go into effect this week.",
      "We're now waiting for Trump to unveil the details of his plan for a wider set of tariffs, which his team has spent the last few weeks developing.",

      "Live updates as Trump plans to announce sweeping tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Live updates as Trump plans to announce sweeping tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "How big are the tariffs?",
      "The White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.",
      "Once in office, he introduced the idea of \"reciprocal\" tariffs, suggesting the rates could vary country by country.",
      "\"Very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them,\" he said in February, shortly before he ordered officials to develop such a plan.",
      "The White House almost immediately complicated the picture, noting that their recommendations would reflect not just tariffs but also other policies they believe are unfair to US businesses, like Value Added Tax (VAT).",
      "It has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump.",
      "Officials in Europe, for example, are preparing for a double-digit tariff on their exports. Trump earlier this year said he planned to hit goods from the bloc with a 25% import tax.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The Trump administration has not confirmed which countries will be hit, although it has trailed Wednesday's announcement as a sweeping one.",
      "On Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to \"all countries\", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign.",
      "It dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal.",
      "But it is still unclear to what extent the tariffs will be universally applied or more targeted.",
      "Last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said efforts were focused on the \"Dirty 15\" - the 15% of countries that account for the bulk of trade with the US and impose tariffs or other rules that put US firms at a disadvantage.",
      "The Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was  \"particularly interested\".",
      "They were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and Vietnam.",
      "Trump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU.",
      "\"Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,\" he declared last week.",
      "What impact will the tariffs have?",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports. So the big question is, who will pay?",
      "Technically, there is a simple answer: the US firms bringing in the goods are the companies that will face the bill, especially if the White House starts levying the tariffs \"immediately\", as spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested on Tuesday.",
      "But the larger the tariffs are, the more firms will be looking for ways to offset those costs, either by changing suppliers, pushing business partners to share the burden - or by raising prices for Americans.",
      "Many firms have said they are already preparing for that step. But it is a risky game because if companies raise prices too much, buyers will simply stay away.",
      "The dynamics have raised the risks of an economic recession both in the US - and far outside its borders, where many firms rely on US sales.",
      "Trump says companies looking to avoid tariffs can simply do their business in the US, but that's not an immediate, or easy fix, given the high costs of hiring and setting up factories.",
      "Introduce currency swings and retaliation by other countries into the mix, and the repercussions of Trump's bid to reset global trade balances are likely to prove hard to predict long after Wednesday's announcement."

    "summary": "MPs hear the airport was warned about power supply resilience days before the disruptive closure.",
    "story": [
      "Heathrow Airport was warned about the \"resilience\" of its power supply in the days before a fire which shut down the airport for more than a day last month.",
      "Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators' Committee, a group representing airlines, told MPs on Wednesday that he spoke to Heathrow twice in the week before the closure on 21 March.",
      "He questioned why the airport was closed as long as it was and why it was not more prepared considering its importance.",
      "However, Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye called the fire an \"unlikely event\" and defended the length of the closure, saying he had to make \"very serious safety decisions\".",
      "Mr Woldbye apologised to the more than 300,000 passengers whose journeys were disrupted.",
      "He offered his \"deepest regrets\" adding that the \"situation was unprecedented\". The airport was shutdown after a fire at an electrical substation.",
      "The chaos at Heathrow has raised concerns about the reliability of the major transport hub - and brought into question the UK's energy resilience more broadly.",
      "Power concerns",
      "Speaking to MPs on the transport committee, Mr Wicking said he raised cases of \"theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply\" which he said temporarily took out runway lights, which are critical to passenger safety.",
      "\"I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.\"",
      "He said he had spoken to the Team Heathrow director on 15 March about his concerns - six days before the fire - and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on 19 March - two days before the fire.",
      "Mr Woldbye said the airport had to rely on contracts it has with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for making the network resilient, and to improve that \"comes at a very high cost\", which would raise costs for airlines, and passengers.",
      "However, Mr Wicking said Heathrow is \"already the most expensive airport in the world\".",
      "\"From an airline perspective, we expect resilience, we expect there to be the capability there and the understanding of when a power supply or an asset is not available, what will you do next, and how quickly will you bring it back?\"",
      "On the day of the shutdown, airlines had to divert 120 aircraft, which is \"not a light decision to be made in any context\", Mr Wicking added.",
      "As a consequence, when Mr Wicking joined a call with NATs, the national air traffic service, at 05:30, \"they'd run out of space within the UK for aircraft to divert\".",
      "\"Aircraft were then going to Europe, and then some were even halfway across Europe and going back to base in India,\" he said. \"So, quite a level of disruption for those passengers, let alone all of the cancellations\".",
      "There were 1,300 cancelled flights, he said.",
      "The airport reopened on the Saturday following the fire.",
      "When asked why it had not reopened sooner, Mr Woldbye said that could have meant passengers got hurt.",
      "He said: \"If we had got this wrong, we might be sitting here today having a very different discussion about why people got injured, and I think it would have been a much more serious discussion.",
      "\"So there is a margin within which our people have to take very serious safety decisions, and that is what they are trained for, that is what they do, and that requires that every single system is up and running, tested and safe.\"",
      "However, Mr Wicking said Terminal 5 could have reopened sooner.",
      "He said: \"In terms of T5, my understanding both from British Airways but also on the day, was that pretty much everything was fine to operate by mid-morning, by 10 o'clock.\"",
      "'Losing power'",
      "After the substation fire began on the Thursday night, Mr Woldbye said Heathrow realised \"during the early hours\" of Friday 21 March that \"we were losing power to the airport\".",
      "\"In our operations centre you would seen all the red lights go, that the systems were powering down,\" he said. \"We had no information as to why.\"",
      "\"We then had a slightly later stage call from the fire department that the substation was on fire,\" he said.",
      "Heathrow is supplied by three substations, but knocking out one caused the airport to shut down.",
      "Mr Woldbye said a third of the airport was powering down and that Terminal 2 was particularly affected, along with certain central systems. He added that it became \"first and foremost a safety situation\".",
      "\"We need to make sure, when a crisis happens, that people are safe,\" he said.",
      "The safest way to proceed was to shut down airport systems, then bring them back on line, he said.",
      "The first priority was to check that no-one been caught in lifts or was hurt.",
      "Safety critical systems such as runway lighting and the control tower \"switched in as they should\", however, he said.",
      "The government has backed plans for Heathrow to build a third runway as part of efforts to boost UK economic growth.",
      "The airport would need double the amount of power for its expansion plans, Mr Woldbye said.",
      "However, Mr Wicking said airlines, which support expansion, nevertheless had concerns that it would cost \u00a340bn to \u00a360bn, and that the costs would ultimately be passed onto passengers in the form of higher fees.",
      "The danger was the expansion could turn into a \"white elephant\", he said."

      "A universal tariff of 20%, or its equivalent, would be a historic hit to the global trading system.",

      "As that has not panned out, especially in the case of China, the US is moving away from this world.",
      "If the US overplays its hand in alienating its allies today, China will be waiting. The hit to US business in Europe, for example, could be offset by cheaper electronics, clothes, and toys from the East arriving in the UK and lowering prices, diverted from the US market.",

      "There is also a Windsor Framework element to this \u2013 not on the export side because Northern Ireland goods going into the US are just UK goods.",
      "But goods coming into Northern Ireland have to meet EU rules, so you could have a situation where the UK doesn't retaliate, doesn't impose any tariffs on US goods, but the EU would retaliate.",
      "In that circumstance, US goods entering Northern Ireland would have to pay the EU tariffs but US goods entering the rest of the UK would not have to pay the tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "The start of April means several bills are going up, putting extra pressure on household finances.",
      "For some payments, such as energy, water or broadband, there are things you could do to reduce the impact of price rises.",
      "Here are seven ways you could be affected by this week's increases.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households in England and Wales are going up by \u00a310 per month on average.",
      "However, there's a lot of variation depending on your supplier.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill is jumping 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers are paying 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "The increases are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the biggest rise is coming this year.",
      "How much your bills will rise depends on a range of factors including whether households have a meter and how much water they use.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are rising by almost 10%. Scottish Water said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water.",
      "Read more: There are a number of ways you can cut your water bill, from taking showers instead of baths to checking your bill for unexplained increases.",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It covers 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but the amount you pay depends on where you live.",
      "Ofgem is suggesting households may consider switching to a fixed tariff for a bit of stability.",
      "Read more: Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap and offer certainty for a set period. But if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price.",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Birmingham, Bradford, Newham, Somerset, Trafford, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning residents face larger increases.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are are also going up, in some cases by more than 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates are jumping by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",
      "Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland's councils have reported district rate increases for the next year.",
      "Read more: There are some exemptions and discounts, for example for someone living alone and homes occupied only by students. You can also check your council tax band.",
      "4. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000.",
      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "How much is the minimum wage increasing by?",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator earlier in 2005 mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out, but prices often increase at this time of year.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile sim-only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the December 2024 inflation rate plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but anyone who took out a contract after 9 January 2025 will see their monthly bill go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50. The cost for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Car tax",
      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your vehicle excise duty will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt.",
      "EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rise.",
      "The new tax year begins on 6 April.",
      "According to the government's financial watchdog, the frozen thresholds mean that by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate.",

    "summary": "Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has announced and imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs on goods from every country of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. The 10% tariffs will take effect on 5 April, and the higher ones on 9 April.",
      "Canada and Mexico are currently exempted from these charges - but they, along with China, were already facing tariffs on some products. And the Trump administration has now expanded existing steel and aluminium tariffs to include beer and empty cans, which could hit both countries hard.",
      "On top of that, on Thursday, 25% tariffs on automobiles coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Economists have warned these levies - and those introduced in response by other countries - could push prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.",
      "Most analysts estimate that the auto tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars in the US, which reached a record average of $49,738 in December, according to Cox Automotive. As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.",
      "Even for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.",
      "Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.",
      "Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.",
      "The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.",
      "Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.",
      "Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "Modelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.",
      "Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.",
      "Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",

      "The UK will take a calm approach to US trade tariffs, rather than \"a knee-jerk reaction,\" Sir Keir Starmer has said.",
      "The prime minister suggested the UK would be affected by President Donald Trump's expected announcement on Wednesday of sweeping taxes on goods imported to the US.",
      "The UK has so far failed to negotiate an exemption, but Sir Keir said talks on a deal that could eventually see them overturned were at an \"advanced stage\".",
      "Sir Keir told his cabinet he was \"keeping all options on the table\" to respond to the tariffs, which economists have warned could damage the UK economy and increase the cost of living.",
      "UK expects to be hit by Trump tariffs, No 10 says",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "In the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said global tariffs would \"have an impact on the UK as an open trading economy\".",
      "But she insisted \"securing a deal could mitigate some of those effects\".",
      "Trump has previously raised the possibility that countries could receive \"breaks\" from tariffs - taxes that will make it more expensive to import goods into the US.",
      "But over the weekend, Trump suggested the tariffs would hit all countries, not just those with the biggest trade imbalances with the US.",
      "Trump told reporters tariffs would \"start with all countries\" on Wednesday, an event the US president has dubbed \"Liberation Day\".",
      "On Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said talks on an economic deal between the two countries to avoid tariffs had been \"constructive\", but he did not rule out retaliating if they were imposed on the UK.",
      "Earlier, Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was in the \"best possible position of any country\" to reverse the tariffs.",
      "He said: \"I do believe not only can we get to a place where we are avoiding tariffs on each other, but we're also strengthening that relationship.\"",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said a \"tit-for-tat\" approach of raising tariffs on US goods would only increase bills for British consumers.",
      "Instead, she said the government needed to focus on getting a trade deal with the US \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'No clarity'",
      "Government sources believe talks with the US administration on an economic deal have made good progress, but that at any point they risk being derailed by the president's public comments.",
      "At different times, statements by Trump about his tariffs are said to have differed from what his negotiating team had previously understood his position to be.",
      "The deal would be broader than just reducing tariffs, focusing on technology but also covering elements of trade in goods and services as well as agriculture - a controversial area in previous unsuccessful US-UK trade talks.",
      "One senior source said: \"We are pretty much there on an agreement, what we have no clarity on is when the president might sign it off or what he will do next.\"",
      "The chancellor has suggested the UK could change its taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal to avoid US tariffs.",
      "The digital services tax, introduced in 2020, imposes a 2% levy on tech firms, including big US firms such as Amazon, bringing in about \u00a3800m in tax per year.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned tariffs could wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate Reeves's buffer against her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing.",
      "The forecaster has warned that a trade war could cut the size of the British economy by 1% in the worst-case scenario.",
      "Trump has already announced a series of tariffs on steel, aluminium and vehicles coming into the US - and unlike other countries, the UK has decided not to set out plans to retaliate with tariffs of its own.",
      "But ahead of the latest round of expected tariffs, ministers are facing calls to hit back and protect UK business from the impact of Trump's taxes.",
      "Sector worries",
      "The UK pharmaceuticals industry \u2013 which exported \u00a36.6bn of medicine and related products to the US in 2024 - admitted it is \"worried\" about US tariffs.",
      "Steve Bates, chief executive of the BioIndustry Association trade body, told the BBC: \"Half of the world's market in pharmaceuticals is in the US and for the UK, exports of pharmaceuticals are about the same size of the car industry, give-or-take.\"",
      "The Scotch whisky industry is also bracing for tariffs, after being targeted by Trump during his first term.",
      "The US is the biggest market for Scotch exports, which totalled \u00a3971m last year.",
      "Annabelle Thomas, chief executive of Nc'nean Distillery on the west coast of Scotland, said large tariffs could put the company off investing in the US.",
      "She told the BBC: \"If they are lower than some were expecting, potentially we can absorb them in the short-term.",
      "\"But if they are higher, we as a small challenger brand, just don't have those resources available to us to absorb them, so we'd either need to think about raising our prices in the US or reducing our investment in the market.\""

      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

      "Primark boss Paul Marchant has resigned following an allegation by a woman about \"his behaviour towards her in a social environment\".",
      "Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns Primark, said following an investigation by external lawyers, Mr Marchant \"acknowledged his error of judgement and accepts that his actions fell below the standards expected\" by the business.",
      "Mr Marchant co-operated with the investigation and apologised to the individual, said ABF.",
      "The Primark boss had also been involved in a previous incident involving \"inappropriate communication\", ABF later confirmed.",
      "The company said that incident had been investigated \"some time ago\" and that \"proportionate action\" had been taken.",
      "ABF declined to provide any further details, including whether the incidents involved colleagues or individuals from outside the company. A spokesperson told the BBC this was to protect their identities as much as possible.",
      "'Immensely disappointed'",
      "Mr Marchant became chief executive of Primark in 2009, taking over from the firm's founder Arthur Ryan.",
      "In announcing Mr Marchant's resignation, George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"I am immensely disappointed. Colleagues and others must be treated with respect and dignity. Our culture has to be, and is, bigger than any one individual.\"",
      "He added: \"At ABF, we believe that high standards of integrity are essential. Acting responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term.\"",
      "The company said it remains in contact with the individual \"who rightly raised her concerns and have offered her our support\".",
      "While Primark - or Penneys as it is known in Ireland - has been around since 1969 when Mr Ryan opened the first shop in Dublin, it began ramping up its overseas expansion under Mr Marchant's leadership.",

      "Prior to Primark, Mr Marchant worked for a number of retailers such as Debenhams, Topman and New Look. But, like his predecessor Mr Ryan, he has remained out of the spotlight.",
      "Ms Shuttleworth said Primark's leadership \"flies under the radar a bit because - it sounds a bit cheesy - they let their shops and their products do the talking\".",
      "Unlike many of its rivals, Primark resisted selling its products online before finally relenting in 2022 after Covid restrictions drove people to internet shopping. Even then, Primark only launched a click-and-collect service as opposed to offering deliveries.",
      "Like other low-cost fashion chains, Primark has been criticised for producing cheap, throwaway clothing.",
      "In a rare interview, Mr Marchant told the BBC in 2022: \"We have worked so hard and continue to work hard on ensuring that we're improving the quality and the durability of our clothing.",
      "\"We don't want customers to buy something and then discard it. We want them to buy, love and keep it in their wardrobe [and] hand it down to their friends.\"",
      "'Unsettling'",
      "Primark is a key part of the wider ABF business, contributing nearly half of the group's overall sales of \u00a320bn.",
      "However, in its most recent trading update covering the Christmas period, Primark reported a fall in sales for the UK and Ireland, which accounts for 45% of the retailer's revenues.",
      "ABF's share price fell by nearly 4% to \u00a318.64 after Monday's announcement.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Mr Marchant's departure came at a trying time for Primark.",
      "''The change at the top will be unsettling particularly given that Primark delivered a very mixed bag of results at the last count,\" she said.",
      "\"This leadership upset comes amid weaker consumer sentiment which has meant footfall at its stores has fallen - and the chain has been losing market share in the UK.\"",
      "She said that internationally the company has performed well, but added: \"There could be uncertainty ahead about the speed of expansion given the change of boss.\"",
      "Following Mr Marchant's \"immediate\" departure, ABF's finance director Eoin Tonge will become Primark's interim chief executive.",
      "The firm's financial controller, Joana Edwards, will step into Mr Tonge's role. The company said: \"Both executives have the experience to perform these roles well.\"",

      "Trump has offered conflicting signals about the scope of the expected tariffs, which have helped drive steep declines in the US stock market over the last month.",
      "Last week, he had raised the possibility that many countries could receive \"breaks\". But over the weekend, he appeared to be leaning toward a more wide-ranging plan.",
      "\"You'd start with all countries,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. \"Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.\"",
      "The UK has said it expects to be affected by US tariffs and is not ruling out retaliating.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman has said talks on an economic deal between the two countries have been \"constructive\", but are likely to last beyond Wednesday.",
      "Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures.",
      "Concerns about the impact of the measures have unsettled markets and reignited fears of a recession in the US.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "In the US, the S&P 500 share index of the largest firms has fallen almost 10% since mid-February, making March the worst month for the index in years.",
      "The Nasdaq is down more than 10%, its worst quarter since 2022.",
      "With significant uncertainty remaining about the 2 April announcement, shares in the US opened lower but ultimately held their ground on Monday.",
      "The Dow closed up 1%, while the S&P ended up 0.5% and the Nasdaq slipped just 0.1%.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark share index closed more than 4% lower, while the Kospi in South Korea ended down 3%.",
      "In the UK, the FTSE 100 index fell nearly 0.9%, while Germany's Dax index closed down nearly 1.3% and France's Cac 40 fell roughly 1.6%.",
      "Gold, which is often seen as a safer investment when the economic backdrop is unstable, rose to another record high, hitting $3,128.06 an ounce.",
      "Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC there could be \"quite a lot of uncertainty\" for a while given that previous tariff announcements have seen a lot of changes subsequently.",
      "Japan, which is a big player in exports, is among those countries most at risk from the changes, Ms Keleman said.",
      "\"They have a lot of automakers and also a very big presence in the semiconductor market, something that hasn't really been targeted yet but that could change,\" she noted.",
      "3 million US jobs?",
      "Trump sees tariffs - which are taxes imports - as a bargaining chip to get better trade terms, while also raising money and protecting the American economy from unfair competition.",
      "A White House fact sheet published last week also suggested that a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs.",
      "Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has estimated that all the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US.",
      "Many firms have said they expect the cost of the new tax to be passed onto customers in the form of higher prices.",
      "But that could lead to lower sales and fuel inflation in the US, a problem Trump had pledged on the campaign to tackle.",
      "Conversely, if companies decide to absorb the cost, it will hit their profits.",
      "'Counter-productive'",
      "Will Butler-Adams is chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes and relies on the US for about 10% of its sales.",
      "Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes yet.",
      "But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs would make his bikes less competitive and force him to re-think his presence in the US.",
      "\"We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now,\" he said. \"We may even shrink; in the extreme, we might pull out.\"",
      "Mr Butler-Adams said it had been hard to figure out the impact of tariffs that have already gone into effect, which require detailed accounting of how much steel in each item comes from outside the US.",
      "\"The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,\" Mr Butler-Adams said.",
      "TikTok sale",
      "Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday.",
      "He set the 5 April deadline in January for the short video platform to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the US on national security grounds.",
      "It had been due to take effect that month to comply with a law passed under the Biden administration.",

      "It includes multiple cameras, eye-tracking technologies and electronics that work together to simulate scenarios from high stakes military operations.",
      "\"Everything has to be perfect,\" says the production specialist. \"So many different things can affect other things that can affect the final product in such a massive, massive way.\"",
      "Mr Barrientos works for Varjo, one of a growing number of companies in Finland developing innovations that can assist military forces and governments in preparing for or reacting to conflict.",
      "The Nordic nation, with a population of just five million, has 368 defence tech companies, according to research for Tesi, a state-funded venture capital company, released last September.",
      "Around 40% of these are start-ups and scale-ups, with many growing at rates of 30% to 40% if their tools are dual-use technologies that can also be used in other industries.",
      "Helsinki is now among the top five cities in Europe for defence, security and resilience investments, according to a separate report released in February by tech data platform Dealroom, in collaboration with the Nato Innovation Fund, an independent venture capital fund launched in 2023 with funding from 24 Nato allies.",
      "Varjo says its headsets are being used to provide 80 simulation programmes to Nato forces in the US and Europe.",
      "In simple terms, its products are more advanced versions of the virtual reality headsets used in gaming.",
      "But they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments.",
      "This \"mixed reality\" experience \"squeezes the training continuum\" for fighter pilots, says the firm's CEO Timo Toikkanen, because they no longer have to travel long distances to complete war simulations in giant aircraft hangers, which are expensive to power and run. \"You can do 99% of the same [training] inside of the headset.\"",
      "The start-up had already attracted heavy investment prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and started working with medical research companies and car manufacturers.",
      "But Mr Toikkanen says the start of the conflict and Finland's admission to Nato a year later \"just kind of put everything on steroids\" in terms of interest in its defence offering.",
      "Since March 2022 the company has raised more than \u20ac50m (\u00a342m; $54m) in additional funding.",
      "Mr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be \"kind of a red flag\" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would \"tiptoe around\" that side of the business when seeking funding.",
      "Now the opposite is now true.",
      "\"Investors are looking for companies that are active in the field of defence technology and it's not frowned upon anymore,\" he explains.",
      "Following President Trump's return to office in January, Mr Toikkanen says there's been a renewed interest in its products from European militaries in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions.",
      "\"Suddenly, there's a new understanding that we need to prepare, and we can't only rely on Nato and the United States for our defence.\"",
      "Listen: Business Daily - Finland's Defence Tech",
      "Other rapidly expanding Finnish start-ups in the defence and dual-use sectors include Iceye, which has developed fine-resolution microsatellite-based imaging and data services, and Re-orbit which supplies satellite software.",
      "Distance Technologies, a start-up backed by Google creates headset-free immersive technologies. In March it announced a collaboration with Patria, a Finnish legacy defence firm, which will trial the tech on its armoured vehicles.",
      "Finland shares around 1,340 km (830 miles) of its border with Russia, and the Finnish government spent a greater proportion of its budget on defence than many other European countries even before the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"There's a phrase I like to leverage, which is 'the tyranny of geography' - the closer you are to a threat, the more likely you are to perceive it as more apparent and indeed more existential,\" says Nicholas Nelson, a UK-based defence tech investor and visiting fellow at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"They also have a memory of the Winter War, which transpired during World War Two, where they were invaded by the Soviet Union.\"",
      "The duty of Finns to defend their country is enshrined in the Finnish constitution, and there is mandatory military service for men.",
      "Mr Nelson believes this exposure may also have encouraged talented citizens to become founders or investors in defence tech, rather than other fast-growing industries in Europe such as renewable energy or financial technologies.",
      "At Maria 01, a former hospital turned startup campus in Helsinki, entrepreneur Janne Hietala opens his laptop to scroll through images of unmanned airships gathering data above snow-covered Arctic forests.",
      "He is the CEO of Kelluu, a company that originally expected its technology to be used by climate researchers, but pivoted to becoming a surveillance platform targeted at cities, governments and research institutions in 2022.",
      "\"It was a very concrete, personal feeling that we need to also do something for the security situation,\" says Mr Hietala.",
      "He highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this \"spirit to be ready to defend\" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth.",
      "Defence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country.",
      "Many of the country's tech alumni \u2013 including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo \u2013 honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland.",
      "It ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies.",
      "Although not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell.",
      "There is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing \u20ac120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups.",
      "\"Our current government\u2026 they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,\" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. \"I think they understand the urgency.\"",
      "Despite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges.",
      "Mr Hietala, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a \"culture clash\" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies.",
      "\"That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed.\"",
      "At Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses.",
      "But while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far.",

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",

      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",

      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",

      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",

      "She'd like to buy a car now, she said, but \"I have to wait until my finances improve\".",
      "Ms Dillard is among the plethora of Americans bracing for expected economic turbulence under President Donald Trump's sweeping auto tariffs - an unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre.",
      "\"It took me a long time to save up for the last car,\" she said. \"If prices get too high, I'm obviously not going to buy something that I can't afford.\"",
      "She added: \"We'll just have to wait and see.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts entering the US from overseas, which go into effect on 2 April.",
      "Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Trump and members of his administration have argued that the tariffs will lead to \"tremendous growth\" and increase jobs in the US.",

      "\"It's going to get worse.\"",
      "A car that would sell for $13,000 (\u00a310,000) might rise to $14,500 (\u00a311,200) because of the tariffs, Mr Husseini said. He predicted that consumers will see prices increase in the next three to six weeks.",
      "The auto tariffs will likely force car dealers like Mr Husseini to raise prices.",
      "\"We all still have bills to pay, mouths to feed and employees to pay,\" he said.",

      "\"I don't think I would buy a car made in the United States just because of the tariffs, I think I would probably wait a few years until things settle down,\" Ms Sloan said.",
      "From buyers to dealers, the effects of the tariffs will be widespread, for better or for worse, experts say.",
      "In the US, there are 908 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. About 92% of households own a vehicle.",
      "Car ownership is typically higher in the US than in Europe, surveys suggest, partly because, in the absence of extensive public transport, many Americans have no other choice of how to get around.",
      "Cars are also more than just a means of transportation. As symbols of both freedom and success, cars have a unique place in the national identity, from the show Pimp My Ride to Janice Joplin singing \"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz\".",

      "Higher-end imported vehicles, such as Audis, BMWs and Mercedes, will increase in price, too, Prof Heitmann said, though many of those who buy from such brands might be able to absorb a heftier price tag.",
      "A 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%.",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.",
      "Despite efforts from some car makers - including Ford and General Motors - to discourage Trump enacting auto tariffs, the president is forging ahead.",

      "On Tuesday, Hyundai, the South Korean car-marker, announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US by building a new steel plant in Louisiana.",
      "Trump said the move is a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".",
      "But the tariffs are likely to impact the domestic car industry as well.",
      "US auto manufacturing has been deeply intertwined with industries in Canada and Mexico for decades. Parts criss-cross the borders several times before they are assembled, which means that even a vehicle as iconically American as a Ford pickup truck could see a sticker price increase.",
      "Ultimately, Trump's tariff strategy will thrust the US auto industry into uncharted territory, leaving uncertainty hanging over consumers, dealers and automakers until they go into effect on Wednesday.",
      "\"Everything's topsy turvy now, you know, and it's also terribly filled with uncertainty, because no one exactly knows what kind of game is really being played by the Trump administration related to all the bluster of these tariffs,\" Prof Heitmann said.",
      "Some, like Mya Fountain-Bunch, just want to get through the unease. She took her car into a dealership this week to avoid needing a replacement after the tariffs hit.",

    "story": [
      "A range of household bills, including council tax, water, gas and electricity have risen today.",
      "The BBC's cost of living correspondent, Kevin Peachey, has been answering your most asked questions on the price rises.",
      "Why are bills going up?",
      "Tashi and Chris asked why bills are going up.",
      "This is a very simple question, but I'm afraid the answer isn't straightforward. There are a host of reasons why bills are rising.",
      "On energy, it's the consequence of an increase in wholesale prices paid by suppliers, often owing to global events.",
      "Councils and water companies, meanwhile, say there's a desperate need to raise bills to pay for investment in services.",
      "Some bill increases are always scheduled for this time of year, to match the rate of rising prices - inflation.",
      "So another question is: what can you do about it?",
      "Consumer groups are urging people to shop around, claim everything they are entitled to, and cut back where possible.",
      "We have a guide to help you here.",
      "Is cash a better way to budget?",
      "James: I get \u00a3150 in cash out every week. It's amazing how it helps you budget things. Why don't more people try it?",
      "There is evidence of people turning to notes and coins to help them budget.",
      "Although cash use was hit during the pandemic, it has made a bit of a comeback, with many people taking the same view as James.",
      "However, there are areas in which this doesn't work.",
      "Shopping around for a better deal on essential bills is often something done online, and may require signing up to a direct debit payment. Rewards, or money off, are often also available to those who pay by card.",
      "So, it may well be that using a mix of ways to pay works best - but questions remain about access to cash and internet services among the vulnerable.",
      "Will my wage rise be eaten away by tax?",
      "Richard Kendall asked about frozen tax thresholds, which mean pay rises can see people drawn into paying higher rates of income tax.",
      "This is what is known as fiscal drag - not a phrase you'll hear talked about much, but it is important.",
      "It means that while income tax rates haven't risen, the income levels at which they are paid have been frozen, and will continue to be so until 2028.",
      "There have been rumours that the freeze could be extended, but there are no concrete plans for that as yet.",
      "So, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of tax, or simply having a greater proportion of their income taxed.",
      "Taking a closer look at your pay slip is worthwhile, and it needs to be considered when looking at your personal budget. Experts say studying exactly how much post-tax income is coming in, and looking at it alongside your spending, is never a waste of time.",
      "And it may require you to trim some of your spending. Shopping around, or cancelling unused subscriptions are a good start, experts say.",
      "Do we just have to accept water bill increases?",
      "Colin Smith: Do we simply have to accept water bill increases because we can't shop around?",
      "Water services are different, because the 'switch for a better deal' advice simply doesn't, ahem, hold water.",
      "There is plenty of debate over why water bills are going up so much (remember some suppliers wanted bigger increases).",
      "But there are things you can do to keep your costs down, even though you can't shop around.",
      "Experts say getting a water meter fitted can reduce bills if you have relatively low usage. Water-saving shower heads, or similar, are available free from some companies.",
      "Then, there is the WaterSure scheme, which means the bill is capped for people on certain benefits, who have a medical condition, or who have a certain number of school-age children at home. You do need to apply for this help though.",
      "Does this hit the government's plans for growth?",
      "Sam Halkyard, 32, from Rotherham: How does the government expect the economy to grow with all these bill increases?",
      "Ministers are pushing their \"agenda for growth\" at every opportunity, calling for red tape to be cut to pave the way for investment.",
      "There is a delicate balancing act here. The government wants people's living standards to rise, and it wants them to spend to encourage investment by businesses.",
      "Remember, all of this comes with a background of wage rises outpacing prices, an uptick in the housing market, and some signs of hope for the wider economy.",
      "But ministers won't want to see a return of runaway inflation - the annual rise of prices - because that would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals.",
      "So, outside of this, you are seeing the government push ahead with some big, long-term investment projects, like road tunnels and runways.",
      "I'm single, where's help for me?",
      "Jules, 57: I'm single. My wages don't go up in April. Where's the help for us?",
      "Charities have raised the alarm specifically about people like you, Jules.",
      "Citizens Advice says that single households, including single parents, tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on household bills.",
      "As a result, there is far less wriggle room financially when bills rise.",
      "One solution is to investigate all the options that are open to you. For example, as I'm sure you already know if it includes you, there is a 25% discount on council tax, for those who live on their own.",
      "But there is, without doubt, a single person premium on the cost of living because there's only one income coming in, so it may be harder to deal with the money going out.",

      "This is a household cost which many people feel is unfair - not least because there is nothing you can do about it.",
      "Standing charges are the fees charged to all billpayers to cover the cost of being connected to a gas and electricity supply. They are unaffected by the amount of energy that a household uses.",
      "After rising sharply in recent years, the average electricity standing charge actually fell from today - although it rose slightly for gas. More significantly, it varies considerably depending on where you live.",
      "The energy regulator, Ofgem, is considering reform that would allow people a choice of ways to pay - but stresses that these costs will still need to be covered.",
      "Council tax: What do I get for it?",
      "Ian Griffiths, from Flintshire, on council tax: Other than having my bin emptied once a fortnight, I don't actually have anything for the money I pay.",
      "In Wales, local authorities are increasing 2025-2026 council tax bills by between 5% and more than 9%.",
      "Ian may be stretching his point a little - local authorities provide a range of services such as street lighting, parks and care services.",
      "However, at its heart, his question highlights a common debate.",
      "Should these bill increases stay at the bare minimum because people are struggling financially, or are our local services in such desperate need of investment that council tax needs to go up above inflation?",
      "Are pensioners facing a harder hit?",
      "Lyn Nailer: Will pensioners suffer the most from these bill rises?",
      "One important point to stress here is that different people, in different areas of the country, will be affected in different ways.",
      "Water and energy bills vary depending on where you live, and the different nations of the UK have different rules on council tax and more.",
      "But the state pension is UK-wide, and the good news is that it will be going up by more than the rate of price rises from next week. The triple lock means it will increase by 4.1%.",
      "Does everyone get the full state pension? No.",
      "Does the increase mean pensioners' finances won't be stretched? Of course not.",
      "But when asked about how people will cope, ministers are inevitably pointing to this increase as evidence of how the government is helping out.",
      "What about the minimum wage increase?",
      "David and Steve pointed out that incomes are rising, including via an increase of the minimum wage.",
      "Yes, it is not all doom and gloom today.",
      "There is an increase in the minimum wage - up to \u00a312.21 an hour for over 21s - and there are increases too for younger workers and apprentices.",
      "Official figures show that average wages have been rising faster than prices. The state pension and benefits will also go up from next week.",
      "This will certainly help pay some of those bills, and you won't see the impact directly until you look at your bank balance in the coming weeks.",
      "The Treasury is also pointing to moves to freeze fuel duty and ensure the main rates of tax - income tax, VAT and employees' National Insurance - do not go up during this Parliament, as evidence of the support billpayers are receiving.",
      "Is there a silver lining?",
      "Bills may be rising - but for some people, incomes are going up too.",
      "Benefits and the state pension are going up in a week's time. Wages have also been rising at a faster pace than the rate of inflation, and the start of April also brings an increase in the minimum wage. It means:",
      "The minimum wage for over 21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, has risen by 6.7%, from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21 an hour.

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",

      "However, other measures also needed attention, he said, including the fact significantly fewer Welsh 18-year-olds were applying to university compared with their English counterparts.",
      "The shortfall amounted to the equivalent of up to 4,500 students, according to Dr Calvert.",

      "\"It doesn't necessarily send a signal to people around educational aspiration.\"",
      "He said the Seren programme was \"aimed at high achieving students who would already go to university\".",
      "\"It's effectively a programme which takes an awful lot of students into Russell Group institutions in England,\" he added.",
      "\"I think we need a programme that works for all, that deals, perhaps more specifically with learners who are asking questions about whether university is for them at all.",

      "\"I think equipping students with the mindset of going out of Wales is not necessarily a bad thing because I think a lot of students will come back to invest their skillset back into Wales,\" he said.",
      "\"If you go back to the nuts and bolts of what Seren provides it is about giving students exposure and confidence to higher education.",
      "\"It's all about raising aspirations and showcasing to students the range of opportunities they have whether that's inside Wales or outside Wales.\"",
      "Sixth formers in Ysgol Godre'r Berwyn in Bala, Gwynedd, are currently preparing for their exams while looking ahead to the next step after leaving school.",

    "summary": "Pronatalists have long courted controversy - but since Trump was sworn in for the second time, the evangelising of some members of this controversial fringe group has reached new levels.",
    "story": [
      "Pronatalists, a controversial fringe group almost exclusively from the political right, claim that some of the most powerful people in the US government are sympathetic to their cause. But how much influence do they really have?",
      "Listen to Stephanie read this article",
      "Simone Collins is sitting in her 18th century cottage in Pennsylvania, dressed in a black pilgrim pinafore with a wide collar, bouncing one of her four children on her lap. It is 8.30am and she looks a little tired \u2013 she runs several businesses, a foundation and is currently pregnant with her fifth child, though she and her husband Malcolm plan to have more.",
      "\"At least seven,\" she declares, \"and as many as I can physically carry - 12 would be even more brilliant.\"",
      "The US couple, aged 37 and 38, ardently believe that the world needs to have more babies or risk civilisational collapse. They have become the poster children for pronatalism, a movement that believes falling birth rates are a big problem for society. And that big families are the answer.",
      "For the last five years, they have spread the word about their goal by opening up their home for interviews and photoshoots. They claim to have used special technology, during the IVF process, to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence.",
      "\"The studies let us know what our genetic predilection for IQ is,\" they told an undercover reporter in 2023. \"We will never choose a child who is less privileged in IQ than either of us.\"",
      "Speaking today, however, Malcolm admits, \"The easiest way to [spread the word about pronatalism] was to turn ourselves into a meme... If we take a reasonable approach to things and say things are nuanced, nobody engages. And then we go and say something outrageous and offensive and everyone's into it.\"",
      "But since Donald Trump was sworn in as US President for the second time earlier this year, they have taken their evangelising to a new level. The Collinses now see certain people in the White House as potential allies - and they fully intend to capitalise on that.",
      "Elon Musk, who is said to have fathered 14 children, has called fertility decline \"the biggest danger civilisation faces, by far\". He has donated $10m (\u00a37.75m) to the Population Wellbeing Initiative in Texas, which conducts research into fertility, parenting, and the future of population growth.",
      "The US Vice President JD Vance has also spoken openly about his views on procreation. At an anti-abortion rally in January he declared: \"I want more babies in the United States of America.\"",
      "There are early indications that the Trump administration is prioritising family too. On 18 February, Trump signed an executive order to improve access for IVF that recognised \"the importance of family formation and that our nation's public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children\".",
      "Pronatalists are buoyed by this and many hope it is a sign of things to come.",
      "The facts of fertility decline are clear. The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. That will have a profound effect on society and our economies. Some people believe we can adapt over time to this new reality, but pronatalists are less sanguine.",
      "But there is a political element to the movement too. Pronatalists are almost exclusively from the political right. Malcolm and Simone Collins, for example, describe themselves as former liberals who became disillusioned with progressive, \"woke\" politics.",
      "They see themselves as pragmatic and profoundly anti-bureaucratic.",
      "\"We are a coalition of people who are incredibly different in our philosophies, our theological beliefs, our family structures,\" says Malcolm. \"But the one thing we agree on is that our core enemy is the urban monoculture; the leftist unifying culture.\"",
      "So, could this fringe group really gain the ear of some of the most powerful people in the US government? And if so, just how much soft power could they have to influence policy not only around population decline but about wider issues too?",
      "Vance, Musk and the 'Fertilisation President'",
      "Last weekend, a group of roughly 200 pronatalists congregated in Texas for the second Natal Conference, an annual weekend-long event that cost around $1,000 (\u00a3775) to attend.",
      "The conference brings together two strands in pronatalism that come from very different branches of the American right: both conservative Christians and members of the so-called 'tech right,' an ascendant wing that came out of the libertarian, start-up culture of Silicon Valley.",
      "Some are connected to the current US government. Michael Anton was appointed by Trump as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. He spoke at last year's conference.",
      "Other speakers at this year's conference included Carl Benjamin, who has links to far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and Charles Cornish-Dale, an influencer who goes by the name Raw Egg Nationalist.",
      "\"It's like an unholy alliance,\" says Catherine Pakaluk, an economist, mother of eight and stepmother of six. She too spoke at the conference but is reluctant to call herself a pronatalist. \"It's a complicated movement and includes people with very different positions,\" she says.",
      "One thing they have in common, however, is that they all want their message to be heard at the highest levels of government.",
      "Some believe they already are being heard. \"[If you ask me] do we have pronatalists in the White House right now who are pushing policy,\" says Malcolm, \"my response to this would be, 'I mean, duh, like Elon and JD Vance'.\"",
      "In President Trump's executive orders to date, there has been little apart from the order on IVF that could be seen as directly pro-family. But pronatalist thinking may be starting to influence policy that is less explicitly about fertility.",
      "In January, the US transportation secretary Sean Duffy circulated a memo instructing his department to \"give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\" when awarding grants.",
      "Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, sees the influence of JD Vance in that policy. \"Vance comes at it from a long history of pro-family thinking and policymaking,\" he says.",
      "Vance has often spoken about the need to fix a \"broken culture\" that is tearing the US family apart, by undermining men.",
      "In a recent interview, he said: \"We actually think God made male and female for a purpose and we want you guys to thrive as young men and young women and we're going to help with our public policy to make it possible to do that.\"",
      "This idea has been echoed in pronatalist circles.",
      "\"Vance is a vocal pronatalist,\" says Rachel Cohen, policy correspondent at Vox. \"Trump himself campaigned on implementing a new \"baby boom\" and last week he declared himself the 'fertilisation president'.\"",
      "The pronatalists drafting DIY executive orders",
      "Malcolm says he has already made attempts to influence the White House. He claims to have engaged in \"backroom channelling of influential people, making sure that pronatalism became normal to talk about within the centres of power, and that ended up dripping its way up to administration and core tech culture\".",
      "They are in discussions on pronatalist policy with the Heritage Foundation. Then there is a rather more direct approach they claim to have taken. \"We have submitted draft executive orders to the Trump administration,\" says Simone.",
      "Their proposals include suggestions for how to remove layers of regulation from childcare providers and expanding car seat choice so cars can fit more children.",
      "The couple aren't sure if those are going to translate into anything concrete just yet \u2013 but they believe they have a receptive audience.",
      "Their connection to power is thanks to the so-called tech right, a reactionary movement against liberalism led by some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Those in the tech right include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2013 who sponsored Vance's Senate race and has invested in fertility technology \u2013 and venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen.",
      "Simone Collins was formerly the managing director of an exclusive members' club run by Mr Thiel, and the couple say they ran two other invite-only networking groups for business elites. Their Pronatalist Foundation, founded in 2021, received just under $500,000 (\u00a3387,000) through a fund of the Skype co-founder, Estonian billionaire Jann Tallinn.",
      "\"The tech right bring a lot of energy to the discussion,\" says Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at the Heritage Foundation. \"We've been discussing how we could blend these various strains on the right. We're trying to cohere the movement.\"",
      "Cracks in the pronatalist alliance",
      "There are, however, cracks in the alliance which add to the challenge of trying to make the movement \u201ccoherent\u201d.",
      "Many on the traditional religious right have misgivings about the use of IVF and disagree with embryo screening, while some also oppose gay marriage and parenthood.",
      "\"It's just an odd alliance of people who seem to agree on this one point: that the birth rate is too low. But there are wildly different prescriptions and ideas about what might be done to fix it,\" says Ms Pakaluk.",
      "\"There's a renewed interest in pronatalism and family promotion among American conservatives,\" says Timothy Carney, author of Family Unfriendly, How our Culture Made Raising Kids Much Harder than it Needs to Be. But he adds: \"There will definitely be tensions.\"",
      "One of those most divisive issues in pronatalism are the mention of certain aspects related to genetics among some of its tech right proponents. It's something that has prompted concern, in particular around the ethics of this, on all sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the right-leaning American Ethics and Public Policy Centre working on pro-family policy, suggests that the executive order to improve access to IVF could show the influence of the tech-right on policy. But he has his concerns about that influence, particularly around embryo screening. \"Turning children into consumer products is something that I really worry about,\" he says. \"That leads to a troublesome place.\"",
      "Some of those attending the recent conference describe themselves as \"race realists\", and one has published offensive views alleging a link between intelligence and race that, according to many scientists, are plain wrong.",
      "Geneticist Adam Rutherford describes the data used as \"fraudulent and racist, drawn from hopeless sample sizes that wouldn't constitute valid scientific evidence to anyone vaguely interested in truth.",
      "\"These assertions are recapitulations of historical ideas of scientific racism.\"",
      "The associations with extreme views in the movement is one of the reasons some people don't like to call themselves pronatalists. Catherine Pakaluk is one of them. \"I think there probably are some people who are just pure eugenicists or white supremacists,\" she says.",
      "\"I find it disgusting and reprehensible and I have no interest in ever being aligned with people like that.\"",
      "Could controversy translate into soft power?",
      "The question that remains is, where does all of this leave pronatalists - and just how much power do they wield?",
      "According to some onlookers, their impact is already being felt. \"There's definitely strong influence from pronatalists in the Trump White House,\" claims Ms Cohen. \"I think an outstanding question is how this will all overlap with efforts to restrict birth control and contraception, and how this will affect debates around spending like on childcare funding.\"",
      "Mr Carney is more circumspect: \"Vance is very pro-family and very pronatalist, and he wants the government to promote families and to help drive up the birth rate - but JD Vance is not the president. I don't think Donald Trump has firm conviction on this.\"",
      "He also believes there might be resistance to some pro-family policies, pointing out that at least some of the Republicans in control of Congress don't like the idea of family support. \"They think that it's welfare to the undeserving.\"",
      "The attention gleaned by the Collinses, and by the recent conference, is undoubtable. But one expert suggests they are doing little more than stirring up controversy.",
      "\"If you go to Capitol Hill, and talk to members of Congress or governors in states across America, they don't necessarily even recognise the problem,\" argues Mr Brown.",
      "As he puts it, \"the incentives of the internet\" aren't always the incentives of a successful mass movement. \"And what gets attention is provocation and being edgy and crossing the line. That gets clicks, that gets followers.",

    "story": [
      "Financial worries and disagreements about fundraising helped inflame the row that has engulfed the charity founded by Prince Harry, insiders close to former trustees told BBC News.",
      "An acrimonious boardroom battle has seen Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince  Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resign from their roles at the charity and insiders claimed personality clashes and tensions around leadership of the charity added to Sentebale's challenges.",
      "The financial fears were despite the charity receiving an extra \u00a31.2m from Prince Harry's earnings from his best-selling memoir Spare.",
      "Sentebale said it had successfully hired consultants to find new US donors \u2013 and the one-off money from Spare was \"incredibly useful\"  but did not represent a long-term \"funding pipeline\".",
      "The claims and counter-claims over Sentebale are set to be examined by the Charity Commission, which will have to decide whether to escalate the concerns to a full statutory inquiry.",
      "The watchdog is likely to hear financial concerns from former trustees, who resigned earlier this month after the chair Sophie Chandauka refused to step down.",
      "\"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" said a statement from those trustees leaving the charity.",
      "Among the likely claims are that \u00a3500,000 of Sentebale's money was spent on consultants in a strategy to get donations from wealthy individuals and foundations in the US, but which sources close to former trustees say had not delivered results.",
      "Insiders say that if the US fundraising strategy had worked this crisis in running the charity might have been averted.",
      "Ms Chandauka has widely used the title \"Dr\" both for the Sentebale charity and other business settings. This is a reference to an honorary award from Coventry University and is not an academic or medical qualification.",
      "A spokeswoman for Sentebale told the BBC that the use of \"Dr\" was a \"matter of personal choice\" and there was \"no legal restriction preventing honorary degree recipients from using the title\".",
      "A Sentebale spokeswoman rejected the claim that \u00a3500,000 had been spent on US consultants - and defended its approach to seeking new funds for a charity.",
      "The charity told the BBC that it had hired a US firm called Lebec to help build a new fundraising strategy, and that by October 2024 a team of six consultants had set up 65 key relationships with potential donors, who might help Sentebale in the future.",
      "It said the 12-month deal with Lebec, a women-led strategy firm, had successfully delivered links to \"high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporations, foundations and partner non-profits\".",
      "\"Lebec provided the positioning strategy, the tools, and the insights to enter the US market successfully and with credibility,\" said a spokeswoman for Sentebale.",
      "The shift to larger-scale US funding would appear to be a different style of approach from Sentebale's fundraising polo matches and celebrity events associated with Prince Harry.",
      "Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resigned from their roles at Sentebale, as a \"result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board\".",
      "They left a charity which was set up in 2006 to help young people in southern Africa living with HIV and Aids, a project which had strong emotional ties for Prince Harry and the legacy of his mother Princess Diana.",
      "Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso said they were resigning from the charity with \"heavy hearts\".",
      "Insiders say that relationships had been \"fraught\" by last autumn.",
      "The trustees' walkout followed Ms Chandauka's refusal to step down as chair - and she responded with her own claims against her former colleagues.",
      "She accused Prince Harry of trying to oust her and said she had raised her concerns with the Charity Commission, with a \"whistleblower complaint about the bullying, the harassment and the misogyny\".",
      "Ms Chandauka argued that the controversy around Prince Harry leaving the UK had meant that he had become a barrier to funding from donors.",
      "\"It was pretty obvious to me that we had lost quite a number of corporate sponsors,\" she said in a Sky News interview.",
      "Ms Chandauka also spoke about a dispute over a video at a fundraising polo match, where it had been claimed the Duchess of Sussex was manoeuvring her out of the way during a prize giving.",
      "The body language seemed to be a sign of other tensions.",
      "\"Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the duchess and I said I wouldn't,\" said Ms Chandauka, who said she did not want the charity to be used as an extension of the publicity for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.",
      "There were other tussles over whether Prince Harry had caused disruption by wanting to bring a Netflix TV crew to a fundraising event.",
      "But sources close to those who have left the charity do not accept that version of events.",
      "If the Charity Commission announces it is going ahead with a \"regulatory compliance case\", it will gather evidence about the claims over how Sentebale has been managed and will decide whether the investigation needs to be escalated to the next level of a statutory inquiry.",
      "Ms Chandauka has argued that the charity can continue without its founders and needs to change its focus to reflect the current needs in southern Africa. A friend of Prince Harry's says he feels as though \"he's had one of his fingers cut off\".",

      "The prime minister has told the makers of hit Netflix drama Adolescence that it was \"really hard to watch\" with his teenage children, as he hosted a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the show, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, served as \"a torch that shines intensely brightly on a combination of issues that many people don't know how to respond to\".",
      "But he warned there was not a \"silver bullet response\" or \"some policy lever that can be pulled\".",
      "Sir Keir also welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools.",
      "The programme has sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and \"manosphere\" influencers.",
      "Jack Thorne, who wrote the show with actor Stephen Graham, recently said the prime minister should \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",

      "The prime minister told them the show was \"at times harrowing\" but had \"lit a touch paper\" under the debate about the issues.",

      "It shone a light \"on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn in to this world\", he said.",
      "But unlike some things the government deals with, \"there isn't an obvious policy response which will answer all of these questions\", he added.",
      "\"It's much broader than that. It's a cultural issue, and therefore we're going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why I'm really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it.\"",
      "Netflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film+ schools streaming service.",
      "Asked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97% of schools were already doing that - so it was \"not, to my mind, the central issue\".",
      "\"If we're going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether you're at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing? Because that, for me, is the critical issue,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "London's cultural scene was among the sectors hardest hit when the first Covid lockdown began in March 2020, and five years on some in the industry say it is still finding its feet.",
      "Those working on theatre productions were among the workers facing the most uncertainty with many on freelance contracts and not knowing when the curtains would go up again.",
      "\"It was just absolutely horrendous because we didn't know how long it was going to last,\" theatre producer Eleanor Lloyd said.",
      "\"The income went from a very healthy business that we'd been running here already for a year and a half, to zero income - I mean absolutely nothing.\"",
      "Ms Lloyd, who produces Witness for the Prosecution on the West End, said theatres faced many false starts over the course of the pandemic which added to the uncertainty for her and her 45 employees.",
      "Some in the sector went on to find other forms of income, including actor Serene Sabah who decided to open an ice cream parlour.",
      "\"I remember having a conversation on a Zoom [call] with other theatre makers where we were being told that it might be that we never go to their theatre again,\" she said.",
      "\"Will it ever come back?\"",
      "Despite being among the hardest hit, theatre-goers did come back and relatively quickly, with numbers surpassing pre-pandemic as soon as 2022, according to the Creative Industries Council.",
      "With the creative industries generating \u00a350bn a year for London's economy, the lockdowns had much wider knock-on effects across the city.",
      "Justine Simons, City Hall's deputy mayor for culture, told BBC London that \"culture had long-Covid\".",
      "\"A lot of the industry had to take on debt,\" she said.",
      "\"There were a lot of job losses. This is an industry that's a very freelance industry, lots of small businesses and they were the types of businesses and jobs that got hit really hard.\"",
      "She said City Hall is investing \u00a310m to help boost the sector to \"help it to continue to recover\".",
      "Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NITA), said: \"I don't think we've been given a chance to recover.\"",
      "He said the nightlife industry has moved from the challenges of lockdowns into a \"cost of operating crisis\" because of the rising costs, such as energy, and the rises in employer's national insurance contributions and the national living wage, which takes affect from 1 April.",
      "\"Many of them have just never had a chance to really get sight or of a recovery,\" Mr Kill added.",
      "While the nightclub industry has been in overall decline in recent years, the owner of a recently opened venue in Kensington, west London, is more optimistic.",
      "Barth Rougier said: \"We are witnessing a real positive culture shift where people are really begging for more spaces, more spaces to communicate with others and socialise.",
      "\"The headlines have been negative over the past few years.",
      "\"Places are shutting down, venues are shutting all around the UK and I think it's time we all took responsibility and come together and shine a light on the culture and socialising spaces.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 2019 Srija became the first transgender woman to legally marry in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu after a historic court ruling. Now a new documentary, Amma's Pride, chronicles Srija's battle for state recognition of her marriage and the unwavering support of her mother, Valli.",
      "\"Srija is a gift,\" Valli, 45, tells the BBC as she and her daughter embrace.",
      "\"I know that not all trans people have what I have,\" Srija, 25, from the port city of Thoothukudi, adds.",
      "\"My education, my job, my marriage - everything was possible because of my mother's support.\"",
      "She and her mother are sharing their story for the first time in Amma's Pride (Mother's Pride), which follows Srija's unique experience.",
      "'I will always stand by my daughter'",
      "Srija met her future husband, Arun, at a temple in 2017. After learning they shared mutual friends they soon began texting each other regularly. She was already out as transgender and had begun her transition.",
      "\"We talked a lot. She confided in me about her experiences as a trans woman,\" Arun tells the BBC.",
      "Within months, they fell in love and decided they wanted to spend their lives together.",
      "\"We wanted legal recognition because we want a normal life like every other couple,\" Srija says. \"We want all the protections that come from a legal recognition of marriage.\"",
      "That incudes securities, such as the transfer of money or property if one spouse dies.",
      "In 2014, the Indian Supreme Court established certain protections for transgender people, granting them equal rights to education, employment, healthcare and marriage - although India still does not allow same-sex marriages.",
      "It's not known how many trans couples have married in India, or who was the first. Activists say there was at least one trans wedding legally registered before Srija and Arun's - in 2018 a couple married in Bangalore.",
      "\"Of course there are queer couples, or transgender couples, all over India,\" says the director of Amma's Pride, Shiva Krish, but because of continuing discrimination \"several are secretive about their relationship. Srija and Arun, and Valli, are unique in choosing to live their everyday life out in the open.\"",
      "Srija and Arun's attempt to register their 2018 wedding was rejected, with the registrar arguing that the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act defined marriage as a union between a \"bride\" and a \"groom\", which therefore excluded trans women.",
      "But the couple, backed by LGBT activists, pushed back, taking their relationship into the public domain. The effort was worth it.",
      "They received global attention in 2019 when the Madras High Court in Chennai upheld their right to marry, stating that transgender people should be recognised as either a \"bride\" or \"groom\" as defined by the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act.",
      "The ruling was seen by LGBT activists as a pivotal step in the acceptance of transgender people in India, with Srija and Arun both becoming well known locally for challenging cultural norms.",
      "But media coverage also invited negative scrutiny.",
      "\"The day after local news coverage, I was fired from my job,\" says Arun, who worked as a manual labourer in the transport sector. He believes it was due to transphobia.",
      "Online trolling followed.",
      "\"People sent abusive messages criticising me for being married to a transgender woman,\" he says.",
      "The couple briefly separated under the strain.",
      "Despite this, Srija excelled at her education, frequently coming first in class at high school.",
      "She went on to complete a degree in English literature from a university in Tamil Nadu, becoming one of the only people in her family to receive higher education.",
      "It's a source of pride for Valli, who left school aged 14.",
      "Even before battling to have her marriage recognised by the state, Srija and her family faced hostility and mistreatment.",
      "After Srija came out as a transgender woman at the age of 17, she and her mother and younger brother, China, were evicted from their home by their landlord.",
      "Several family members stopped speaking to them.",
      "But Srija's mother and brother were steadfast in their support.",
      "\"I will always stand by my daughter,\" says Valli.",
      "\"All trans people should be supported by their family.\"",
      "Valli, who became a single parent when her husband died when Srija was just six, works in a kitchen at a school.",
      "But despite earning a modest income, she helped pay for her daughter's gender reassignment, in part by selling some of her jewellery, and cared for her afterwards.",
      "\"She takes good care of me,\" Srija says.",
      "'Hopefully mindsets will change'",
      "There are thought to be about two million transgender people in India, the world's most populous country, although activists say the number is higher.",
      "While the country has passed trans-inclusive legislation and recognised in law a \"third gender\", stigma and discrimination remain.",
      "Studies have found transgender people in India face high rates of abuse, mental health issues, and limited access to education, employment, and healthcare. Many are forced to beg or enter sex work.",
      "Globally, the UN says significant numbers of transgender people face rejection from their families.",
      "\"Not a lot of trans people in India, or even the world, have the support of their families,\" says filmmaker, Shiva Krish.",
      "\"Srija and Valli's story is unique.\"",
      "Srija says she hopes the film will help challenge stereotypes about trans people and the types of stories that are often promoted in the media about the group - especially those that focus on trauma and abuse.",
      "\"This documentary shows that we can be leaders. I am a manager, a productive member of the workforce,\" Srija says.",
      "\"When people see new kinds of stories on trans people, hopefully their mindsets will also change.\"",
      "'I'd like to become a grandmother soon'",
      "After premiering at international film festivals, Amma's Pride was shown at a special screening in Chennai, for members of the LGBT community and allies, to mark International Trans Day of Visibility on Monday 31 March.",
      "Following the Chennai screening, a workshop was held where participants in small groups discussed family acceptance and community support for trans individuals.",
      "\"We hope our screening events will foster connections between trans individuals, their families, and local communities,\" adds Chithra Jeyaram, another one of the filmmakers behind Amma's Pride.",
      "The Amma's Pride production team hope that the universal themes of family support in the face of stigma means the documentary and workshops can be rolled out to rural audiences, as well as other cities in India, and neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bangladesh.",
      "As for Srija and Arun, they now work as managers for private companies and hope to adopt a child soon. \"We're hoping for a normal future,\" says Srija.",
      "\"I would like to become a grandmother soon,\" Valli adds, smiling."

    "story": [
      "Inside a soundstage once used by silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand, Hollywood executives, actors and filmmakers sipped cocktails as they marvelled at what some say is the biggest breakthrough since the talkies: AI-generated video.",
      "But whether AI will be the future, or the end, of cinema is still up for debate.",
      "It was only two years ago that actors and writers shut down Hollywood with strikes demanding protections from AI. Now the technology is controversially creeping into TV, movies and video games. Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology.",
      "As a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders with actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.",
      "AI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool Marey by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.",
      "\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".",
      "Artificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In The Terminator, AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on earth.",
      "But it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.",
      "OpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organisations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.",
      "\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says.",
      "Hollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.",
      "The technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.",
      "But the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",
      "If you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".",
      "At the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from west Los Angeles, even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.",
      "\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"",
      "Mooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.",
      "\"This technology is utterly meaningless without the artist at the centre of it; the technology needs to ultimately be subservient to the artist,\" says Talukdar.",
      "Hollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States.",
      "Tech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.",
      "Google and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.",
      "Hollywood filmmakers say tech companies are attempting to undermine the entertainment industry, which they point out supports more than 2.3 million US jobs.",
      "\"We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,\" a group of more than 400 Hollywood A-listers - led by actress/writer Natasha Lyonne who helped develop Moonvalley - wrote in an open letter to the Trump administration, which has been soliciting public comment for its AI Action Plan.",
      "The letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Sir Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created The Matrix, which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.",
      "Many in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.",
      "Outside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.",
      "\"Using actual actors is the key to a lot of the drama and enjoyment that people get from video games,\" actor DW McCann said. \"People have lived experiences that AI just can't understand.\"",
      "The actors want a contract that guarantees their voices and likeness will not be used without their consent to train AI models that replace them in the future.",
      "Mooser says AI will allow filmmakers to create amazing art \u2013 if it's done right.  With humans calling the shots, he says, AI could help them create sets and worlds they couldn't easily access or invent \u2013 and to do so much faster than what they could traditionally do with computer graphics and visual effects.",
      "\"We're trying to say, look, technology is going to be in everything. Let's make sure that we try to fight as hard as we can to make sure that it's done in the right way, and that artists aren't run over by big companies.\"",

      "That changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.",
      "Stranger Things finale filming was 'incredibly emotional'",
      "The attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.",

The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).",
      "There are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity.

    "summary": "The opening night of the star's tour mixes flashes of brilliance with moments that fail to connect.",
    "story": [
      "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.",
      "The US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.",
      "But the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.",
      "The momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.",
      "Titled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".",
      "It comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.",
      "With 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).",
      "At its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.",
      "We see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.",
      "He arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.",
      "Clad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.",
      "The choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.",
      "At the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.",
      "He might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.",
      "The band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.",
      "The hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.",
      "The problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.",
      "The result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.",
      "Priapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.",
      "That sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality.",

    "story": [
      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "summary": "The Liverpool anthem Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is 20 years old this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ian Prowse was standing in his local pub literally crying into his beer about the end of a relationship when someone came in to tell him one of his songs had just been played on Radio 1.",
      "Told it was \"a song about a train\", Prowse, the former frontman of 1990s band Pele, was perplexed. At the time he had no record deal and the song he knew it must have been, Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? had not been released.",
      "He would then find out that BBC DJ John Peel had got hold of a copy, and had told his listeners that the song \u2013 a poignant love letter to Liverpool, warts and all \u2013 had moved him to tears.",
      "Twenty years on from its release, it has been covered by Irish folk star Christy Moore, championed by Elvis Costello, and has become an anthem for the city - not least for its raw reflections on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, whose 36th anniversary will be commemorated this month.",
      "Prowse, now 61, had been the frontman of the 1990s band Pele, and was playing with his new outfit Amsterdam when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? came to him as he sat at home one afternoon.",
      "The inspiration came from the story of William McKenzie, a Victorian merchant who rests in a pyramid-shaped tomb in the graveyard of St Andrew's church in Liverpool, supposedly buried sitting upright clutching a winning hand of cards.",
      "From that germ of inspiration, which gave the song its opening lines, the rest of the verses quickly flowed.",
      "\"I was on the floor at this point,\" he says. \"The music industry had changed with the likes of the X Factor, and if you were over 30 you were essentially dead in the water.",
      "\"I was really struggling, and then John Peel started playing the song and then suddenly we had a record deal again.\"",
      "The song was to receive an even bigger break when Irish folk star Moore came across it after a gig in Manchester, when a CD containing it was posted through the open window of his car by a fan as he left the Bridgewater Hall.",
      "\"By the time we got to London, I was in love with the song,\" says Moore.",
      "\"One of the great privileges of my life has been that I get to sing the songs of people like Ian Prowse.\"",
      "For Elvis Costello, some of the song's charm lies in Prowse's \"acute sense of the history of the city\".",
      "There are references in Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? to the Atlantic slave trade, of which Liverpool was the home; the influx of Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s and 1850s, and the events of 15 April 1989, reflected in the lyrics \"Yorkshire policemen fold their arms while people try and save their fellow fans\".",
      "Prowse adds: \"For people of my generation. Hillsborough was the central event. I had so many friends who were survivors, I could not write a song that's talking about Liverpool without including that.",
      "\"For the city it was a double tragedy: there was the horror of 97 people losing their lives, then there was the city being smeared in the media.",
      "\"There's still righteous fury about that in the city, and although the truth has come out, there's never been any justice really.\"",
      "Journalist Paul Du Noyer, who has written extensively about Liverpool and the Beatles, says of the song that it manages to encompass \"the very worst things in human history to the sheer fun of being out in Mathew Street\".",
      "He adds it \"ranked as one of the great Liverpool songs in that it was explicitly about Liverpool in the way that \u2013 to put it in distinguished company \u2013 Strawberry Fields Forever was, and Penny Lane\".",
      "For Prowse, who on 12 April will be performing the song at The Arts Club in Liverpool with the full seven-piece Amsterdam band to mark the 20th anniversary of its release, it is always humbling to see how well the song is received both on Merseyside and further afield.",
      "\"It's great to see how it travels so well,\" he says. \"It's always people's favourite song of mine whether I'm playing in Dublin or Glasgow, but also if I'm doing acoustic shows in Stroud or Perth or wherever.\"",
      "But there is no doubt that the most full-throated appreciation comes when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is played to a home crowd that knows the city and feels about it the way Prowse himself does.",
      "\"For all the darkness, and the bad things that have happened, it's still my favourite place in the whole world and it's somewhere I'd rather be than anywhere else,\" he says.",
      "\"The spirit, the heart of the place is amazing, and not necessarily despite of the bad things that have happened, but in some ways because of them.\"",

      "George Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.",
      "His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".",
      "He admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics.",
      "At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.",
      "Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.",
      "On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.",
      "Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.",
      "He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".",
      "But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.",
      "\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"",
      "The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.",
      "It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.",
      "There was a huge reaction from female fans.",
      "Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.",
      "The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.",
      "Fans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems.",
      "And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.",
      "He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.",
      "Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.",
      "In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.",
      "Audiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.",
      "He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.",
      "The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'",
      "In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.",
      "And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.",
      "This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.",
      "But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.",
      "The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.",
      "Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.",
      "He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.",

      "The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.",
      "Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.",

      "In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.",

      "These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.",
      "In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.",
      "Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.",
      "\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"",
      "Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.",
      "In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.",
      "He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.",

      "\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"",
      "He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.",
      "Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.",
      "For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience."

      "Bea Taylor, from the Nuffield Trust think-tank, which has published the findings along with the King's Fund, said: \"Just five years after the British public were called on to 'Protect the NHS' at the start of the pandemic, these findings reveal just how dismayed they are about the state of the NHS.",
      "\"The government says the NHS is broken - and the public agree. But support for the core principles of the NHS \u2013 free at the point of use, available to all and funded by taxation \u2013 endures despite the collapse in satisfaction.\"",
      "Louise Ansari, of the patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said the survey was a \"sobering reminder\" of the state of the NHS.",
      "\"Although many people tell us that they are grateful for the hard work of NHS staff, long waiting times and access issues across the health system have taken their toll on people's confidence in getting timely care in the first place.\"",

    "summary": "Exclusive data shows how neglect of this common mental health condition costs the UK nearly \u00a310bn a year.",
    "story": [
      "Failing to properly diagnose and treat people with bipolar disorder is wasting billions of pounds a year in the UK, according to new data shared exclusively with the BBC. Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are \"ghosts in the system\", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.",
      "Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.",
      "When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a \"deep low\". \"I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on,\" she says. \"They said my symptoms weren't that serious.\"",
      "When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.",
      "A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.",
      "It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.",
      "\"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%,\" she says.",
      "It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.",
      "Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are \"undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them\".",
      "The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which may make their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.",
      "Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated \u00a39.6bn a year. That equates to more than \u00a3300 per taxpayer.",
      "This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care.",
      "But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.",
      "'Common, complex and costly'",
      "\"This nearly \u00a310bn figure is actually quite conservative,\" says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.",
      "\"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial.\"",
      "The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work, with some claiming benefits in the UK.",
      "For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.",
      "Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: \"If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money.\"",
      "According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.",
      "Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCPsych and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is \"completely treatable\" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.",
      "\"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK.\"",
      "She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut \"the cost to society\" as well as reducing \"the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes\".",
      "It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.",
      "Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: \"Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.",
      "\"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly.\"",
      "This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.",
      "\"I was utterly delusional,\" she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.",
      "Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.",
      "She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.",
      "Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.",
      "\"I was failed,\" she says. \"I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs \u2013 energetic, grandiose language, erratic \u2013 but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned.\"",
      "Costs could be halved",
      "The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.",
      "Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.",
      "They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.",
      "Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health.\"",
      "However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.",
      "Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with \"less florid manic episodes\" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.",
      "\"There's a high threshold of referral,\" Prof Chew Graham says. \"People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services\". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.",
      "\"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck\".",
      "Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.",
      "\"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.",
      "\"It's a tragedy.\"",
      "An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions.",
      "\"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.",
      "\"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand \u2013 this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care says it has already announced \u00a326 million to open new mental health crisis centres and it will recruit 8,500 mental health workers to cut waiting times and provide faster treatment.",

      "A total of 180 people have visited the unit and more than 1,200 injections of street-bought heroin and cocaine have been supervised.",
      "A total of 27 people have been referred to other services, including housing, by staff.",
      "The service, which follows similar programmes in 18 other countries, seeks to reduce drug-related harm in a hardcore population of injecting users in one of the most deprived communities in Glasgow.",

      "He says the facility is \"brilliant\".",

      "She took Disclosure on a tour of Calton's known using spots and said there was evidence of freshly discarded needles.",
      "Linda also expressed anger at a lack of investment in the area.",
      "\"When we were going to the meetings at first, the drug workers were: 'We are providing a facility for your community, this will make your community better'.",

      "\"It will also improve the social environment for communities, residents, businesses and visitors to these areas,\" he said.",
      "\"The Thistle will hopefully reduce the drug-related death rates for the population that it serves. But that is a relatively small population compared with Scotland as a whole.",
      "\"Its contribution to the national drug death figures won't be very significant. We have to be honest about that.\"",
      "Dr Priyadarshi said much of the anger emanating from the community related to a lack of resources for other services in the area.",

    "story": [
      "Braids are one of the most popular hairstyles for black women, worn by celebrities and aunties alike - but questions are being raised about its effects on our health.",
      "The process can last up to five hours as stylists deftly part small, evenly-spaced sections of hair, and gradually add in extensions.",
      "Despite the long salon visits, braids have always been closely linked to convenience for me.",
      "Growing up, they were for holidays, as the style meant that instead of fretting over how frizzy my hair would get, I could jump in the pool with no worries.",
      "Braids are still what I turn to now when I want a few months break from all the detangling - or I want to try a new colour without the potential damage of hair dye.",
      "But a new study suggests that the synthetic hair many black women use to achieve this style could be bad for their health.",
      "The US non-profit organisation Consumer Reports tested samples from ten of the most popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, and found that all of them contained carcinogens, and in some cases, lead.",
      "The research made an impact, as my Instagram feed and WhatsApp groups were flooded with links to the study, warning of the alleged risks hidden in our hair.",
      "One of the messages was from my cousin, Rochelle, who does her braids herself every other month.",
      "\"Braids, famously, are called a protective style,\" she later told me.",
      "It's a term typically used to describe several Afro hairstyles, including braids, locs and wigs, that reduce how much your hair is exposed to the elements and cut back on constant styling.",
      "\"The fact that this style is doing everything but protect us - it's actually harming us - is actually quite wild to me.\"",
      "It is the lack of awareness among black women that is most concerning, she adds.",
      "\"People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they're doing could harm their body, whereas if you're putting braids in your hair, you're not thinking that it's harming you.\"",
      "James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have \"constant contact\" with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time.",
      "\"We believe that whenever you're exposed to harmful chemicals, that it's cumulative - it all adds up.\"",
      "But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: \"We're hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information.\"",
      "Here at Jos\u00e9e's Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn't putting clients off.",
      "Jos\u00e9e and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024.",
      "\"People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,\" Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were.",
      "Jos\u00e9e says that while the findings are \"worrying\", it has been business as usual at the salon.",
      "Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research.",
      "It's Kellie-Ann's first time getting her braids done at Jos\u00e9e's salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child.",
      "She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: \"I think it's awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better.\"",
      "She's now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same.",
      "\"A lot of women I've spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it's good for the planet as well.\"",
      "Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she's busy studying at university.",
      "She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco.",
      "\"Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it's not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for.\"",
      "She's concerned that the social media posts she has seen will \"scare people out of wanting to engage\", to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry.",
      "In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent \u00a3168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L'Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women.",
      "\"I'd like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,\" Ifeanyi says.",
      "For some, changing attitudes towards synthetic hair are opening up business opportunities.",
      "Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre.",
      "She tells me they have seen a \"huge uptick in demand\", especially in the US, where the study was published.",
      "But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research.",
      "\"We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, 'Oh, but salons are closed', but we were selling out because people don't stop doing their hair.\"",
      "She tells me that black women \"got to experiment\" more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products.",
      "One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years.",
      "But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka's most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2.5 times more than several high street brands.",
      "Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: \"To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you're essentially doubling the price.\"",
      "Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between \"fast food and healthy food\".",
      "She adds: \"You can actually reuse our products if you'd like, and therefore you're saving money in that way.\"",
      "Back at Jos\u00e9e's salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together.",
      "\"I call myself a braid baby because I've been braiding since I was 6 years old,\" she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on.",
      "\"It's an empowering service to offer,\" she adds, saying that it's gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted.",
      "Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation.",

      "Between 2020 and 2022, the DCMS gave \u00a3474m to bodies in the sport and culture sectors to help them to survive lockdown, \u00a3218m was to sporting bodies with \u00a3124m supporting Premiership rugby union clubs.",

      "The PAC warned of a \"gap in accountability to parliament\" over the money lent to rugby union, due to \"a conflict of interest\" involving a senior civil servant's connections with the sport.",

      "Premiership rugby union clubs accounted for 57% (\u00a3124m) of the DCMS's total loans of \u00a3218m to sports bodies during the pandemic. Rugby league (\u00a324.2m), horse racing (\u00a321.5m) and tennis (\u00a314.3m) were the next highest beneficiaries, while non-league football clubs received \u00a313.4m.",
      "But with then-Premiership clubs London Irish, Wasps and Worcester all going out of business during the 2022-23 campaign, the taxpayer has been left out of pocket by tens of millions of pounds in unrecovered loans.",
      "\"DCMS insisted that these clubs were financially viable when it awarded the loans, despite public reports at the time to the contrary,\" said the PAC.",
      "Noting that some borrowers had been granted \"repayment holidays\" of up to four years, the PAC said that loans \"should not be extended to provide support for bodies which are financially unviable five years post-pandemic\".",
      "The report recommends that the DCMS \"should demonstrate a tough approach on behalf of taxpayers to managing those borrowers in trouble, including when considering any future additional financial support\".",
      "'Concerning and avoidable'",
      "Last month, government officials defended the loans to professional rugby union clubs.",
      "But with both Newcastle and Exeter both recently seeking investment, they also admitted being increasingly pessimistic over the financial stability of the club game.",
      "The last set of accounts filed by all Premiership clubs in 2022-23 showed that the sides collectively lost \u00a330.5m and have net debts of more than \u00a3300m, amid fears that the finances of elite club are unsustainable.",
      "The most senior DSMS civil servant - permanent secretary Susannah Storey - told the PAC that her department would use \"all financial levers\" to recover the money owed to it.",
      "However in its report, the PAC says that Storey has \"a conflict of interest regarding rugby union\", because her husband Pev Hooper is on the board of Premiership Rugby, and is also a director at CVC Capital Partners - a major investor in the sport.",
      "\"She has properly declared this conflict and recused herself from relevant discussions and decisions, and the department has put in place arrangements involving other staff to handle the conflict\", says the PAC.",
      "\"However, the department is most heavily exposed to rugby union in terms of both the amount of loans it has made and the financial health of the sport. The conflict of interest meant that we could not question the Permanent Secretary directly about the \u00a3124m that the department had loaned to top-tier rugby union clubs and its subsequent management of these loans.\"",
      "It adds that \"this gap in senior oversight and accountability for such a significant amount of public money is concerning and avoidable. It strikes this committee as odd that the department has not taken steps to address this such as by asking another Permanent Secretary to provide scrutiny and assurance\".",
      "The PAC published correspondence it had received from Storey in which she said that \"it is not accurate to state that there is a gap in accountability\" because relevant decision-making had been delegated to colleagues in line with guidelines.",
      "She also said that it was wrong to say the DCMS was \"overly optimistic\" about recouping all the funding because it had made clear that as it expected 14% of borrowers to fail over a 10-year period.",
      "'Inconsistent approach'",
      "The PAC also said the DCMS has shown \"an inconsistent approach to its engagement with professional sports.\"",

    "summary": "Government sources have indicated that the agreement will not need further approval from the US.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is working with Mauritius to finalise a deal on the future of the Chagos Islands, Downing Street has said.",
      "Under the proposed agreement, Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a military base on one of the islands for an initial period of 99 years, at a cost to the British taxpayer.",
      "UK government sources have indicated they are not waiting for further sign-off from Donald Trump.",
      "Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the deal would not go ahead if the US president had objections.",
      "In a statement, the Mauritian government reiterated Downing Street's comments, saying that both countries were \"currently working to finalise this agreement\".",
      "The plan to hand over control of the Chagos Islands, officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory, was announced last October following negotiations with then-Mauritian leader Pravind Jugnauth.",
      "However, following elections, he was replaced by current PM Navin Ramgoolam, who expressed concerns about the deal.",
      "Progress on reaching agreement was also delayed after the election of Trump because negotiators wanted to give the new US administration time to examine the details of the plan.",
      "Giving away Chagos Islands not in UK's interest, says Badenoch",

      "Reform UK leader - and Trump ally - Nigel Farage had suggested that the proposal would be met with \"outright hostility\" by the new US president's team.",
      "In October, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the deal posed a \"serious threat\" to US national security, citing Mauritius' relationship with China.",
      "However, last month Trump indicated he would back the deal.",
      "Asked about it at a press conference with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in the Oval Office last month, he said: \"We're going to have some discussions about that very soon, and I have a feeling it's going to work out very well.",
      "\"They're talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years actually.",
      "\"That's a long time, and I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country.\"",
      "The Chagos plan is expected to enable the UK to lease Diego Garcia for 99 years. Ramgoolam has previously said the deal included a clause allowing for a further 40 year-extension.",
      "The Conservatives have fiercely criticised the deal, with party leader Kemi Badenoch arguing it was \"not in our national interest to give [them] away and pay for the privilege of doing so\".",
      "There have been reports that deal could cost the UK government up to \u00a318bn, a figure the Foreign Office has labelled \"inaccurate and misleading\".",
      "The government has not yet said how much the deal would cost but Sir Keir has promised to inform MPs of the details once the agreement is finalised.",
      "He defended the deal, calling it \"extremely important for our security\".",
      "The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony.",
      "Britain purchased the islands for \u00a33m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give away the Chagos Islands as part of a deal to get independence from Britain.",
      "In the late 1960s Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia and removed thousands of people from their homes on the island.",
      "In recent years, the UK has come under growing international pressure to return the islands to Mauritius, with both the United Nations' top court and general assembly siding with Mauritius over sovereignty claims.",
      "In late 2022, the previous Conservative government began negotiations over control of the territory but did not reach an agreement by the time it lost power in the 2024 general election.",

    "story": [
      "Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said she will review the role of the Sentencing Council following a \"two-tier\" justice row over its latest guidelines.",
      "Labour and the Conservatives have criticised the council's plan to advise judges in England and Wales to seek extra information before deciding how to punish offenders from certain minority groups.",
      "The guidelines have now been abandoned after ministers tabled an emergency law to override them on Tuesday.",
      "But Mahmood also told MPs she would launch a review of the \"proper role\" of the council and how it makes guidelines, to begin in the coming months.",
      "Sentencing guidelines ditched after 'two-tier' row",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Labour has shown a willingness in recent weeks to look afresh at the role of arm's length bodies, announcing plans last month to completely abolish one body, NHS England, and return its powers to the health department.",
      "There is already a review of the sentencing system under way, led by former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke and aimed tackling prison overcrowding.",
      "It is not currently clear how the two reviews will interact.",
      "The guidelines were set to advise magistrates and judges to obtain a pre-sentence report - giving further details of an offender's background - before handing out punishment to someone of an ethnic or faith minority, alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women.",
      "Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick first raised concerns about the guidelines earlier this month, saying they were biased \"against straight white men\" and amounted to \"two-tier justice\".",
      "In response, Mahmood said she also opposed a \"two-tier sentencing approach\" and that she \"did not stand for any differential treatment before the law\".",
      "The Sentencing Council had argued the now-suspended guidelines, which had been in development for months, would ensure courts had the \"most comprehensive information available\" to hand out an appropriate sentence.",
      "This, the council said, could address disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system.",
      "Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences.",
      "'Preferential treatment'",
      "Updating MPs on Tuesday, Mahmood said: \"The proper role of the Sentencing Council and the process for making guidelines of this type must be considered further.",
      "\"I will do so in the coming months. It is right that this question is considered in greater depth,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"should further legislation be required,\" she would propose it as part of the government's planned Sentencing Bill.",
      "\"The Sentencing Council, while only 15 years old, holds an important position within the firmament of our justice system and any changes must be made carefully and with due consideration,\" she told MPs.",
      "Parliament \"must reverse\" the guidelines and reassert \"that no race or religion should receive preferential treatment before the law,\" she said.",
      "Mahmood will also pilot the Sentencing Guidelines (Pre-sentence reports) Bill through Parliament after it was published on Tuesday.",
      "If passed, the bill would prevent future sentencing guidelines about pre-sentence reports \"framed by reference to different personal characteristics of an offender\".",
      "'Lost control'",
      "Responding to the new review, Jenrick said Labour had \"completely lost control of the justice system\".",
      "The new bill would not \"tackle the root cause of the problem,\" Jenrick argued.",
      "He described the Sentencing Council as an \"activist\" quango, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation, whose views were \"completely divergent to the public, to Parliament, and to the government.\"",
      "He called on the government to back his plan require ministerial approval of any future Sentencing Council guidelines.",
      "Veteran Labour MP Dianne Abbott said she was \"astonished\" that Mahmood thought judges could be swayed by \"guidelines in relation to how they sentence black and brown defendants\".",
      "\"Repeated statistical analysis has demonstrated what some of us consider to be unfairness in relation to black and brown people, and the criminal justice system,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "First Minister Eluned Morgan has criticised a UK cabinet minister and Welsh Labour colleague for saying she backed the chancellor's benefits cuts.",
      "Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told BBC Wales last week that the first minister had \"welcomed\" the reforms.",
      "In a fiery session in the Senedd dominated by rows over changes to disability and sickness payments, Morgan said: \"I had somebody else last week trying to speak for me. I speak for myself.\"",
      "Sources close to the first minister confirmed to the BBC that the comment referred to Stevens. The UK government has said it is not commenting on the matter.",
      "In her strongest comments on the issue so far, Morgan said she lamented the reforms and that people were \"suffering\" and \"worried\".",
      "But the first minister repeatedly declined to condemn the cuts outright as she came under sustained criticism from the opposition in first minister's questions (FMQs).",
      "She had written to Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall asking for an assessment of the cuts' impact on Wales on 11 March.",
      "On Tuesday the response was published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - with no impact assessment included, although the DWP promised to look \"at specific impacts for those living in Wales\" in future.",
      "The response had been received over a fortnight since Morgan's initial request. The Welsh government had declined to publish the letter itself.",
      "The issue is set to return to the Senedd again on Wednesday, after a Plaid Cymru proposal for a debate was agreed to by Welsh Labour and backed unanimously by the Senedd.",
      "At a committee meeting on Friday Morgan refused to support the welfare cuts until she knew what the impact would be in Wales.",
      "She responded with silence when Stevens' claim that she supported the changes was put to her.",
      "Welsh ministers refuse to release benefits cuts letter",
      "People 'terrified' by benefit reforms - Labour politician",
      "Reeves criticised by Labour MP on benefits cuts",
      "Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Darren Millar accused Morgan of a lack of transparency for not releasing the letter.",
      "In her Spring Statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of benefit changes, including tightening qualification rules for Personal Independence Payments (Pips) - the main disability benefit - claimed by more than 250,000 working aged people in Wales.",
      "In the Senedd Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth reminded the first minister of Stevens' comments, as he accused her of being fearful of upsetting the UK government.",
      "In response Morgan said: \"I've got a lot of people trying to put words into my mouth these days, haven't I?",
      "\"You summarized my position? I had somebody else last week trying to speak for me. I speak for myself. I speak for the Welsh government.",
      "\"The UK government can speak up for itself, and they can defend their positions. I will defend the position of the Welsh Labour government here in Wales.\"",
      "'Contempt'",
      "Morgan came under pressure from a number of Plaid Cymru MSs, who called for her to condemn the reforms.",
      "\"What contempt Westminster shows us, leaving us in Wales to second-guess the effect that these benefit cuts will have because Westminster refuses to tell us,\" said Delyth Jewell, Plaid MS for South Wales East.",
      "Morgan replied that she was \"exercised about the proposal\".",
      "She said: \"When we talk about changes, we have to understand that people are suffering here, and that we need to stand with them and listen to them and ensure that we speak for them.",
      "\"All over Wales today there are tens of thousands of people who are really worried about the impact that proposed reforms could have, but they don't know to what extent it will happen, they don't know when it will happen.",
      "\"I am determined to make sure that Welsh voices are heard when it comes to welfare reform,\" she added, promising to present concerns \"plainly and unambiguously in the evidence that we will present in response to welfare reform\".",
      "While she argued there were some things in the plans that were positive, Morgan said: \"One of the things that I lament is the fact that really, ideally, it should have been about putting people and the benefits system and the need to reform it first and then to worry about how that is organised afterwards.\"",
      "In her letter to Eluned Morgan, Kendall said: \"As the people of Wales know all too well, many of these challenges are concentrated in places which were decimated in the 80s and 90s when whole industries closed. 15% of working age people in Wales receive a disability or incapacity benefit \u2013 significantly higher than in England \u2013 and around a quarter are neither in work nor looking for work.\"",
      "She said the UK government was working with Welsh ministers on the design of \"a Get Britain Working Trailblazer\" to look at how work, health and skills support could be \"best joined up\".",
      "No impact assessment was included. However, a DWP spokesperson said it \"will work with the Welsh government and other devolved administrations to ensure their views are at the heart of what we do.",
      "\"This includes looking at specific impacts for those living in Wales to help support people back into work if they are able, while also protecting those who rely on our social security system.\"",
      "'Wave of new taxes'",
      "The Welsh Conservatives' Darren Millar said in a statement: \"The first minister promised accountability, but is delivering evasive answers and a complete lack of transparency.",
      "\"On a multitude of issues, Labour is hiding from scrutiny instead of giving the people of Wales the answers they deserve. On top of this, they're failing to stand up for Wales against Keir Starmer's wave of new taxes, hitting Welsh farmers and businesses.\"",
      "Rhun ap Iorwerth said in the Senedd: \"The first minister made opportunity for every family one of her top priorities. Now, the words are good, but on the deeds, she's falling well, well short.\"",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Welfare reform is getting messier for Labour.",
      "After some of the party's MPs and MSs spoke out against the plans, we now have the FM more explicitly taking issue with her Labour colleague at Westminster Jo Stevens.",
      "Morgan's response last week to the claim that she welcomed the reforms was a silent, stony stare.",
      "Some Labour MSs have been looking for the FM to assert herself on welfare, a tricky balance when the plans are being introduced by your own party.",
      "Although she declined another opportunity to condemn the cuts, the language \u2013 \"exercised\", \"lament\" \u2013 is carefully chosen to go about as far as she feels comfortable without actually condemning them.",
      "The problem for Morgan is that she is caught in a bind and risks pleasing no one.",
      "One of her own MSs has already warned that his constituents are \"terrified\". Opposition parties are on the attack.",
      "The Conservatives argue she is not being transparent enough about her dealings with the UK government; Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems say she is not fighting hard enough to stand up for Wales."

    "story": [
      "The UK is expecting to be hit by new US tariffs on Wednesday, with Downing Street indicating a deal to exempt British goods will not be reached in time.",
      "US President Donald Trump has said he plans to unveil a raft of new tariffs - or import taxes - on 2 April, on top of a 25% levy on car and car parts which has already been announced.",
      "Over the weekend he suggested the tariffs would hit all countries, not just those with the biggest trade imbalances with the US.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman said talks on an economic deal between the two countries to avoid tariffs had been \"constructive\" but he did not rule out retaliating if they were imposed on the UK.",
      "\"When it comes to tariffs, the prime minister has been clear he will always act in the national interest and we've been preparing for all eventualities ahead of the announcement from President Trump, which we would expect the UK to be impacted by alongside other countries,\" he said.",
      "\"We are having constructive discussions on a US-UK economic prosperity deal but we will only do a deal which delivers economic prosperity for the British people and we will only act in the national interest.\"",
      "Pressed on whether the government was hopeful of a deal to avert tariffs being reached by Wednesday, the spokesman said discussions between the UK and the US \"will likely continue beyond Wednesday\".",
      "He said the UK would \"take a calm and pragmatic approach\" in response to any tariffs, arguing \"a trade war with the US is not in anybody's interests\".",
      "But he added: \"We rule nothing out in response.\"",
      "UK prepared to retaliate against US tariffs, No 10 sources say",
      "Global shares slide as Trump tariffs loom",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Conservative shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith MP said: \"This news is potentially a hammer blow not just to British businesses and workers but to [the PM's] own chancellor whose creative accounting at the emergency budget fails to include the impact of tariffs.",
      "\"Labour claims talks with the US are going \"well\". But, if this is what well looks like, I wouldn't like to see what the opposite looks like. The prime minister has so far failed to come up with the goods, he needs to rekindle our US trade deal.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats have urged the government to hit back with its own tariffs, as Canada and the European Union have already done.",
      "The party's leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Just asking nicely clearly doesn't work with Trump, so we have to stand tall with our allies in Canada and Europe and show that we will not be bullied.",
      "\"That means being prepared to impose reciprocal tariffs if necessary, including on Elon Musk's Teslas, and urgently negotiating a better trade deal with the EU to show Trump we have alternatives.\"",
      "It comes after Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Trump over the phone on Sunday, with Downing Street saying the pair had \"productive negotiations\" about an economic deal.",
      "The government has argued the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US, compared to its other partners.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned a reciprocal trade war would wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate the headroom Chancellor Rachel Reeves has to stay within her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing.",
      "This could lead to further tax rises or spending cuts if she wanted to avoid breaking her fiscal rules.",
      "The OBR's latest economic forecast, published on Wednesday, said GDP would be 0.6% lower than forecast this year and 1% lower next year in the most \"severe\" scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to Trump's tariffs.",
      "In an alternative scenario where the UK does not retaliate, the OBR has forecast a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.",
      "It is unclear how the UK would retaliate if tariffs do come into effect. There are a range of options available, from duties on sectors where British products are particularly important to the US, to focusing on specific products like Harley Davidson motorcycles.",
      "UK car exports are worth about \u00a37.6bn per year, and the US is the second largest market for UK cars after the European Union, according to car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",

      "The US president argues his measures will help American manufacturers and protect jobs, despite warnings prices could go up for consumers.",
      "During a meeting between the prime minister and president at the White House last month, Trump hinted at \"a real trade deal\", which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs he has been threatening other countries with.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the UK?",
      "by Dharshini David, deputy economics editor",
      "The impact of a US tariff on all British goods is very uncertain. It depends on not just on the scale of any tariffs applied on British products, but how the government, businesses and consumers react.",
      "As the car industry knows already, tariffs are extremely worrying for the industries affected - as an exporter you hope that either some of it can be soaked up in the supply chain or your American customers will be happy to pay higher prices - or you take a hit to your own profits by lowering prices.",
      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",

    "story": [
      "Male fruit flies that drink alcohol become more attractive to females, according to a new study.",
      "Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.",
      "Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.",
      "Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.",
      "Previous research has studied different theories about this attraction, such as the flies were seeking a euphoric state or a substitute for the high of mating among males rejected by females.",
      "Study author Bill Hansson, head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute, said such research has taken an anthropomorphic view of fly behaviour, whereas this latest study suggests drinking alcohol gives the flies a reproductive advantage.",
      "\"We don't think flies drink alcohol because they are depressed,\" he said.",
      "The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.",
      "In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.",
      "Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.",
      "Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.",
      "The new study also showed that the fly's response to smelling alcohol is controlled by three different neural circuits in its brain.",
      "While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.",
      "Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.",
      "\"This means that the flies have a control mechanism that allows them to get all the benefits of alcohol consumption without risking alcohol intoxication,\" lead author Ian Keesey, of the University of Nebraska, said.",
      "For their investigations, the researchers combined physiological studies - such as imaging techniques to visualise processes in the fly brain, chemical analyses of environmental odours, and behavioural studies.",

    "story": [
      "The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.",
      "Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being \"cooked\" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.",
      "The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a \"lack of action\" over the issue of tyre exports.",
      "The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.",
      "The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.",
      "But BBC File on 4 Investigates revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are \"cooked\" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.",
      "Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.",
      "In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.",
      "A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways around. Villagers complained of persistent coughs and eye problems.",
      "Following the broadcast, the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC File on 4 Investigates that officials and lawyers within the EA were \"very keen\" to investigate the claims made in the programme, including any potential criminal activity.",
      "In a letter seen by the BBC, lawyers for the EA said that our investigation would be carefully considered as part of a review it has launched into its approach to waste tyre shipments.",
      "They added that the EA has been working to engage the relevant environmental authorities in India on this issue and is taking steps to arrange a delegation to meet with officials later this year.",
      "Fighting Dirty founder Georgia Elliott-Smith, who has been in correspondence with the EA over this issue since 2023, said it was a \"major victory\" for the group and that \"the government must stop turning a blind eye to the illegal and immoral activity\".",

      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.",

      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",

      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",

    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Mr Berjon.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

    "summary": "Yogita Limaye is the first foreign journalist to enter Myanmar since a huge earthquake hit the war-torn country.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing",
      "Driving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.",
      "In nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.",
      "Almost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.",
      "Myanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.",
      "What we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.",
      "\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days.",
      "Her 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha is a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.",
      "\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.",
      "When the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.",
      "Sai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.",
      "When we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.",
      "Even before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.",
      "This means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.",
      "The military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.",
      "And so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.",
      "Neeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.",
      "\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Working under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.",
      "The rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.",
      "Sitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.",
      "Myanmar earthquake: What we know",
      "Others gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.",
      "Agonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.",
      "But the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.",
      "Among the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.",
      "Many of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.",
      "Access to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.",
      "Close to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.",
      "\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.",
      "Their bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.",
      "Myanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.",
      "Parks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.",
      "Mandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.",
      "But tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.",
      "\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"",
      "She works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.",
      "\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.",
      "\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.",
      "Another elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"",
      "Most of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.",
      "Parts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.",
      "Shwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.",
      "There were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.",
      "Zar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.",
      "We couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.",
      "As the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.",
      "Nan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.",
      "\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\""

    "story": [
      "In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, there is a 72-hour \"golden window\" when those trapped under rubble are most likely to survive.",
      "But in the 72 hours after a 7.7 magnitude quake struck Myanmar on Friday, rescue and relief workers seeking access to some of the worst-hit areas were blocked by military authorities, multiple aid and human rights groups told the BBC.",
      "This was despite a rare plea for international humanitarian assistance by junta chief Min Aung Hlaing.",
      "\"I would like to invite any country, any organisation, or anyone in Myanmar to come and help,\" he said in a speech shortly after the disaster, claiming he had \"opened all ways for foreign aid\".",
      "On the ground, things moved less freely.",
      "\"I've talked to a few people now that were part of the rescue efforts in both Sagaing and Mandalay, and they said that [the military] imposed a curfew\u2026 the roads were blocked, the checkpoints were really long, and there was a huge checking of goods and services going in and a lot of questioning,\" John Quinley, director of international human rights group Fortify Rights, told the BBC.",
      "\"It could have just been a lot easier to allow those people in,\" he added. \"Obviously the Myanmar junta said it was for safety reasons, but I don't believe that's totally legitimate.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the golden window closed.",
      "At the time of writing, more than 2,886 people in Myanmar are confirmed dead as a result of the earthquake.",
      "On Tuesday night, an attack on an aid convoy further exacerbated concerns.",
      "At 21:21, a convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross Society vehicles carrying earthquake relief supplies was attacked by the military, according to Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), a resistance group in Shan State.",
      "The convoy was traveling toward Mandalay when it was fired upon by soldiers with machine guns, forcing it to turn back, the TNLA said in a Telegram post late on Tuesday.",
      "A junta spokesperson later confirmed that soldiers had shot at the vehicles, saying they had not been notified that the convoy would be passing through and fired warning shots after it failed to stop.",
      "But this is not the first time the junta has attacked aid workers, Mr Quinley said.",
      "\"They pick and choose when aid can go in, and if they can't monitor it and they can't use it how they want, they restrict it,\" he said. \"They definitely also, on top of that, actively target humanitarian workers.\"",
      "The junta, which began fighting a civil war with resistance forces in Myanmar after it seized control of the country in 2021, has a history of weaponising aid and humanitarian assistance: funnelling it towards areas that are under its control and restricting it in areas that are not.",
      "The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November last year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict.",
      "In previous natural disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Typhoon Yagi in 2024, which left hundreds dead, the military obstructed relief efforts in resistance-held areas by refusing to release supplies from customs, authorise travel for aid workers or relax restrictions on lifesaving assistance.",
      "\"It's a worrying trend that happens in times of crisis, like the earthquake,\" Mr Quinley said. \"The junta is blocking any aid to what they see as groups that are aligned with the broader resistance.\"",
      "James Rodehaver, head of the Myanmar team at the Office for the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, further suggested that the junta deprives Myanmar's population of aid as a form of punishment.",
      "\"They do that because the local population, by and large, does not support them, so by depriving them of humanitarian aid, they are both punishing them but also cutting off their ability to support themselves and be resilient,\" he told the BBC.",
      "There are already signs the junta may be repeating this tactic in Sagaing.",
      "Although central Myanmar, which includes the cities of Sagaing and Mandalay, is nominally run by the junta - meaning aid can only be delivered to the area with their co-operation - large parts of the broader Sagaing and Mandalay regions are considered resistance strongholds.",
      "The likelihood that the junta might tactically deprive these areas of aid has prompted outcry from hundreds of human rights and civil society organisations, who have urged the international community to ensure relief efforts get to where they're most needed, and aren't channelled through the military government.",
      "One such statement, signed by 265 civil society organisations and released on Sunday, notes that most of the worst-hit areas are under the effective control and administration of pro-democracy resistance groups.",
      "\"Myanmar's history provides stark warnings about the dangers of channelling aid through the military junta,\" it reads.",
      "In Sagaing, the impact of aid shortfalls can already be seen in troubling ways, according to relief agencies.",
      "They speak of shortages of food, water and fuel, while trucks carrying aid are stranded at military checkpoints around the city. Hundreds of residents, suddenly homeless, are sleeping outside on the street. Rescue volunteers who were forced to dig through the rubble with their bare hands have run out of body bags for those they couldn't save.",
      "Other community members seeking to respond to the earthquake are being forced to get authorisation from junta authorities by submitting lists of volunteers and items to be donated, local media reported.",
      "This tactic \u2013 of bombarding responders with lengthy bureaucratic checklists and processes \u2013 is routinely deployed by the junta to restrict the activities of international aid organisations in Myanmar, humanitarian sources told the BBC.",
      "According to a registration law imposed in 2023, such organisations must attain a registration certificate, and often sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant government ministries, to legally operate inside the country.",
      "One source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said aid groups are often required to remove certain activities, areas or townships from their proposals, with no room for negotiation. Areas where the junta doesn't have oversight or control over the aid work are typically those that are disallowed, they added.",
      "Aid agencies have found ways to navigate the junta's restriction, however: a lot of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar happens underground, via local groups that can bypass checkpoints and distribute aid without attracting the attention of the authorities.",
      "Many financial transactions in humanitarian aid also happen outside of Myanmar's banking system, so that actors can avoid scrutiny and potential investigation from the country's central bank, a source told the BBC. In some cases, humanitarian organisations open bank accounts in Thailand so that they can privately receive aid funds, then carry the money over the border into Myanmar in cash.",
      "Such covert methods take time, however, and could lead to potentially fatal delays of days or weeks.",
      "Some aid workers are hopeful that, given the scale of Friday's earthquake and the international appeal for assistance by Min Aung Hlaing, it may be easier to overcome barriers and provide aid more efficiently.",
      "\"In the past we have faced some challenges,\" said Louise Gorton, an emergency specialist based in Unicef's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office.",
      "\"The scale of this emergency, though, is significantly higher\u2026 I think there will be pressure on the regime to ensure unfettered and unimpeded humanitarian access - and we'll continue to repeat the same need and find ways, sometimes low-key ways, to deliver aid.\"",
      "Cara Bragg, country manager for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) team in Myanmar, said that while it's too early to tell whether the junta will truly \"open all ways for foreign aid\", her team is prepared to navigate the complex humanitarian situation to deliver assistance.",
      "\"It's certainly a concern that they [the military] may direct the aid in specific places, and not based on need,\" said Ms Bragg, who is based in Yangon.",
      "\"But as humanitarian actors CRS works under a humanitarian mandate, and will be very focused on getting aid to the places it needs to go - to the hardest-hit areas, regardless of who controls them.\"",
      "Early indications suggest that, despite Min Aung Hlaing's plea to the international community, the embattled junta leader is unlikely to prioritise the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "Shortly after the earthquake, military jets launched a series of airstrikes on affected areas, killing more than 50 civilians, according to the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC).",
      "Then, on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing rejected ceasefire proposals that were put forward by resistance groups in a bid to facilitate aid. Military operations would continue as \"necessary protective measures\", he said.",
      "The junta changed its mind a day later, agreeing to a 20-day ceasefire to help relief efforts. But it remains to be seen whether the pause in hostilities will hold. The military stressed it would \"respond accordingly\" if rebels launched attacks.",
      "For many onlookers, this seeming contradiction - of asking for aid with one hand while conducting military strikes with the other - chimes with Min Aung Hlaing's history of duplicity.",
      "John Quinley, from Fortify Rights, noted that the junta leader has \"lied on numerous occasions\" - and suggested that the recent appeal for foreign aid is more likely an appeal for international recognition.",
      "Against that backdrop, Mr Quinley added, it's critical to ensure earthquake relief gets to where it is most needed.",
      "\"I think as a human rights group we need to monitor: OK, [Min Aung Hlaing] allows aid in - but is it actually reaching people in need? Or is he weaponising the aid? Is he blocking the aid from getting to communities in need?\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not hopeful when it comes to taking what Min Aung Hlaing says with any hint of truth.\""

      "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "The airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.",
      "\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.",
      "But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.",
      "Le Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.",
      "\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",
      "As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.",
      "No clear frontrunner for president",
      "Nervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.",
      "But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.",
      "An early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust.",
      "Tellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.",
      "In other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.",
      "And remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.",
      "Emmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.",
      "Le Pen's crime and punishment",
      "Anyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.",
      "The evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.",
      "That the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.",
      "Regarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case.",
      "Had they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.",
      "\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.",
      "They berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".",
      "Hypocrisy among the elite",
      "It is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.",
      "That toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.",
      "Le Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.",
      "\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.",
      "Reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.",
      "At least not yet.",
      "Future of France's far right",
      "So where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?",
      "The short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.",
      "The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.",
      "One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.",
      "If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration.",
      "But turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.",
      "The Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.",
      "Meanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.",
      "But this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.",
      "\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.",
      "It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.",
      "To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?",
      "As for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?",
      "France has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.",
      "History may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.",

      "\"Roughly by 04:30, all Civil Defence vehicles were in place. At 04:40 the first two vehicles went out. At 04:50, the last vehicle arrived. At around 05:00, the agency [UN] car was shot at directly in the street,\" he says.",
      "The Israeli military says its forces opened fire because the vehicles were moving suspiciously towards soldiers without prior co-ordination and with their lights off. It also claimed that nine Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives were killed in the incident.",
      "Munther challenges that account.",
      "\"During day and at night, it's the same thing. External and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it's an ambulance vehicle that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All lights were on until the vehicle came under direct fire,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has permanently dismissed the criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, weeks after the Trump administration directed prosecutors to drop the corruption charges.",
      "The move led to the resignation of Manhattan's top federal prosecutor who accused Adams of striking a deal with the Trump administration to dismiss his case in exchange for immigration enforcement.",
      "The Manhattan judge dismissed the case \"with prejudice\", which means the Department of Justice (DOJ) cannot refile the charges against Adams based on the same evidence.",
      "Adams was charged with conspiracy, fraud, soliciting illegal campaign contributions, and bribery. He had denied any wrongdoing.",

      "\"Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,\" he said.",
      "His decision to drop the case permanently, Judge Ho said, ensured that the administration could not use the indictment as \"leverage\" over Adams or the city of New York.",
      "\"Dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Judge Ho noted that some people would \"undoubtedly\" find his ruling unsatisfying, wondering why \"if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the Motion to Dismiss altogether\".",
      "But, he repeated, the court cannot order the justice department to continue prosecuting if it has decided to drop the case.",

      "\"As long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do.\"",
      "Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz had announced earlier that the military would be expanding its offensive to clear and \"seize large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel\", without saying where they would be. He added that it would require a \"large-scale\" evacuation of Palestinians.",
      "Katz also urged Gazans to act to remove Hamas and free remaining Israeli hostages, without suggesting how they should do so.",

      "Israel has already significantly expanded a buffer zone around the edge of Gaza over the course of the war, and seized control of a corridor of land cutting through its centre, known as the Netzarim Corridor.",
      "Israel launched its renewed Gaza offensive on 18 March, blaming Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the ceasefire and free the remaining hostages. Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of violating the original deal they had agreed to in January.",

      "At least 50,423 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, including 1,066 over the past two weeks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "story": [
      "The murder of a young Sicilian woman by a stalker in broad daylight has sent shockwaves across Italy, where 11 women have been killed since the start of the year.",
      "University student Sara Campanella, 22, was killed by an acquaintance on Monday afternoon in the Sicilian city of Messina.",
      "Witnesses told media that they saw a man - later identified by prosecutors as 27-year-old Stefano Argentino - walk up to Ms Campanella and stab her on the street. She tried to get away and screamed \"Stop it, let me go, stop it,\" before collapsing, they said.",
      "A passer-by who reportedly heard Ms Campanella's screams tried to chase the attacker, who managed to flee.",
      "Ms Campanella died on her way to the hospital. Mr Argentino was arrested a few hours later in the nearby town of Noto.",
      "Raffaele Leone, Mr Argentino's lawyer, told Italian media on Wednesday that his client had admitted the charges against him, but had not explained why he had attacked her.",
      "\"I can't say if he's remorseful, he's quite closed up,\" Mr Leone was quoted by Ansa news agency as saying.",
      "The Messina prosecutor, Antonio D'Amato, said that Stefano Argentino had \"insistently and repeatedly\" harassed Sara Campanella since she started university two years ago. She was studying to become a biomedical technician.",
      "One of her friends once had to intervene when Mr Argentino kept complaining that Ms Campanella no longer smiled at him, Mr D'Amato said.",
      "But he added that Ms Campanella never went to the police as she did not feel that Mr Argentino's attentions were particularly \"threatening or pathological\".",
      "In the police detention order quoted by Italian media, prosecutors said that Mr Argentino had been \"regularly pestering the victim, asking her to go out with him and get to know each other better, and refusing to back down even when she would turn him down\".",
      "Mr D'Amato said that, shortly before being stabbed, Ms Campanella sent a message to some friends, telling them that \"that sick guy is following me\".",
      "Writing on Facebook, Ms Campanella's mother said that her daughter \"bravely thought her 'No' would be enough because [Stefano Argentino] meant nothing to her, they weren't together, she just wanted him to leave her alone, she wanted to live and dream and graduate.",
      "\"You always need to speak up and go to the police! Help me give Sara a voice,\" she said.",
      "In an emotional interview to Italian TV, Ms Campanella's brother said that unrequited love or attention could never be a reason for \"act like this one\".",
      "\"There are no justifications, and someone like him doesn't even deserve words.\"",
      "The father of Giulia Cecchettin, who was also 22 when she was killed by her ex-boyfriend, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica that there are \"entire generations of men who don't accept rejection\".",
      "\"Love is not possession, jealousy is not love, and saying 'No' is a right. In Sara's case there hadn't even been a relationship,\" Mr Cecchettin said.",
      "\"Women continue to be killed by those who don't accept their rejection. We need to make an extraordinary effort, a collective act of rebellion... against this culture of death,\" said Mara Carfagna, a former minister and lawmaker.",
      "The issue of violence against women is keenly felt in Italy, where femicides are frequently reported by the media. Last month alone, four women died at the hands of their partners or ex-partners.",
      "On Wednesday, less than 48 hours after her death, Sara Campanella's murder was pushed out of the headlines by news that the body of 22-year-old Ilaria Sula had been found in a suitcase in Rome.",
      "The university student had gone missing last week. According to Italian media, her ex-boyfriend has confessed to her murder."

      "Composed before El Chapo was jailed, it describes him as \"the world's most wanted man\" who is not only rich because he has \"many banknotes\" but also because he \"can count on the friendship of the people\", the song claims.",
      "The concert at which the band projected the image of El Mencho came just weeks after relatives searching for disappeared loved ones came across a ranch that has been described by the authorities as a \"training and extermination camp\" for the CJNG.",
      "Hundreds of abandoned shoes and suitcases, as well as bone fragments and ovens, found at the ranch seem to indicate that the cartel used it to train people it had recruited forcibly or by deception, killing those who resisted.",

      "Asked about the incident at her morning news conference, she said that \"this shouldn't happen, it's not right\" and ordered an investigation.",

    "summary": "The president is expected to unveil details of his plans for a wider set of import taxes. But what tariffs and when?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says tariffs are coming. That message from the US president has been consistent.",
      "But what tariffs and when? Import taxes have come so thick and fast since he took office that it can be hard to keep track.",
      "Trump has already raised duties on Chinese imports, as well as steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Higher levies on cars are due to go into effect this week.",
      "We're now waiting for Trump to unveil the details of his plan for a wider set of tariffs, which his team has spent the last few weeks developing.",
      "The White House is calling it \"Liberation Day\". So what might we learn on Wednesday?",
      "Live updates as Trump plans to announce sweeping tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Live updates as Trump plans to announce sweeping tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "How big are the tariffs?",
      "The White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.",
      "Once in office, he introduced the idea of \"reciprocal\" tariffs, suggesting the rates could vary country by country.",
      "\"Very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them,\" he said in February, shortly before he ordered officials to develop such a plan.",
      "The White House almost immediately complicated the picture, noting that their recommendations would reflect not just tariffs but also other policies they believe are unfair to US businesses, like Value Added Tax (VAT).",
      "It has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump.",
      "Officials in Europe, for example, are preparing for a double-digit tariff on their exports. Trump earlier this year said he planned to hit goods from the bloc with a 25% import tax.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The Trump administration has not confirmed which countries will be hit, although it has trailed Wednesday's announcement as a sweeping one.",
      "On Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to \"all countries\", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign.",
      "It dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal.",
      "But it is still unclear to what extent the tariffs will be universally applied or more targeted.",
      "Last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said efforts were focused on the \"Dirty 15\" - the 15% of countries that account for the bulk of trade with the US and impose tariffs or other rules that put US firms at a disadvantage.",
      "The Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was  \"particularly interested\".",
      "They were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and Vietnam.",
      "Trump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU.",
      "\"Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,\" he declared last week.",
      "What impact will the tariffs have?",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports. So the big question is, who will pay?",
      "Technically, there is a simple answer: the US firms bringing in the goods are the companies that will face the bill, especially if the White House starts levying the tariffs \"immediately\", as spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested on Tuesday.",
      "But the larger the tariffs are, the more firms will be looking for ways to offset those costs, either by changing suppliers, pushing business partners to share the burden - or by raising prices for Americans.",
      "Many firms have said they are already preparing for that step. But it is a risky game because if companies raise prices too much, buyers will simply stay away.",
      "The dynamics have raised the risks of an economic recession both in the US - and far outside its borders, where many firms rely on US sales.",
      "Trump says companies looking to avoid tariffs can simply do their business in the US, but that's not an immediate, or easy fix, given the high costs of hiring and setting up factories.",
      "Introduce currency swings and retaliation by other countries into the mix, and the repercussions of Trump's bid to reset global trade balances are likely to prove hard to predict long after Wednesday's announcement."

    "story": [
      "Standing in front of a few dozen supporters in a strip-mall parking lot in Ocala, Florida, on Monday evening, Democratic congressional candidate Josh Weil made a prediction.",
      "The public school maths teacher said that in less than 24 hours, he was going to make history by flipping a solidly Republican congressional seat \u2013 helping to wrest control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans.",
      "\"Their 2025 agenda stops here,\" he promised, railing against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to slash government services and personnel.",
      "Just an hour earlier, in a telephone town hall meeting, Randy Fine, his Republican opponent in Tuesday's special election, had a similar message \u2013 although he framed it as a warning, not a promise.",
      "\"Democrats are mad,\" he said. \"They're going to do whatever it takes to grind Donald Trump's agenda to a halt.\"",
      "Voters in the eastern half of central Florida, from Ocala to the towns north of Daytona Beach, head to the polls to fill the seat vacated by Michael Waltz, chosen by Trump to be national security advisor. Waltz recently sparked a media frenzy after inadvertently adding a prominent journalist to a high-level group chat about the US strikes in Yemen.",

      "Mike Waltz takes 'full responsibility' for Signal group chat leak",
      "Watch: How the Signal group chat fallout unfolded",
      "That Waltz's job may now be in jeopardy is just one reason Tuesday's contest for one of the 435 House seats is now a national story.",
      "The other is that Weil, despite running in a district Trump carried by more than 30 points last November, just might win. And if he does, Democrats would take a big step closer to a majority in the narrowly divided House.",
      "Win or lose, the race also could serve as a barometer of voters' motivation as Trump begins his second term \u2013 and offer hints at the political landscape ahead of next year's mid-term congressional elections.",
      "It is one of two special elections in Florida on Tuesday. The other, in Florida's panhandle region, will determine a replacement for Matt Gaetz, the firebrand congressman Trump originally picked to be attorney general before he withdrew  under a cloud of sexual misconduct and ethics allegations. A Republican is widely expected to win there.",
      "But that is not the case here. Weil has raised about $10m in campaign donations, dwarfing the $1m brought in by Fine, a Florida state senator.",
      "According to a recent public opinion survey, Weil narrowly trails Fine. An internal poll by a respected Republican firm reportedly showed Weil ahead by 3.",
      "That's enough to cause more than a little anxiety in Republican ranks.",
      "\"There's no excuse for a Republican not to win this race,\" said Randy Ross, a Florida-based conservative activist who campaigned there for Trump in 2016 and 2024. \"The only excuse that can possibly be had is Republicans weren't excited and didn't get out to vote.\"",
      "Mr Ross added that Republican voters need to understand that Fine will support Trump's agenda in Congress \u2013 and Weil will not.",
      "To this end, some of the party's heaviest hitters stepped in to help. Last Thursday, Trump joined the Republican candidate in two telephone town hall events. On Monday night, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro held their own event.",
      "\"Donald Trump's agenda is hanging by a thread,\" Shapiro said. \"This is a district that simply cannot fall into Democratic hands.\"",
      "Tech multi-billionaire Musk, a close Trump ally, may be campaigning in person for a hotly contested Wisconsin Supreme Court race, but his political committee directed more than $75,000 to support Fine in recent days. Other conservative groups followed suit, helping Fine level the financial playing field.",

      "Wisconsin attorney general sues to block Elon Musk $2m election giveaway",
      "Federal judge halts further shuttering of USAID",
      "Of particular concern for the party is that special elections take place during times of lower political engagement and usually involve only the one race in question. They often tilt toward the party with the most enthusiasm, according to Mr Ross. For Republicans, a Democratic show of strength on Tuesday would be troubling.",
      "\"You can't go just on name recognition in a special election,\" he said. \"You've got to drive people out to vote for you.\"",
      "Republican nervousness is a result of simple math in the House of Representatives. With a 218 to 213 majority in the 435 seat chamber, the party cannot afford to lose any winnable elections \u2013 let alone ones that should be a slam dunk.",
      "While a Weil victory alone wouldn't be enough to flip control of the chamber, two of the currently vacant seats are in safely Democratic districts. If the results of those special elections go as expected, Democrats would be on the verge of control.",
      "That could explain why the president announced on Friday he was withdrawing his pick of New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be US ambassador to the United Nations, despite her having all but formally vacated her office. A Weil victory on Tuesday would mean the Republicans could not afford to lose a New York election to replace Stefanik.",
      "Even before Tuesday's balloting, both Democrats and Republicans jockeyed to frame the results in the best light for their party.",
      "Conservatives downplayed the national implications of the race and placed blame on Fine, who has been accused of running a lacklustre campaign and taking victory for granted.",
      "\"It's a reflection of the candidate that's running the race, \" Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said of Fine's apparent underperformance.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are declaring a victory \u2013 at least, the moral variety.",
      "\"These are races that should not, under ordinary circumstances, be on anyone's political radar,\" Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said last Monday. \"The American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling.\"",
      "That sentiment was echoed by many of Weil's supporters on Monday night in Ocala, even if the candidate himself told the BBC he would win by eight points.",
      "\"If we lose but come close, moderate Republicans might take notice,\" said Buddy Oswald, an attorney and educator. If they were worried their party could lose a safe seat, he added, maybe they would feel the heat and be more willing to break with the president.",
      "Eight years ago, in the aftermath of Trump's stunning 2016 presidential victory, Democrats sought solace in special election races across the map. They pulled off some stunners, including a Doug Jones Senate victory in deeply conservative Alabama. In other races, such as a bid by Jon Ossoff in a suburban Atlanta district, the Democrat came up just short.",
      "Those races presaged a high level of Democratic enthusiasm that led to a wave in the mid-terms the following year, when the party won 39 seats in taking back the House of Representatives and putting a decisive end to Trump's first-term legislative agenda.",
      "Republicans, with convincing victories on Tuesday, want to squelch any chance of history repeating itself.",
      "Democrats, engaged in a sometimes acrimonious debate over strategy and political priorities, would like Florida to get them back in the win column \u2013 or at least give them hope of better days to come.",

    "story": [
      "Twenty-three more women have come forward to the police with allegations against serial rapist Zhenhao Zou - a Chinese PhD student found guilty in London last month of drugging and raping 10 women across two continents.",
      "Police said at the conclusion of his trial they had video evidence, filmed by Zou himself, of potentially 50 more victims - and they have been trying to trace these women. Detectives now say, however, that they believe Zou's \"offending group is far greater\".",
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence",
      "Two women who have contacted police in the past month with new allegations have also spoken to the BBC World Service. One said Zou raped her in his hometown in China, after spiking her drink which left her conscious but unable to speak or move. The other said Zou drugged her too - in London - and that she had woken up to find him filming himself sexually assaulting her.",
      "We have also spoken to two women whose testimony helped convict Zou - who will be sentenced in June. \"If I had spoken up earlier, maybe there wouldn't have been so many victims after me,\" one of them told us.",
      "She and the other women say they struggle with the guilt of now knowing that Zou has assaulted so many women.",
      "Two bottles on the table",
      "One of the women making new allegations, who we are calling Alice, told the BBC that Zou had assaulted her in London in 2021, but that she had only felt able to go to police after his trial last month. \"I didn't know that was something you could report,\" the Chinese national told us.",
      "She says she first met Zou while out clubbing in London with other Chinese-student friends. The group had all added one another on WeChat, a popular social messaging app.",
      "Not long afterwards, a mutual friend invited Alice to have drinks at Zou's upmarket student accommodation in Bloomsbury.",
      "There were two bottles of spirits on the table, she says, both already opened and half-empty. She began to share drinks from one of the bottles with her friend - but says Zou only drank from the other one.",
      "Alice says her friend normally tolerated alcohol well, but this time became drunk very quickly and appeared to fall asleep on the floor. The alcohol kicked in suddenly for Alice too, she says.",
      "\"Normally when you drink too much, you feel good for a while. But that night I just felt extremely dizzy and sleepy right away.\"",
      "Zou persuaded her it wouldn't be safe to take a taxi home in the state she was in, she told us, and asked her to take a nap in his bedroom. She says she agreed, knowing her friend was also still in the apartment.",
      "The next thing she says she remembers is waking up to Zou removing her trousers.",
      "\"I stopped him right away,\" she says - explaining how she then noticed a torchlight from a mobile phone above her head, and realised, to her horror, that he was filming her.",
      "Alice describes trying to leave his bedroom but being aggressively \"yanked back from the doorway\". Zou used such strong force to try to keep her in the bedroom, she says, that she \"had to cling on to the door frame with both hands\".",
      "It was only when she threatened to scream for help, that he let go - she told us - with Zou then telling her not to make \"a big deal\" of things, or to go to the police.",
      "Zou contacted Alice the next day on WeChat, she says, but he made no mention of the previous night. He asked her to dinner but she says she ignored him and they were never in touch again.",
      "Alice confided in a few close friends, but took things no further.",
      "\"I thought that, first, you needed evidence. And second, something substantial had to have happened before you could call the police.\"",
      "Alice says the next time she saw Zou's face was nearly four years later in the media - after he was charged by police.",
      "It is challenging for foreign nationals to report sexual crimes in the UK, says Sarah Yeh, a trustee at Southeast and East Asian Women's Association in London.",
      "\"It would be daunting for anyone [from] overseas to be traumatised by rape and then have to navigate the British legal system and the NHS, or even access the services provided for victims,\" she told us.",
      "They might not understand their rights or what resources are available to them - she says - as well as being concerned about repercussions, negative impacts on their studies, shame brought on themselves and their families, and potential legal challenges.",
      "About a year after Alice says she was assaulted, she discovered that one of her male friends in London also knew Zou, but had cut all contact because he found out Zou had been spiking women's drinks.",
      "The friend - who the BBC is calling Jie - told us he \"wasn't surprised at all\" when he heard Zou had been convicted.",
      "\"A lot of friends at the time probably knew [what Zou was doing]. I reckon some of our female friends knew too.\"",
      "Jie told us he accidentally drank from someone else's glass at a party in 2022, and then became \"unwell\" and \"very sleepy\". Zou then told him he had spiked the drink - says Jie - and had meant for a woman at the party to drink it.",
      "Jie says Zou later showed him a small bag of drugs and asked if he wanted to \"collaborate with him\". He says he took from this that Zou wanted his help finding girls whose drinks he could spike. Jie says he refused.",
      "The BBC asked Jie why he had initially continued to see Zou and why he didn't go to the police. Jie told us they both had lots of mutual friends so it was difficult not to socialise together. He says he did warn his friends about Zou, telling them not to hang out with him \"because he was drugging people\".",
      "Jie doesn't like thinking about those memories, he says, and that is why he hasn't gone to the police - adding that he had believed the women's testimonies were enough to convict Zou.",
      "Eventually, Jie says, he did cut all ties with him.",
      "Another young woman who has been in touch with police in London and China since Zou's trial is \"Rachel\". She says she was drugged and raped by him in 2022 in his hometown of Dongguan - in Guangdong province.",
      "Rachel told the BBC she had gone on a date with Zou, having met him online. She thought they were going to a bar, she says, but ended up at his home - a large villa which Zou had described as one of his family's many properties.",
      "With his back turned to her, she says Zou mixed her a green-coloured cocktail. They then started a drinking game, she says, and she experienced a \"wave of dizziness\". Rachel has told UK police that Zou took her up to a bedroom, where she became unable to speak or move her body, and then raped her.",
      "She thought about calling the police the next day, but decided against it. She feared it would be very difficult to prove non-consent. \"It's hard for me to prove the fact that I was willing to go to his place for drinks and that was not a signal that I was consenting to sex,\" she told us.",
      "She added that Dongguan is a small place and there was always a risk that people she knew - her parents, relatives and colleagues - would find out and think she was \"indiscreet\".",
      "Details of help and support with sexual violence are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of help and support with sexual violence are available at BBC Action Line",
      "We have seen Rachel's statement to UK police. She wants her story to be heard now, she says, to encourage more victims to come forward - and because she would like to see Zou prosecuted in China as well as the UK.",
      "Cdr Kevin Southworth - who leads public protection at the Metropolitan Police - told the BBC officers were still working their way through the 23 potential new cases and that some of the people were \"definitely not identical\" to those featured in Zou's seized secret footage or from the charge cases so far.",
      "\"It speaks to the fact that his offending group is actually far greater than we had realised,\" he says.",
      "A second trial for the convicted rapist has not been ruled out and there is \"certainly a case\" to discuss with the Crown Prosecution Service, given the numbers of women coming forward, he adds.",
      "'He wears a Rolex submariner watch'",
      "The BBC has also spoken to the only two victims who police were able to identify ahead of Zou's trial - both are Chinese nationals who had been studying in London. The women got to know each other on social media after one of them, who we are calling Beth, posted about her experience.",
      "Beth was raped by Zou in 2023 and had tried to report the crime to the Metropolitan Police soon afterwards. But then she decided not to pursue things because she felt unsure of UK law and had been left feeling discouraged after her initial interaction with the police, which included a poor translation of her 999 call.",
      "\"Back then I didn't know [Zou's name]. I didn't know his address, I could only give general information,\" she says.",
      "In frustration, Beth posted a warning on social media about what had happened to her. Another Chinese student, \"Clara\", says she \"immediately\" knew this was the same man who had drugged and raped her after a night out in London's Chinatown, two years before.",
      "Every detail in Beth's post pointed to the same man, says Clara: \"He has a Guangdong accent, he looks honest and he wears a Rolex submariner watch.\"",
      "The women began to speak online and Beth encouraged Clara to report what had happened to her to the police.",
      "Months later, police contacted Beth to say they were re-investigating the case. Clara had come forward.",
      "On Zou's seized devices, police had also found a video featuring Beth.",
      "The Met has since expressed regret over how it initially handled her allegations.",
      "\"We want to avoid situations where victims feel like they're maybe not being taken seriously, or heaven forbid, being disbelieved,\" says Cdr Southworth. Additional training is now being rolled out to all front line officers, he says.",
      "Clara describes a positive experience with British police. She says she didn't want to fly to London for the trial, in case her parents found out, so the Met sent two officers to China to support her as she gave evidence by video instead.",
      "The officers were assisted by the Chinese authorities, who have been working collaboratively with the Met and are \"very supportive\", says Cdr Southworth.",
      "\"I hope that can give some encouragement to victim-survivors, wherever they are in the world, that you are safe to come forward.\"",
      "In addition to his time in London, Zou also studied in Belfast between 2017 and 2019 - police do not know if his campaign of drug rape had already begun while he was there.",
      "Beth - who gave her evidence in court in London - says it was only afterwards that she realised that she and Clara were the only two women to have helped convict Zou.",
      "\"I thought for a long time that I wasn't an important part of the case against Zou,\" she says.",
      "Now she is glad she testified and is encouraging other women to come forward.",
      "If you have information about this story that you would like to share with us please get in touch.",

      "She left the court early \u2013 just before hearing that she was barred from running for office for five years after being found guilty of embezzlement of EU funds \u2013 almost certainly ruling her out from standing in the 2027 French presidential election.",
      "Without even waiting for the judge to pronounce the full details of the sentence, the head of the National Rally knew that her political goose was cooked.",
      "There would be no reprieve pending appeal. The bar on running for office was real and immediate.",
      "A four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended, will be on hold pending appeal.",

      "It was not just Le Pen's followers who said it. Her enemies agreed, from Jean-Luc Melenchon on the far left to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou in the centre and Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin on the right.",

      "Maybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.",
      "So as they met in an emergency session after the verdict, party leaders were in a dilemma.",
      "Do they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?",
      "In theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.",
      "A different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.",
      "Or, should they proceed with plan B \u2013 that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Marine Le Pen's place?",
      "That might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead. But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly.  And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan.",

      "Denouncing what she called a \"political\" decision by the judge and a \"violation of the state of law\", she called for a swift appeal trial, so that her name could be cleared \u2013 or at least the ineligibility lifted \u2013 in time for the 2027 vote.",
      "\"There are millions of French people who believe in me. For 30 years I have been fighting against injustice. It is what I shall continue to do right to the end,\" she said.",
      "Fighting words \u2013 but in reality the future looks very unclear. And there are many unanswered questions.",
      "What, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?",
      "In the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".",
      "No-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.",
      "By the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.",
      "Longer term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.",
      "Jordan Bardella is a popular figure too, but at just 29 it is hard to see him filling her shoes. If Marine Le Pen is indeed unable to run in 2027, the RN loses much of its appeal.",
      "What is certain is that many would-be candidates on the non-RN right \u2013 Laurent Wauquiez, Bruno Retailleau for example \u2013 would see in a Bardella candidacy a big opportunity for themselves.",
      "The other unknown is vengeance.",
      "Marine Le Pen remains a member of the National Assembly, where she leads a bloc of 125 \u2013 the parliament's biggest.  Till now she had been benign towards the beleaguered prime minister Francois Bayrou, who struggles on despite having no majority.",
      "Those days may be over.",
      "Why should we do anyone any favours now, they will be saying at RN HQ. Why not bring the house down?",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/val-kilmer-actor-known-for-the-doors-and-tombstone-dies-at-65/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:20:49 -0400",
    "summary": "A unique talent, Val Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable.",
    "story": [
      "Val Kilmer, the acclaimed, brooding actor who starred in a string of blockbuster hits in the 1980s and 1990s, has died at the age of 65.",
      "Kilmer died Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, his daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Val Kilmer died from pneumonia. He had recovered after a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required two tracheotomies.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Kilmer's death.",
      "A unique talent, Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable. Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",
      "His last major film credit was in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which he reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.",
      "Toward the end of \"Val,\" the 2021 documentary on his career, Kilmer said, \"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",
      "His movie career hit its zenith in the early 1990s as he made a name for himself as a dashing leading man, starring alongside Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton in \"Tombstone,\" as Elvis' ghost in \"True Romance\" and as a bank-robbing demolition expert in Mann's film \"Heat\" with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir. He agreed after being promised that his role would improve from the initial script.",
      "Kilmer vs. the Batman costume",
      "One career nadir when he played Batman in Joel Schumacher's goofy, garish \"Batman Forever\" with Nicole Kidman and opposite Chris O'Donnell's Robin - before George Clooney took up the mantle for 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" and after Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight in 1989's \"Batman\" and 1992's \"Batman Returns.\"",
      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",
      "He dated Cher and married and divorced actor Joanne Whalley.",
      "He is survived by their two children, Mercedes and Jack.",

    "summary": "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2.",
    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "Legendary television actor Richard Chamberlain, known as the king of the miniseries for his roles in \"Shogun\" and \"The Thorn Birds,\" has died at the age of 90, his publicist Harlan Boll confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The actor died Saturday, March 29, in Waimanalo, Hawai'i of complications following a stroke. He was two days shy of his 91st birthday.",
      "\"Our beloved Richard is with the angles now,\" his longtime partner, Martin Rabbett, said in a statement. \"He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\"",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, he attended Beverly Hills High and later Pomona College, where he graduated with a degree in art. After a two-year stint in the U.S. Army, stationed in Korea, Chamberlain launched his career when he earned his first TV appearance as a guest spot on Alfred Hitchcock \"Presents.\"",
      "The role that put him on the map was the lead in the TV show \"Dr. Kildare,\" which earned Chamberlain the first of three Golden Globes in his career.",
      "He went on to star in notable films including \"Petulia,\" The Three Musketeers,\" \"The Music Lovers,\" and Peter Weir's \"The Last Wave.\"",
      "His forte, however, remained in the small screen, where he portrayed the likes of King Edward VIII, Octavius Caesar, and Scott Fitzgerald.",
      "Chamberlain also had a brief, yet successful, period as a recording artist, mostly romantic ballads, and was nominated for a Grammy.",
      "On the stage, Chamberlain played the title role in \"Hamlet\" for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England.

    "summary": "President Trump named himself the storied Washington arts center's chairman and replaced board members with Trump allies. Since then, the center has been rocked with cancellations, resignations, and questions about its mission.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is taking center stage at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \"We are going to make a lot of changes,\" he said earlier this month, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\"",
      "He's directing many of those changes as the new chairman of the board. Out are all of President Joe Biden's appointees, replaced with Trump allies.",
      "The Trump White House says an overhaul is needed because the marquee arts center is, in their words, \"woke \u2026 and broke.\"",
      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",
      "Its budget comes mostly from donations. Billionaire businessman and former chairman David Rubenstein has given more than $100 million. He, too, was fired last month. Rutter said, \"To have us both leaving at the same time does cause me some worry, because of the sense of understanding of structure, decision-making, how we go about interpreting our mission, all of those kinds of things.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "But now, conservatives charge the center is \"too liberal,\" highlighting three drag events last year, including a \"Broadway Drag Brunch.\"",
      "Asked whether it was a mistake to host drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I don't think so. I believe that everybody in America has the opportunity to be seen, and to be seen at your national cultural center.\"",
      "She pointed out that the shows Trump referred to in a social media post (\"THIS WILL STOP,\" he promised) represented just three of the 2,000 performances that took place at the Kennedy Center last year.",
      "Asked why the focus was on three drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I can't actually imagine. Drag has been around for centuries. Shakespeare performed in drag, the original Shakespeare.\"",
      "President Trump boycotted the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, after criticism from honorees like Norman Lear. So, what does the new chairman have planned now? In audio obtained by \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" he suggests a new host \u2013 himself:",
      "\"The king of ratings, right? Whether we like it or not, the king of ratings! So, if I was the host of the Honors, and we'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people\u2026\"",
      "So, what kind of people does President Trump want to honor? Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the president who has been on the board since 2020, said, \"There were mentioned a list of people, I remember the name of Pavarotti. I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",
      "Zampolli has suggested changes to make the Kennedy Center \"better\": \"We're on the Potomac River. We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS. One can be thrown in LEO, low orbit, that can circulate in the orbit. And one can be auctioned on the ground of the Kennedy Center, because they need to raise money.\"",
      "Some artists (including those who are LGBTQ) have expressed the belief that they won't be welcome at the Kennedy Center. But Zampolli said, \"I don't think the president have anything against these kind of people. I don't understand what is things 'inclusion' or this 'woke.' The Kennedy Center is accessible for everybody, and has to represent the agenda of America.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees. One thing you won't see at the Center is the musical \"Hamilton.\" Producers cancelled shows after President Trump became chairman. The president's response? \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much. I never liked it.\"",

      "Asked whether there was any political involvement then, Folds replied, \"Never saw anything like this. This is new, and it was quite sudden. Let's say I get in an artist that has different views than the president. Do they feel safe being themselves? Do they feel safe saying what they believe? They're not political shows, but you can express what you'd like to.\"",
      "And is that no longer the case? \"Well, I suspect it's no longer the case,\" Folds said. \"There is an instinct, an authoritarian instinct, that is true in all authoritarian times in history: Take control of the culture, take control of the arts early on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:06:41 -0400",
    "summary": "To young Brandi Carlile, a girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. Today, the two music superstars are friends and collaborators, recording an album together, \"Who Believes in Angels?\"",
    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John has millions of fans all over the world, but few of them as devoted as a young girl who first heard his music more than 30 years ago.",
      "In 1992, Brandi Marie Carlile was a kid living in a single-wide trailer in rural Washington State, and to her, Elton John was everything. Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing. I hope everybody can take some hope and beauty and mysticism from the fact that this has happened. If it could happen to 11-year-old single-wide mobile home Brandi Carlile, it could really happen to anyone.\"",
      "Turns out these two friends don't just lean on each other; they push each other to new heights. The title track of their album is \"Who Believes In Angels?\" But maybe Elton John and Brandi Carlile are angels for each other.",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Who Believes In Angels?\":",
      "John said, \"God, it was a challenge. But that's what life's all about. If you don't have a challenge at 76, then never give up. Never coast. There are so many artists that coast that don't make new songs. They just go around and play their hits, like I did. I didn't wanna do it with this record. I wanted a new start. I want a fresh start.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

      "The Sex Pistols, the legendary English punk band that helped the underground subculture of the genre to reach mainstream heights, is going on its first North American tour in more than 20 years.",
      "The Pistols last went on a North American tour in 2003, when they were joined by original vocalist\u00a0John Lyndon (formerly Rotten).",
      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.\u00a0Tickets go on sale\u00a0April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977's \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols Album\" live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.",
      "That estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on\u00a0auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

    "summary": "President Trump rolled out new tariffs on April 2 aimed at easing trade imbalances. Here's which products could become more expensive as a result.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S.,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "Automobiles",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's previously announced 25% tariff on auto imports, which go into effect today, imported autos will also face the 10% universal tariffs. Some U.S.-made vehicles include parts imported from other countries, which will face new tariffs and increase the purchase price of those cars, experts said.",
      "Ultimately, American consumers could end up paying an additional $2,500 to $5,000 for the lowest-cost American cars, and up to $20,000 for some imported models, according to an April 2 estimate from Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Clothing and shoes",
      "The bulk of apparel and shoes sold in U.S. stores like Walmart and Target is manufactured outside the U.S., with China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among the biggest exporters.",
      "All three nations will face reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration, at 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam and 37% for Bangladesh.",
      "Wine and spirits",
      "Italian and French wines and Scottish whisky are also likely to rise in price, as European Union imports will face a reciprocal tariff of 20% while United Kingdom-made products will face a 10% import duty.",
      "Furniture",
      "About 30% to 40% of furniture sold in the U.S. is manufactured in other countries, according to CNBC. Top exporters of furniture to the U.S. include China and Vietnam.",
      "Coffee and chocolate",
      "The U.S. imports about 80% of its coffee beans from Latin American countries such as Brazil and Colombia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Both nations are included in Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, with each facing rates of 10%.",
      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans. Among the nations that export cocoa beans to the country are Cote d'Ivoire and Ecuador, according to the USDA. Those nations will face reciprocal tariffs of 21% and 10%, respectively.",
      "Swiss watches",
      "Swiss imports to the U.S. will face a new reciprocal tariff of 31%, which will impact watches from affordable brands such as Swatch to pricey timepieces manufactured by the likes of Rolex.",

    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday announced the U.S. will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, as well as higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports, despite warnings from economists over\u00a0increased prices.",
      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",
      "As he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,",
      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"horrendous\" trade imbalances have hurt the U.S. and put national security at risk, placing blame on previous U.S. presidents and administrations.",
      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",
      "Here are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:",

      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S. The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",

    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Other experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.",
      "For example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",

      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",

    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's forthcoming tariffs on automobiles threaten\u00a0to make cars more expensive, and some consumers are responding by heading to dealerships before the levies go into effect.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced a 25% tariff rate on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., which are set to go into effect April 2.",
      "The levies will result in higher costs for auto manufacturers, which are expected to pass on\u00a0at least some of the extra expense to consumers. With car prices expected to rise under the tariffs, experts\u00a0are advising shoppers in the market for new vehicles to buy them now, in order to avoid paying thousands of dollars more under the auto tariffs.",
      "\"Vehicles on lots and the inventory that exists today has not been impacted by tariffs, so it's a good time to buy a car,\" Joe McCabe, president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, a provider of automobile industry insights, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has to fit within the financial boundaries of the consumer, but this would be the preferred time to do it.\"",
      "There's evidence that consumers are following that advice. In its first-quarter sales report Tuesday, Ford said buyers flocked to its dealerships, ahead of anticipated increases in car prices.",
      "Retail sales \u2014 or direct-to-consumer-sales \u2014 rose 5% in the first quarter, driven by a 19% surge during the month of March, the Michigan-based automaker reported. The company did not state outright that the bump was related to Trump's upcoming tariff announcement.",
      "Burlington, Vermont-based artist Val Hird is among the consumers who rushed to lock in a deal on her vehicle of choice before April 2, which Mr. Trump has referred to as \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "A day before Mr. Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on vehicles on auto parts imported into the U.S., Hird had decided to purchase a vehicle, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hird said she had wanted a Toyota RAV4 Plug-in hybrid, but her local Toyota dealer did not have the car in stock. \"I would have ordered one, except we just found out there are going to be tariffs. So, we assumed if it's not yet in the country, or in transit to the country, that would probably throw it into the 'who knows what the price will be' category,\" she said of her reluctance to place an order on a new car.",
      "Instead, Hird located a used version of her preferred car model at another dealership in Rhode Island, which she \"leapt to the phone\" to buy.",
      "She ultimately paid $45,453 for the pre-owned Toyota hybrid. Had that particular model not been available, Hird said she would have forewent the purchase of a car altogether and waited to see how the trade war progressed.",
      "\"I don't live in a world where I can spend an extra $10,000,\" Hird said of the anticipated tariff-related price hikes on cars.",
      "Tariff talk at dealerships grows",
      "Analysts say that tariffs are top of mind for consumers, with dealers saying consumers are increasingly weaving talk of the levies into their car-buying conversations.",
      "Data from Cox Automotive, which owns several popular car insight sites, including Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader and Dealer.com, shows a dramatic uptick in car shopping activity in recent days. There was a 27% uptick in visits to Kelly Blue Book Thursday after Mr. Trump announced 25% auto tariffs.",
      "On Friday, users logged 54% more new car leads on Dealer.com, meaning they submitted inquiries to dealers about vehicles they were interested in buying. Auto Trader notched an uptick of 16% in used car leads.",
      "\"It makes a lot of sense; I would assume that people would have gotten started researching to see what things look like now,\" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "More pressure on cost-conscious to buy now",
      "Car prices are likely to rise when tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"With Trump's 'Liberation Day' here it is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a U.S. consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. \"We stress that the concept of a U.S. car maker with parts all from the U.S. is a fictional tale that does not exist and would take years to make this concept a reality.\"",
      "By contrast, vehicles currently sitting on dealers' lots are insulated from the levies.",
      "\"If consumers are seeing prices on lots saying, 'here's the tariff adjustment cost,' they should challenge that, because sitting inventory is not subject to tariffs,\" Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief of Cars.com, a car buying marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch. He noted that existing inventory is relatively stable. \"There are vehicles to be had, we aren't seeing an inventory crunch right now.\"",
      "Indeed, McCabe said dealers are seeing increased interest in vehicles on lots from consumers, and \"are going to be more picky on their consumers to get the best price they can.\"",
      "Said McCabe, \"They know the supply and demand issue will change pretty quickly with the tariff impact.\"",
      "That's why his advice to consumers who need a new car is to start shopping now. \"If you need car and can afford it, get out there now,\" he said.",
      "In particular, motorists on the lower end of the income scale should consider making their car purchases immediately, he said, because any kind of price hike could push them out of the market for a vehicle altogether.",
      "\"There's a cost-conscious consumer that if you start tariffing them, they'll stop buying the vehicle because it doesn't fit in their budget,\" McCabe said.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "The company said on Wednesday that it shipped 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter, down from the 386,810 in the year ago period. The latest deliveries fell short of expectations that the EV maker had likely shipped about 350,000 vehicles during the period, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "The decline comes amid protests held at Tesla dealerships both in the U.S. and Europe over CEO Elon Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Under Musk's leadership, DOGE has pushed the Trump administration to shutter\u00a0federal agencies, slashing tens of thousands of jobs, as he seeks to cut government spending.",
      "\"[T]his delivery number was a disaster for the bulls with continuous negativity around the TSLA brand,\" Ives said in his note. \"We are not going to look at these numbers with rose-colored glasses ... they were a disaster on every metric.\"",
      "Ives, who said earlier said he had expected Tesla to report it had delivered as many as 360,000 vehicles during the first quarter, added that he believes Musk \"needs to stop this political firestorm and balance being CEO of Tesla with DOGE.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla slumped $12.77, or 4.8%, to $255.69 in early trading. The stock has plunged about 44% since hitting a high of $479 per share in December, when the stock soared on expectations that Musk's advisory role with the Trump administration would help the business through lower regulations and other benefits.",
      "Tesla's problems extend beyond the backlash over Musk's work with DOGE, however. The company's aging lineup is failing to attract buyers, although the automaker is expected to roll out a new lower-cost model later this year.",
      "In the meantime, some EV buyers are choosing to buy vehicles from rival automakers, with competitors from BMW to Toyota now offering a range of electric, hybrid or plug-in hybrid options. To some extent, Tesla's woes predate Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, with the company's revenue slipping 1%\u00a0last year, partly due to sluggish sales in the first six months of 2024.",
      "Still, the slump in 2025's first-quarter deliveries points to the backlash that some consumers are voicing over Musk's role in the Trump administration, Ives noted, adding that the more political the billionaire becomes, \"the more the brand suffers.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.",
      "Meanwhile, car insurance premiums are also likely to jump because the tariffs will make it more expensive to repair vehicles, partly due to higher costs for purchasing new auto parts.",
      "Average insurance premiums could rise to $2,759, or a 19% bump from the typical cost in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a new projection from Insurify. That increase would come after car insurance costs jumped 11% in February from a year earlier, making it one of the fastest-rising components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation.",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means an $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmissions from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:27:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans say the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal app is serious.",
    "story": [
      "After a week that brought tough economic news and polling showing Americans'\u00a0views of the economy\u00a0are still sour, most say President Trump has focused too much on tariffs \u2014 which they believe will end up raising prices \u2014 and not enough on lowering prices.",
      "This has Americans collectively skeptical right now about the ability of Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off, a sentiment that was key to the success of his 2024 campaign.",
      "Yet that's balanced out for Mr. Trump today by continued majority approval on immigration and on his deportation program, specifically. That comes especially \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 from his Republican base, many of whom say that's just as important as the economy in their evaluations.",
      "Meanwhile, the public continues to weigh the changes brought by the federal workforce reductions, with many believing they will impact programs they care about.",
      "But the matter involving administration officials' use of the Signal app, while seen as serious, does not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall.",
      "From a list of items, most say the administration is focused too much on tariffs, and by contrast, is not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Donald Trump won the 2024 election in large part on the economy and the idea that he'd make Americans financially better off.",
      "Just before he took office, a sizable four in 10 felt his policies as president would do just that.",
      "Asked about what's happening today, just a quarter of Americans say those policies are making them financially better off. Nearly twice as many say he's making their finances worse.",
      "Even among Republicans, things have tempered. Just before he took office, three-fourths of Republicans said Mr. Trump's policies as president would make them better off, and now, under half of them say that's what is happening so far.",
      "Tariffs, or the threat of them, don't seem to be helping.",
      "Most oppose new tariffs, as they have for a while, and big numbers think that'll lead to higher prices in the short term.",
      "The administration has argued that tariffs will have long-term benefits, but people are more inclined to think they'll raise prices rather than lower them in the long term, too. Tariffs on imported cars in particular aren't popular, either.",
      "(Prices, of course, have been a key concern for years. They are the number one reason that people still rate the economy badly,\u00a0according to recent polling.)",
      "Importantly, though, Mr. Trump doesn't fully \"own\" the issue. Joe Biden still gets a little more blame for today's inflation rate than Mr. Trump does.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval for handling inflation specifically remains negative, and his rating on handling the economy in general has edged into negative territory since last month.",
      "That balances against net-positive ratings for immigration (which are extremely positive with Republicans), and he's even overall.",
      "His overall approval rating has ticked down just a point from last month and is a few points lower than at the start of his term, though it remains above what he got at any point during his first term.",
      "Trump's deportation program, specifically, retains majority approval. That hasn't really changed in recent weeks.",
      "As for some potential implications, as a general principle it's not acceptable to most if some legal U.S. residents were to be mistakenly detained by immigration authorities. But half of Republicans say it would be acceptable.",
      "Judges and the courts",
      "Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of judicial review of the legality of Mr. Trump's policies, including most Republicans. But there's also been calls from some to try to impeach federal judges who rule against Mr. Trump's policies, and that also finds favor with a majority of Republicans, especially those who identify as part of the MAGA movement.",
      "Federal workforce and DOGE",
      "Views on Mr. Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce are evenly split in the country.",
      "One reason is that most think the reductions will impact programs and services they care about. A slight majority still think Musk and DOGE have too much influence \u2014 with Republicans, again, standing differently than other Americans.",
      "On the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal messaging app, most Americans, including most Republicans, say the matter is serious. And most don't think it was appropriate to use the app to discuss military plans.",
      "Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be following this story.",
      "So far, this situation isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation of Mr. Trump. An overwhelming majority of Republicans who describe what happened as very or somewhat serious still approve of him. Four in 10 Republicans do say what happened was appropriate.",
      "And most Americans would not approve of Donald Trump having the U.S. take control of Greenland.",
      "The Role of Congress",
      "Democrats increasingly call for their party in Congress to oppose Trump \u2014 these figures have risen with each poll.",
      "And those Democrats who are calling for this overwhelmingly say their party in Congress could be doing more to oppose him.",
      "Relatively few Americans, including those in his own party, would generally want to see Mr. Trump have more power as president than he already does; they feel he has the right amount now. And they do see a role for the party in Congress. Majorities of Republicans would have their members push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree.",

      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",

      "The agency has also been hit by a bevy of changes. The Social Security Administration announced earlier this month that\u00a0it would require\u00a0in-person identity checks for new and existing beneficiaries, with some limited exemptions. Following backlash to the move, this week it said it was delaying implementation of the policy until April 14.",
      "Also this month, the SSA said that recipients\u00a0would no longer\u00a0be able to change direct deposit and other banking information with the agency by phone, claiming that it could lead to fraud. Recipients will instead be required to use the SSA's online platform or visit a local SSA office.",
      "The moves come as Frank Bisignano, President Trump's nominee to run the SSA,\u00a0faced questions\u00a0during his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday about the potential role of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in the SSA. DOGE is being run by billionaire Elon Musk.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has blocked the mass firings of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday that blocks the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.",
      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",
      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government lawyers have said the plaintiffs are seeking to impermissibly place the CFPB in a \"judicially managed receivership,\" with the court overseeing its day-to-day operations.",
      "Jackson started her 112-page ruling by quoting Mr. Trump and his allies' own words about the bureau. Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone. White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death. The agency found she qualified for loan forgiveness and a $15,000 refund of overpayments, but the stop-work order went into effect before she could have a follow-up meeting and the official she was working with was fired.",
      "\"Steege's fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her student loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died,\" the judge wrote.",

      "Visits from Canada to the U.S. account for the sharpest projected decline in travel this year, with analysts pointing to President Trump's plan to slap tariffs on Canadian imports as causing some Canadians to hold off on traveling to the U.S.",
      "\"This sharp drop suggests that travellers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute,\" the report states.",
      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "Weaker-than-usual demand could lead to deals on airfare for passengers who still plan to travel from Canada to the U.S., OAG said.",
      "\"For those that are still planning to travel there may be some airlines offering particularly cheap airfares over the next few months as they seek to stimulate demand but for the airlines it will be a nervous few months, especially as the traditional 'snowbird' market from Canada to the U.S. could be badly impacted next year if the situation doesn't improve quickly,\" the report states.",
      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",
      "Canadian airlines are expected to be hit harder than their American counterparts because the nation's residents are driving the downward trend, experts say. Americans typically prefer to fly American airlines because they might have loyalty accounts with a carrier, for example.",
      "Flair Airlines, a budget airline based in Canada, said last week it is cutting flights from Toronto to Nashville, as well as from Calgary to Las Vegas and Edmonton to Las Vegas.",
      "\"These are thee types of routes they are not confident in being able to sell at a rate that would make it profitable, so they are re-allocating some of the lax capacity elsewhere,\" Keyes said.",

      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",

      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",
      "Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.",
      "The Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.",
      "During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"",
      "Jennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.",
      "\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.",
      "Jennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.",
      "On March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.",
      "Over the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.",
      "Jennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.",
      "\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"",
      "Jennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.",
      "While it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department has argued\u00a0that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.",
      "Jennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.",
      "\"He's not a criminal,\" Jennifer said. \"My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

      "\"As I've said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,\" Adams said. \"I am now happy that our city can finally close the book and focus solely on the future of our great city. I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.\"",
      "He offered an apology to New Yorkers.",
      "\"I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams said New Yorkers are his \"north star\" and he thinks about them every day.",
      "\"I'm a New Yorker, and this is the greatest city on the globe, and it's a privilege being your mayor, something I did not take for granted one day, and I'm going to continue to serve you,\" Adams said. \"As I have repeatedly said, I have always been solely beholden to the people of this city. No special interests, no political opponents, but just everyday New Yorkers. Just you, and I'm going to continue to do that. So today we turn the page, we move forward together.\"",
      "Before he went back into Gracie Mansion, Adams held up a copy of \"Government Gangsters,\" a book by FBI Director Kash Patel.",
      "\"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\" Adams said.",
      "More on the judge's ruling",
      "Judge Ho's decision includes words Adams' opponents are sure to focus in on: \"Everything here smacks of a bargain, dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.\"",
      "In his ruling to dismiss the case with prejudice, Judge Ho took issue with the Department of Justice's request to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning he could've faced trial on the same charges again at a later time.",
      "Judge Ho summarized the DOJ's reasoning to drop the case as based on three things: It's tainted with impropriety, detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement, and was a weak case to begin with.",
      "\"There  may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ, if  taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging  like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"And there are many reasons to be troubled by DOJ's proffered rationales\u2014further supporting dismissal with prejudice.\"",
      "Judge Ho also addressed why he couldn't continue to pursue the case after the DOJ moved to dismiss it.",
      "\"Some will undoubtedly find today's decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the  Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue  the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that  would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"Therefore, any  decision by this Court to deny the Government's Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because  DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case,  inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor's right to a speedy  trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the  June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\"",
      "\"To be clear, the Court again emphasizes that it does not express any opinion as to the merits  of the case or whether the prosecution of Mayor Adams 'should' move forward,\" Judge Ho added.",
      "Read the judge's order in full",
      "Read the judge's order in full",
      "\"Legally speaking, he is innocent until proven guilty, and he will never be proven guilty - that is an unequivocal, it is rare when we can rarely say things that definitively - but he will never face legal consequences for the allegations that were against him in this case,\" Hofstra Law Professor James Sample said.",
      "Impact on the mayor's race",
      "The timing of the decision to drop the case is critical for Adams, who is facing a Thursday midnight deadline to file petitions to run for mayor in New York City's Democratic primary.",
      "The decision means Adams is now free to run without the threat of going to jail, or facing a politically damaging trial.",
      "CBS News New York has learned that Adams is immediately jumping into the political fray, and he plans to participate in a mayoral candidates forum sponsored by the National Action Network Thursday.",
      "\"He looks forward to engaging with fellow candidates and community leaders to discuss the future of our great city,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Since there's no possibility of the charges against him resurfacing, Adams can also say he is not beholden to President Trump or his administration, since they can no longer bring the same case against him. Adams has repeatedly said that, and just Tuesday night, New York City joined a suit against the Trump administration to challenge cuts that would cost New York City $100 million in CDC funding.",
      "\"When federal policies directly impact our city, we have been, and will continue to be, the first and loudest to advocate for New Yorkers. These funds are crucial in protecting public health, and the reversal will have serious consequences for communities across the five boroughs,\" Adams said in his statement Tuesday night.",
      "Even before Adams officially learned that his case had been dropped, Adams made it clear at a National Action Network event Wednesday that suggestions he was \"under the finger\" of President Trump were, in his mind, false.",
      "\"I do not know who you think I'm under the finger of,\" Adams said Wednesday morning. \"But I'm on the finger of Eric Adams, the mayor of the city of New York, and I'm going to continue to do so.\"",
      "Adams also made an argument voters can expect to hear if he seeks another term.",
      "\"I'm the same person that made sure we put $17 billion in the [minority and women-owned businesses] in this city, that invested in foster care children, that built more housing in year one and year two of our administration than in the history of this city,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams has not made clear how he intends to run for re-election - as a Democrat, independent, or perhaps even as a Republican.",
      "Adams has previously told CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer to expect twists and turns in the upcoming mayoral election.",
      "Adams' opposition speaks out",
      "The mayor's detractors were also speaking out.",
      "\"Either way, I think there was tremendous damage that was done to this city because of an Adams administration, so the quickest we can get away from this administration, I think the better for the city,\" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.",
      "\"It's absolutely disgusting. You have a man that broke the law. We want to remind people that it wasn't just about flight upgrades. This was a man who illegally held a campaign donor scheme, and the fact that the judge unfortunately bowed to Trump is appalling,\" mayoral candidate Michael Blake said.",
      "\"The ruling does not change the facts: Eric Adams works for Donald Trump, not New Yorkers,\" mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said.",
      "\"Eric Adams has sold out New Yorkers and put himself above the public at every chance he could. Even the judge in the case agrees: this slimy deal reeks of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration. In exchange for his freedom, Adams has looked the other way while the federal government detains and disappears New Yorkers, steals money from our city, and wages war on working people. Adams should resign in disgrace,\" mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said.",
      "Move to drop charges sparked resignations",
      "The DOJ memo seeking to drop the charges set off a spate of resignations that started in City Hall, at the very heart of Adams' inner circle, and reached all the way to the U.S. attorney's office. At issue was then-Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon's allegation that the request to dismiss the case amounted to a quid pro quo, namely Adams' cooperation on President Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for his charges being dropped. Sassoon resigned, rather than drop the charges, as did several other people in the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "The mayor and his attorney pushed back strenuously against the notion of a quid pro quo.",
      "\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney \u00a0Alex Spiro said.",
      "Allegations that Adams had been compromised by the Trump administration and was operating, essentially, under its thumb led\u00a0four New York City deputy mayors to resign\u00a0and spurred numerous calls for Adams to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, then met with key leaders to discuss his future. She ultimately acted to limit Adams' powers in a bid to restore trust in government, but said she wouldn't remove him.",
      "What Adams has been accused of",
      "Last September, federal prosecutors alleged Adams had been abusing his power for almost a decade. They said he solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In the\u00a057-page indictment, Adams was accused of receiving gifts he didn't disclose, including luxury travel, worth more than $100,000, in return for political favors.",
      "\"These upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or loyalty program available to the general public. As we allege, this was a multi-year scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" then-U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District Damian Williams\u00a0said as he announced the indictment.",
      "Prosecutors accused Adams of pressuring FDNY officials to approve the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan, despite fire safety concerns.",
      "The Adams campaign was also accused of using \"straw donors\" for illicit contributions, enabling it to tap into $10 million in matching funds.",
      "\"These are bright red lines, and we allege that the mayor crossed them again and again for years,\" Williams said.",
      "Before the DOJ stepped in, prosecutors appeared to be ramping up their case, claiming they had uncovered\u00a0\"additional criminal conduct.\"",
      "Adams associates also under investigation",
      "The historic indictment came amid\u00a0multiple investigations into Adams' campaign, as well as other administration officials.",
      "Numerous top members of the Adams administration resigned before the indictment was announced, including former\u00a0NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban\u00a0and\u00a0his twin brother, James Caban. Former\u00a0Schools Chancellor David Banks\u00a0and his wife, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and his brother, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III, were also investigated.",
      "Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a longtime Adams advisor, pleaded not guilty to bribery, money laundering and conspiracy\u00a0in a case involving her son and two real estate developers. The mayor's former liaison for the Muslim community, Mohamed Bahi, was also\u00a0charged with conspiracy for his role in collecting illegal donations\u00a0for Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and\u00a0has agreed to plead guilty, according to court documents.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/liberation-day-trump-tariffs-explained/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:11:42 -0400",
    "summary": "On April 2, President Trump unveiled a universal import duty of 10% on all products, as well as reciprocal tariffs on imports from 60 nations.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, or what he's calling \"Liberation Day,\" aimed at erasing trade deficits between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "The two new tariffs are:",
      "A 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.So-called reciprocal tariffs that will be applied to imports from 60 nations.",
      "A 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.",
      "So-called reciprocal tariffs that will be applied to imports from 60 nations.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.",
      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.",
      "That estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on\u00a0auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate approved a measure Wednesday aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked President Trump.",
      "In a 51 to 48 vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. But the House is unlikely to take up the resolution, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "Joining Democrats in support of the measure were Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and former GOP leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, would terminate the national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Kaine forced the vote under the National Emergencies Act, bypassing Senate Republican leadership.",
      "The president first threatened the tariffs on Canada and Mexico in January, touting a need to enhance border security and stop the flow of fentanyl over the nation's borders, before they were twice delayed.",
      "Kaine, who called the tariffs \"attacks on everyday people,\" said ahead of the vote that the president has justified the imposition of these tariffs on \"a made up emergency.\" He argued that while fentanyl is a \"real emergency,\" it's not from Canada, while warning that the Canadian tariffs will tax groceries and food products, building supplies, fertilizers, along with materials that produce ships and submarines and implicate U.S. national security.",
      "With 47 Democrats and independents in the chamber, the resolution required the support of at least four Republicans for approval. Mr. Trump put pressure on the GOP leading up to the vote, urging that \"Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge.\"",
      "\"Don't let the Democrats have a Victory,\" the president said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday. \"It would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States.\"",
      "Ahead of the vote, the president called out the Republican senators who supported the measure, saying in a post in the wee hours Wednesday that \"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change.\"",
      "\"The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve,\" Mr. Trump continued, asking the senators' constituents to reach out to them.",
      "\"They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,\" the president added.",
      "Thune criticized the measure ahead of the vote, warning that it could threaten efforts to stop fentanyl from entering the country.",
      "\"We would be wrong to view this as solely a southern border problem,\" Thune said, arguing that cartels will expand fentanyl smuggling operations at the northern border if it's not addressed.",
      "The majority leader pledged that Republicans intend to keep a promise to \"end the lawlessness at our borders.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to join Democrats in supporting the resolution, calling the tariffs a \"tax increase on American families, plain and simple.\"",
      "\"Every single Senate Republican should support Tim's resolution, and support American families,\" Schumer said.",
      "The New York Democrat cited Mr. Trump's urging of the GOP to oppose the measure, claiming that the president is \"very worried\" about the resolution.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 18:35:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has targeted international students in wake of pro-Palestinian protests and other activities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's crackdown on students who participated in pro-Palestinian activities has raised questions about the First Amendment rights of visa and green card holders amid the shocking detentions of a number of students at Tufts, Columbia and other universities in recent weeks.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the nation's top diplomat to revoke the visas of foreign national students on the grounds that their presence or activities have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.",
      "The federal government is not required to lay out proof beyond that explanation, legal experts told CBS News, setting up a legal showdown over foreign nationals' free speech rights in the U.S.",
      "\"There's a tension between everyone's First Amendment rights to free speech and the immigration statute's broad provisions giving the secretary of state broad latitude to declare someone deportable simply because he thinks that the student may have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. And the courts will have to figure out where the appropriate line should be drawn,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University.",
      "Rubio said Thursday the State Department has canceled more than 300 visas and that they're \"primarily\" student visas. Several high-profile cases are related to students who led or participated in pro-Palestinian activities and disruptive protests, which the administration has equated to activity supporting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",
      "He also told reporters that if the administration is compelled to provide evidence in court, it will, but said \"judges don't issue student visas. There's no right to a student visa.\"",
      "\"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we've given you a visa, and then you decide to do that, we're going to take it away,\" Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.",
      "In targeting students, the Trump administration is enforcing the statute differently than past administrations, according to immigration lawyer Jonathan Grode.",
      "\"This administration hasn't changed the law,\" Grode said. \"They're just telling the referees to call the game differently. They're saying, be stricter, use all the tools you have available to effectuate this behavior. That's the big difference. That's why it feels so jarring.\"",
      "\"With the Trump administration, they're pushing this to such a degree that it's creating concern, hysteria, reaction, litigation,\" he added.",
      "A visa revocation does not automatically result in a person's deportation, which is handled by the Department of Homeland Security and requires due process. Several of the students are sitting in detention facilities as the government seeks to deport them.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wearing masks and in plain clothes in Massachusetts on Tuesday, March 25.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Wednesday that Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk's friends have said she is being punished for co-authoring an opinion piece in the Tufts Daily campus newspaper in 2024, where she called on the school to divest from Israel and \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" but never mentioned Hamas.",
      "Tufts University said in a statement April 2 that the op-ed was consistent with the university's policy on freedom of expression, and that it has \"no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "\"The University has seen an outpouring of support for Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty and staff. These individuals have described Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits and committed to her colleagues,\" Tufts said.",
      "The case followed another high-profile detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University grad student who had been active in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last year. Khalil, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, has a green card, or legal permanent residency, and his wife is an American citizen. Immigration authorities initially told Khalil that they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that he had a green card, the agent said they were revoking that according to his attorney.",
      "Green cards, however, cannot be rescinded as simply as visas. The government suggested in a court filing earlier this week that it could move to revoke his status for allegedly omitting information on his immigration forms, including his involvement with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "But at the core of the U.S. government's detention and aimed deportation of Khalil is a rarely used section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that subjects noncitizens to possible deportation if their presence and activities are deemed threatening to the foreign policy interests of the U.S.",
      "This same law was used to detain Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national who was taken into custody by masked agents March 17 in Virginia. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "The government using that law is also trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Chung came to the U.S. from South Korea with her family when she was 7.",
      "Yale-Loehr recalled two other cases where similar powers were invoked in deportation proceedings. In 1987, it was used in a case involving eight people who either held valid student visas or were lawful permanent residents for their pro-Palestinian activism. The deportation case dragged on for 20 years and ended with a judge calling the government's actions \"an embarrassment to the rule of law.\" In the 1990s, the government tried to deport a former Mexican official who was in the U.S. on a visa and faced charges in his home country. The then secretary of state said his deportation was necessary for foreign policy matters.",
      "Attorneys in the recent cases have accused the Trump administration of using immigration enforcement to suppress speech it disagrees with.",
      "Grode said the crackdown could have a chilling effect on the First Amendment. The Trump administration, which ran on a free speech platform, is \"creeping in on attacking some of the very fundamental principles that make America America,\" he said. Still, noncitizens having First Amendment rights \"doesn't negate the ability of the government to revoke their visa,\" he added.",
      "Yale-Loehr expects it will take years for these cases to be settled, predicting that \"it's going to be a mess.\"",
      "\"If there's over 300 students who had their visas revoked, there's going to be a lot of cases challenging it,\" he said. \"I suspect that the litigation will take years to unravel before a court and get a definitive ruling on the extent to which foreign nationals have First Amendment rights.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced the U.S. will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with further \"reciprocal tariffs.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday announced the U.S. will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, as well as higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports, despite warnings from economists over\u00a0increased prices.",
      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",
      "As he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,",
      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"horrendous\" trade imbalances have hurt the U.S. and put national security at risk, placing blame on previous U.S. presidents and administrations.",
      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",
      "Here are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:",
      "China \u2014 34%\u00a0European Union \u2014 20%Taiwan \u2014 32%South Korea \u2014 25%India \u2014 26%Israel \u2014 17%\u00a0Nicaragua \u2014 18%Norway \u2014 15%Jordan \u2014 20%",
      "China \u2014 34%",
      "European Union \u2014 20%",
      "Taiwan \u2014 32%",

      "Nicaragua \u2014 18%",
      "Norway \u2014 15%",
      "Jordan \u2014 20%",
      "Countries that will see only the baseline 10% tariff rates include: Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the United Kingdom.",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S. The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",
      "\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans unveiled a budget resolution as the GOP seeks to move forward with the budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda later this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans unveiled a budget resolution on Wednesday, as the GOP seeks to move forward with the budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda later this week.",
      "The Senate Budget committee released the 70-page budget resolution on Wednesday, which would serve as a blueprint, directing congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. The plan is a key step toward implementing the president's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes. It aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, along with authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The blueprint is a compromise resolution that comes after a key meeting between Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and top tax leaders last week. Though House and Senate Republicans had previously forged ahead with their own budget blueprints in recent weeks, the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to continue on in the reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,\" Thune said in a statement as the resolution was released.",
      "Thune said the budget resolution will \"pave the way for a generational investment in border security and national defense and unleash American energy dominance,\" while demonstrating a commitment to \"reducing the size and scope of the federal government by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.\"",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "The Senate majority leader outlined to reporters earlier Wednesday that he plans to file the resolution on the floor after its release, which would start a clock of up to 50 hours of debate and set up a late week vote-a-rama, where senators are allowed to introduce an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to vote through the night. The timeline could set the House on a path to adopt the changes to the budget resolution next week, delivering a key win for President Trump and congressional Republicans before lawmakers leave town for Easter recess.",
      "The budget resolution's release comes as the majority leader and Senate Budget Committee Republicans met with President Trump earlier Wednesday at the White House, where Thune said committee members aired their views with the president.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the meeting that the members made the point that their priorities are to extend the Trump tax cuts, to further refine the tax code to encourage growth and extend the debt limit while reducing spending. And he noted that the meeting allayed some of the concerns of budget hawks.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said after the meeting that feels \"a lot more comfortable\" with the budget resolution, saying \"there's just a real commitment to returning the federal budget to a reasonable pre-pandemic baseline.\"",
      "The development also comes as Senate Republicans opted to proceed without the Senate parliamentarian's sign off, arguing in recent days that they don't need the parliamentarian's permission to move ahead with the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing.",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Kennedy reiterated the widely held GOP position Wednesday that \"we don't need the parliamentarian's permission,\" arguing that the Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, has the authority to make that decision on the current policy baseline. He projected that Senate Democrats will challenge it, but \"they'll lose.\"",
      "Graham said in a statement upon the resolution's release that \"I have determined that current policy will be the budget baseline regarding taxation.\"",
      "\"This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent \u2013 which will tremendously boost the economy,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "summary": "Here are the takeaways from a liberal's victory in Wisconsin and GOP wins in Florida races to succeed Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz in Tuesday's elections.",
    "story": [
      "A closely watched election for a state supreme court judgeship in Wisconsin gave Democrats a boost Tuesday night, while two special elections in Florida delivered two seats to House Speaker Mike Johnson's perilously thin GOP majority. Though off-year and special elections attract a much smaller share of voters than presidential elections, the outcomes in both states held insights for Democrats and Republicans for the months ahead. Here are some of the takeaways:",
      "Wisconsin State Supreme Court race",
      "A setback for Trump and Musk",
      "Despite heavy financial backing from Elon Musk and groups tied to him \u2014 over $20 million \u2014 and an endorsement by President Trump, conservative candidate Brad Schimel lost by a 10-point margin to Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race. Musk's infusion of millions failed to sway Wisconsin voters in this statewide judicial race, marking a notable political defeat in a battleground state that Trump narrowly flipped in 2024.",
      "Crawford ran primarily against Musk's involvement in the state \u2014 and national Democrats could convert this win into an early game plan heading into the gubernatorial races later this year, and the 2026 midterms.",
      "Record-breaking spending of over $90 million",
      "The race became the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, with total spending exceeding $90 million and by some projections, reaching $100 million. This unprecedented influx of money \u2014 fueled by big-dollar donors on both sides of the race including Elon Musk, George Soros, JB Pritzker and others, underscores the growing nationalization and politicization of state judicial races and raises questions about the influence of outside interests on local races.",
      "In the battle of the billionaire donors waged in this judicial race, there was no bigger loser than Musk, who donated $3 million to the state GOP and groups associated with him spent more than $20 million. The efforts of the world's richest man also galvanized Democratic voters in Wisconsin to cast their ballot for Crawford according to Wisconsin Democrats.",
      "What Tuesday could mean for Musk's future political spending",
      "It will be worth watching how much the outcome impacts the way Musk invests his financial and political capital between now and the 2026 midterms, given the loss he sustained in the Wisconsin race.",
      "With Musk's help, Republicans won the White House and Senate in the 2024 election, while also maintaining control of the House. In the 2026 midterms, however, the GOP faces challenges in its quest to hold onto and build on its narrow House majority. The interest in Tuesday's race not just from voters, but also major Democratic donors, suggests a large influx of cash is likely to be invested in both sides at a time when the president's party is at risk of heavy losses amid pushback by voters.",
      "High voter engagement",
      "Turnout was exceptionally high for a spring election and a judicial race, potentially surpassing 2.4 million voters, far exceeding the 2023 state supreme court race, according to CBS News estimates. This surge, coupled with Crawford's strong performance in key areas like Dane County, indicates a strong mobilization among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, driven by concern about the policies of the new Trump administration and opposition to Musk's involvement.",
      "It also suggests broader interest from the Wisconsin electorate about judicial independence on issues like abortion rights and congressional redistricting.",
      "Liberal majority on Wisconsin State Supreme Court retained",
      "Crawford's victory ensured that the Wisconsin Supreme Court maintained its 4-3 liberal majority. This outcome preserves the ideological balance of the state's highest court that has been in place since 2023.\u00a0 This has already led to significant rulings favoring progressive priorities, such as striking down Republican-drawn legislative maps and addressing voting rights issues.",
      "A boost for Democrats",
      "In speaking with national Democrats after the Wisconsin election results, they say that the win has boosted Democrats nationally as they contend with intraparty squabbling on the direction of the party going into the 2026 midterms. With the Badger State race as a referendum on Musk and Trump policies, the outcome of Tuesday's election could also serve as a cautionary tale for Republicans as they prepare for the 2025 gubernatorial races and 2026. To many they saw it as a referendum on voter enthusiasm.",
      "Trump touts voter ID win",
      "Despite Schimel's loss, President Trump posted on social media to highlight one win for conservatives: Wisconsin voters approved a measure to enshrine the state's voter ID requirement in the state constitution. The law, which already mandates showing a photo ID at the polls, now holds the added weight of a constitutional amendment.",
      "Florida special congressional elections",
      "Republican victories with narrower margins",
      "Republicans Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine won the 1st and 6th Districts in Florida Tuesday, respectively, maintaining GOP control of the deep-red seats vacated by Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz. Their victories came with dramatically reduced margins compared to the 2024 general election a few months ago, however. Patronis defeated Gay Valimonti 57-42%, a 15-point margin, and Fine also won his race against Democrat Josh Weil with a 57-42% victory, a sharp drop from Waltz's 33-point victory in November.",
      "Democratic over-performance in fundraising",
      "Democrats outperformed expectations in two deep-red Florida districts on Tuesday, fueled by massive fundraising hauls that far surpassed their Republican opponents. Weil raised more than $9 million, while Valimont brought in roughly $6 million \u2014 numbers that helped make the races far more competitive than anticipated. Republicans held both seats, but with notably closer margins, underscoring the GOP's entrenched advantage in these Trump strongholds.",
      "Still, the Democratic contenders notched a symbolic victory when Valimont carried Escambia County \u2014 a longtime GOP stronghold in presidential elections \u2014 a rare blue dot in the ruby-red district.",
      "Trump's influence tested but intact",
      "Both Patronis and Fine benefited from Mr. Trump's endorsements and late campaign efforts, including tele-town halls and Truth Social posts, which helped secure their wins. Yet the closer-than-expected races, despite the president's personal involvement and his own overwhelming victories in these districts\u00a0 \u2014 68% in the 1st District and 65% in the 6th \u2014 hint at potential political vulnerabilities in his influence early in his second term, especially when Mr. Trump is not on the ballot. The results bolstered the GOP's slim House majority, now 220-213, but the tighter margins signal that Mr. Trump's sway may not be as absolute in off-cycle elections.",
      "Special elections for House remain a challenge for the opposing party",
      "Tuesday's results in Florida line up with CBS News' political unit's analysis this week that since Mr. Trump was first elected president in 2017, a seat has flipped in House special elections less than 15% of the time.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:20:42 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped\u00a0after he was elected to a second term.",
      "Amid the president's targeting of some of the nation's most prominent firms, a split has begun to emerge among the legal community between those subject to punishment by Mr. Trump and a growing number that are entering into deals with the president.",
      "Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments, he announced last week. Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "On Wednesday, the president said on social media that the firm Milbank LLP committed to performing at least $100 million in free legal work during the Trump administration and after on initiatives backed by the president and firm, and also made a series of other commitments.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",
      "\"Sometimes the times call for courage,\" Olson said. \"Are you recognizing that this is one of those times that the ordinary calculations aren't good enough, the calculations that would do against many ordinary sorts of danger? This is an extraordinary danger. Maybe it calls for extraordinary courage.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:50:36 -0400",
    "summary": "South Carolina in 2018 moved to terminate a Planned Parenthood affiliate's participation in its state Medicaid program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court weighed Wednesday a yearslong court fight over South Carolina's attempt to boot Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program and whether beneficiaries can sue to enforce their ability to see their preferred health care provider.",
      "South Carolina moved to withhold Medicaid funds from a Planned Parenthood affiliate in 2018, four years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left the issue of abortion policy to the states. But since that then, the landscape for abortion care has shifted drastically, with a\u00a0dozen states\u00a0enacting near-total bans on abortion and another four states, including South Carolina, outlawing the procedure after six weeks gestation.",
      "While Planned Parenthood provides abortion services outside of Medicaid as allowed under state laws, anti-abortion rights groups and lawmakers at the state and federal levels have long been working to keep public health dollars away from the group. Its clinics also offer contraception, pregnancy testing, gender-affirming care and screenings for cancer and conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.",
      "The question in the case is a technical one: whether Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that allows them to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing. But if South Carolina prevails in the dispute, it could pave the way for more states to defund Planned Parenthood through their state Medicaid plans.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, appeared divided over whether Medicaid recipients can sue under a federal civil rights law to enforce the provision, known as the any-qualified provider requirement.",
      "\"We need something that's out of the ordinary that signals to the federal court, this is not just something that the state must do, this is something that allows the individual to go into court and get enforcement,\" Justice Samuel Alito said of a statute's language.",
      "But Justice Elena Kagan warned that if the Supreme Court were to accept South Carolina's argument that a statute must include words such as right, privilege or entitlement in order to allow an individual to file a suit to enforce it, it is \"changing the rules midstream.\"",
      "Nicole Saharsky, who argued on behalf of Planned Parenthood, told the justices that South Carolina is trying to disqualify a provider from its Medicaid program for reasons that are unrelated to its medical qualifications. It has been established that the state violated Medicaid patients' ability to choose their own doctor, \"the only question is whether she can do something about it,\" she said.",
      "\"Congress expected that an individual would be able to sue in the rare instance when a state is keeping a needy patient away from a qualified and willing provider,\" Saharsky said. \"If the individual can't sue, this provision will be meaningless.\"",
      "The legal battle over Planned Parenthood's funding in South Carolina began in July 2018, when Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order directing the state's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services under Medicaid and terminate enrollment agreements.",
      "Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. But the state argued that because money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to abortion providers frees up other money to provide the procedure.",
      "The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services notified Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which has clinics in Charleston and Columbia, that its provider agreements were being cancelled because it was no longer qualified to provide services to Medicaid recipients.",
      "Planned Parenthood South Atlantic offers prenatal and postpartum services, as well as cancer screenings, physical exams and screenings for health conditions and cancer. But the state says that there are more than 140 other federally qualified health clinics and pregnancy centers across South Carolina who accept Medicaid and can provide services to low-income patients.",
      "Nearly 20% of South Carolina residents are insured through Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and 25% of its residents live in medically underserved areas.",
      "After Planned Parenthood was disqualified from participating in South Carolina's Medicaid program, Julie Edwards, a patient who received health services from the Planned Parenthood affiliate, and the organization filed a lawsuit challenging the state's termination decision.",
      "Edwards alleged in her lawsuit that the state's cancellation of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's agreement violated her right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act and asked a federal district court to issue an order allowing her and other patients to continue receiving care from Planned Parenthood.",
      "The district court sided with Edwards, finding that Medicaid patients can sue to obtain health care services from their preferred qualified and willing provider. The court also held that South Carolina likely violated the any-qualified provider requirement by terminating Planned Parenthood's participation in the state Medicaid program without cause.",
      "A federal appeals court on numerous different occasions concluded that Edwards' had a right to sue and blocked South Carolina from excluding Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The Supreme Court agreed in December to take up South Carolina's appeal.",
      "Defenders of South Carolina's move have argued that states are better suited to decide where to spend the Medicaid dollars they receive from the federal government, which they said leads to better treatment for low-income patients and their families.",
      "\"You've got roughly 200 publicly funded health care clinics in South Carolina that provide a broad range of high-quality health care services, including family-planning services,\" said John Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group. Bursch is arguing on behalf of South Carolina at the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued, \"South Carolina is entitled to decide that there are better options, and that's exactly what it's done.\"",
      "Bursch told the justices during oral arguments that Congress knows how to write legislation that clearly grants a private right that can be enforced through the courts, as it has done so in other statutes. But the provision at issue in the case involving Planned Parenthood doesn't use the word \"right\" or similar words like \"privilege\" or \"entitlement.\"",
      "\"If there is any ambiguity in this context, the state has to win because it's not put on notice of when it might be sued,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, putting states on clear notice requires explicit rights-creating language.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the goal is to provide clear guidance for courts to follow.",
      "\"I'm not allergic to magic words because magic words, if they represent the principle, will provide the clarity that will avoid the litigation that is a huge waste of resources for states, courts, providers, beneficiaries and Congress,\" he said.",
      "Several states have taken steps to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Texas, Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas. Two federal appeals courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, ruled that Medicaid patients do not have a right to sue over the state's decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from states' Medicaid programs.",
      "But several other appeals courts have blocked state efforts to cut off the organization from Medicaid dollars. If the Supreme Court rules for South Carolina, it would clear the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs.",
      "\"The reason why they would do that is pretty simple,\" Bursch said. \"Many Americans don't want their tax dollars propping up the abortion industry, especially when those dollars can be better spent on real health care.\"",
      "But Saharsky said that Congress' goal when writing the law was to stop states from excluding Medicaid providers from their programs arbitrarily, which she said South Carolina is doing with its effort to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving public health dollars. While Saharsky noted that a state would receive significant deference if it disqualified a provider from its Medicaid program because of questions of medical competence, she said that is not what is at issue in this case.",
      "\"It is only that there is something Planned Parenthood is doing outside of Medicaid that the state wants to disqualify it from the program,\" she said.",
      "Kagan warned that if states were allowed to provide their own justifications for terminating Medicaid provider agreements without the potential for recourse by patients, it would pave the way for states to \"split up the world by providers.\"",
      "\"That does not seem what this statute is all about, is allowing states to do that and then giving individuals no ability to come back and say, 'that's wrong. I'm entitled to see my provider of choice regardless of what they think about contraception or abortion or gender-transition treatment,'\" she said.",
      "Before the arguments, Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization, said at stake in the case is the ability of Medicaid beneficiaries to get the health care they need from the provider they know and trust.",
      "\"A loss in this case not only means that Medicaid patients in South Carolina would be unable to access Planned Parenthood, the ripple effect of that could mean that Medicaid patients across the country and particularly in states that might be inclined to want to restrict Medicaid recipients' ability to get care, it could affect all of those folks, and it fundamentally affects their ability to access really needed reproductive health care services that Planned Parenthood provides,\" she said.",
      "Friedrich-Karnik also said that a win for South Carolina would encourage the Trump administration to urge states to kick Planned Parenthood off state Medicaid plans.",
      "\"It emboldens the federal government, and it emboldens state governments who would like to restrict people's access in this way to do so,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration is backing South Carolina in the case and warned that a decision affirming the lower courts would invite a flood of litigation as beneficiaries seek to enforce other provisions of the Medicaid law and other statutes.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned what would flow from a ruling that allowed Medicaid recipients to bring lawsuits to enforce the any-provider provision.",
      "\"We're here because of Planned Parenthood not being a qualified provider in South Carolina, but would this open the floodgates of people bringing\" lawsuits because they can't see the provider of their choice, she asked Kyle Hawkins, counselor to the solicitor general, who argued for the federal government.",
      "Separately, Project 2025, the policy blueprint overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to limit Planned Parenthood's funding through Medicaid in part by issuing guidance reemphasizing that states can strip the group of its public dollars in state plans.",

      "At least nine students between the University of Colorado and Colorado State University have had their visas revoked by the Department of Homeland Security, spokespeople for the schools have said.",
      "The University of Colorado says four students and CSU says six students had their F-1 visas -- which allow international students to study at U.S. universities -- revoked. CU said this impacted students at its Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses, and the visas were revoked by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "It's not yet clear if any of the students whose visas were revoked in Colorado are accused of any crimes or why their visas were revoked.",
      "\"At CU we are focused on supporting the success of all of our students, including international students,\" a CU spokesperson told CBS News Colorado. \"Each one of our students are seeking to advance their careers and the lives of their families, and we understand the anxieties that visa revocations cause to impacted students. We urge any international student with questions or concerns to reach out to their campus' international student office.\"",
      "Both schools said they wouldn't identify the impacted students, citing privacy concerns.",
      "The Colorado School of Mines, Metropolitan State University, and the University of Denver said none of their students were impacted.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that 300 student visas have been revoked. Many, if not all, of those revocations were related to students who participated in\u00a0campus protests, despite questions about due process and First Amendment objections.",
      "\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said. \"If you lie to us and get a visa, then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa.\"",
      "Rubio continued that if a student then lost their visa, \"you're no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country.\"",
      "His comments come in response to questions about the high-profile arrests of students, including\u00a0Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk, and\u00a0Alireza Doroudi.",

      "The Republican administration on March 21 terminated a contract with the Acacia Center for Justice, which provides legal services for unaccompanied migrant children under 18 through a network of legal aid groups that subcontract with the center. Eleven subcontractor groups sued, saying 26,000 children were at risk of losing their attorneys. Acacia is not a plaintiff.",

On Friday, a federal judge in Boston said people with final deportation orders must have a \"meaningful opportunity\" to argue against being sent to a country other than their own. On Monday, another federal judge in San Francisco put on hold plans to end protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, including 350,000 whose legal status was scheduled to expire April 7.",

      "Acacia is under contract with the government to provide legal orientations, including \"know your rights\" clinics.",

      "Susan Crawford, who was endorsed by the Democratic Party, won the closely-watched Wisconsin Supreme Court race Tuesday night in what was the most expensive judicial election in American history.",
      "What would have normally been a sleepy nonpartisan judicial race turned into an expensive battle between Crawford, a Dane County judge, and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who was endorsed by the Republican Party. The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and other national political figures.",
      "With 91% of the vote in, Crawford led Schimel by 54% to 45%, a margin of about 184,000 votes.",
      "The race was seen by some as an early swing-state test of voter sentiment related to President Trump's performance in the White House, but also a crucial statewide race that could swing ideological control of Wisconsin's closely divided highest court.",
      "Going into the race, liberals held a 4-3 majority, and the court is expected to consider cases related to abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting and election rules.",
      "By Monday morning, 644,800 advance ballots had been returned, representing about a 40% increase over the advance total in Wisconsin's 2023 judicial race, and that year also set a turnout record. About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.",
      "Nineteen percent of advance ballots had come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.",
      "Given that the more liberal candidate won the 2023 race by double digits, the early turnout numbers looked good for Crawford. But the bulk of the voting occurred on Election Day.",
      "Musk, the world's wealthiest person and an ally to Mr. Trump, personally campaigned and spent big in an effort to sway voters toward Schimel, who both he and Mr. Trump have endorsed.",
      "That effort nearly collided with the justices currently seated on the state's Supreme Court, when Musk was sued over his promise to hand out $1 million to individual voters at a campaign event over the weekend.",
      "The court unanimously declined on Sunday to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Musk's checks from going out. At a rally soon after the decision, Musk handed two people oversized posters depicting $1 million checks, declaring that the money was payment in exchange for promises they'd be spokespeople for his political group.",

    "summary": "Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" was nominated for eight Oscars and grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its historical accuracy.",
    "story": [
      "Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film \"JFK\" portrayed President John F. Kennedy's assassination as the work of a shadowy government conspiracy, called Tuesday for a new congressional investigation of the killing during a hearing that aired conspiracy theories about it.",
      "The freewheeling hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, where partisan grievances were aired, followed last month's release of thousands of pages of government documents related to the assassination. The task force's Republican chair opened the proceedings by questioning the Warren Commission investigation's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Scholars say the files that President Donald Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy, and the declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on a review by CBS News. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.",
      "Stone's \"JFK\"\u00a0was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its historical accuracy. Stone told the committee that he believes decades of delays in releasing unredacted records had prevented \"clarity\" about who killed JFK.",
      "Stone also said a new investigation \"outside all political considerations\" should begin \"at the scene of the crime\" and reexamine all of the evidence from the day of the assassination. Scholars and historians have concluded that there's strong evidence that Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in killing Kennedy.",
      "\"Can we return to a world where we can trust our government to level with us, the people for which this government exists?\" Stone said. \"This is our democracy. This is our presidency. It belongs to us.\"",
      "The task force's chair, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, said she thinks the federal government under previous administrations had engaged in \"stonewalling.\"",
      "The task force also heard from a witness called by Democrats who criticized the Trump administration's handling of the recent JFK document release. John Davisson, senior counsel for the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, called it \"hurried\" and suggested that the National Archives and Records Administration \"simply ignored\" procedures for protecting people's privacy.",
      "The task force's Democrats followed up on his comments by criticizing the Trump administration over a variety of other issues.",
      "\"What I find funny about this hearing is that the Republicans are here relitigating whether CIA agents lied 60 years ago,\" said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whose Texas district includes part of Dallas.",
      "Crockett suggested that Congress should instead delve deeper into revelations that top national security officials discussed sensitive attack plans over a messaging app and mistakenly added a journalist to the group chat.",
      "The last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination took three years and ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy \"probably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.\" In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence \"to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.\"",
      "The Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.",
      "For Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0took executive action\u00a0to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The recently released documents about JFK's assassination have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found\u00a0here.",

Gaetz, who denied any wrongdoing, withdrew his name from consideration, although he had already resigned from Congress.",

      "Booker cited the legacy of leaders, like late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis, whom he said stood up \"when this country was facing crossroads, was facing crises, they stood up.\"",
      "\"I rise today in an unusual manner,\" Booker said, before invoking Lewis' refrain to \"get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.\"",
      "\"Tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble,\" Booker said at the outset, pledging to disrupt the normal business of the Senate. \"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis\u2026 These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\"",
      "More than 24 hours later, Booker was still speaking.",
      "The New Jersey Democrat spent some of that time reading letters from constituents who say they have been harmed by the Trump administration's policies, and condemning the administration more broadly \u2014 from trade wars to mass firings to deportations and threats to Medicaid.",
      "Booker occasionally yielded to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, as they echoed his concerns with the administration and encouraged his effort.",
      "Still, Booker was not permitted to leave the Senate floor without risking control and continuation of his speech. He later explained to reporters that he stopped eating on Friday and stopped drinking water a day before delivering the speech to prepare for the extended time without a bathroom break.",
      "After 7 a.m. Tuesday, Booker acknowledged the 12 hours that had passed, saying he was \"wide awake\" and would \"stand here for as many hours as I can.\" At noon, the Senate briefly paused for the chaplain to say a prayer, as is required under Senate rules during a continuous session. Booker continued to hold the floor.",
      "Asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse how he was doing after the 17-hour mark, Booker said, \"I shall not complain.\"",
      "About 23 hours in, he joked, \"I, first amongst us all, really love to speak.\"",
      "As he approached the record, Booker thanked Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut for standing by him during nearly the entirety of the speech, while recalling Murphy's filibuster in 2016.",
      "\"You stood, and I stood with you,\" Booker said. \"And he said to me days ago, 'if you're going to do this, brother, I will your aide-de-camp this time.'\"",
      "Murphy marked the historic moment, noting that the previous record was set when Thurmond was fighting against civil rights and making the case for \"why this nation should continue to segregate Black and White.\"",
      "\"What you have done here today Sen. Booker couldn't be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,\" Murphy said. \"Today you are standing in the way not of progress, but of retreat.\"",
      "At the 24-hour mark, Booker brought his message back to Lewis and the \"good trouble\" that he invoked on Monday.",
      "\"This is the moment, generations get them, we're at a crossroads here, folks,\" Booker said, minutes before the record-breaking moment.",
      "Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other House members came to the floor at various intervals to observe the Senator's speech in the rear of the chamber, including Reps. Steven Horsford, Maxine Waters, Jonathan Jackson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Sean Casten, Steve Cohen.",
      "Booker appeared to grow emotional as he surpassed Thurmond's record, saying he was not here because of Thurman's speech, but \"despite his speech.\"",
      "\"I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.\"",
      "What was the longest floor speech in Senate history?",
      "Prior to Booker's new record today, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina delivered the longest Senate speech on record, with a more than 24-hour filibuster in 1957. Thurmond carried out his filibuster in an effort to block civil rights legislation.",
      "Booker's marathon speech earlier eclipsed lengthy speeches delivered in recent years, including 21-hour filibuster by Sen. Ted Cruz in 2013 on Obamacare, and a 15-hour filibuster by Murphy on gun control.",

      "Employees across the massive U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began receiving notices of dismissal on Tuesday in a major overhaul expected to ultimately lay off up to 10,000 people. The notices come just days after President Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government.",

      "The plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers across the country under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "As CBS News reported last week, the layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff \u2014 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers. That's down from around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records. There were 81,917 at the end of the first Trump administration.",

      "\"They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,\" Murray said Friday during a call with reporters.",

      "Union representatives for HHS employees received a notice Thursday that between 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated.

    "summary": "Top ICE official calls removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on deportation flight that sent him to a supermax prison in El Salvador an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\" resulted in a Salvadoran man's deportation and imprisonment in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a legal order prohibiting his removal there.",
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. on March 15 as part of a series of deportation flights that sent hundreds of alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had granted him a legal protection from deportation.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a court battle between the Justice Department and U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked further deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights transported 238 Venezuelas and 23 Salvadorans, all of whom Trump administration officials described as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Lawyers and relatives of many of the Venezuelans have strongly denied claims that their clients and loved ones are gang members.",
      "The filings were made as part of a suit filed by attorneys for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man and Maryland resident who received a legal status known as \"withholding of removal\" in 2019 after an immigration judge found that Abrego Garcia, who left his native country in 2011 at age 16, could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. His case was first reported by The Atlantic late Monday.",
      "Although the Trump administration concedes it made a mistake when it deported Abrego Garcia, it is opposing a request for him to be brought back to the U.S. The government has argued Abrego Garcia is a danger to the community, alleging that he's a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "The Justice Department has also argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosheberg called the Trump administration's refusal to try to get his client back \"appalling.\"",
      "\"I've had wrongful deportation cases before, including in the last Trump administration and in every single such case, as soon as they realize what they've done, they bent over backwards,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland, alongside his wife and their disabled 5-year-old son, both of whom are U.S. citizens, according to the court filings submitted by his lawyers. Before he was arrested by ICE last month, Abrego Garcia was routinely attending check-ins with the agency, the filings said. His lawyers said he has no criminal record in the U.S., a finding the government has not disputed.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was standing outside of a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, soliciting work with three other men when he was arrested. His attorney said he was questioned about whether he was a gang member, and when he told police he was not, the police said they didn't believe him and said they were calling ICE.",
      "During immigration proceedings, Abrego Garcia's attorneys said the only evidence the government provided in support of his gang affiliation was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and that a confidential informant said he was an active MS-13 member in a branch of the gang that operates on Long Island, New York, where Abrego Garcia's attorneys say he has never lived.",
      "\"He's not a gang member. The allegations against him are based on whispers and shadows,\" Sandoval-Mosheberg said.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in their initial complaint\u00a0that their client's name was not included in a Hyattsville City Police Department report about the Home Depot arrest, and said that the detective who authored the gang affiliation part of the report had been suspended.",
      "An immigration judge ruled that the informant's testimony was \"proven and reliable,\" but said that he should not be deported to El Salvador.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Abrego Garcia is \"a member of the brutal MS-13 gang and was reportedly involved in human trafficking. Whether he be in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S. he should be locked up.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance responded to media reports about the deportation on Tuesday, posting on X that \"It is telling that the entire American media is going to run a propaganda operation today making you think an innocent 'father of 3' was apprehended by a gulag,\" adding that Abrego Garcia \"is an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:56 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",

      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.",
      "The Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.",
      "During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"",
      "Jennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.",
      "\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.",
      "Jennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.",
      "On March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.",
      "Over the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.",
      "Jennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.",
      "\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"",
      "Jennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.",
      "While it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department has argued\u00a0that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.",
      "Jennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.",

      "In his ruling to dismiss the case with prejudice, Judge Ho took issue with the Department of Justice's request to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning he could've faced trial on the same charges again at a later time.",
      "Judge Ho summarized the DOJ's reasoning to drop the case as based on three things: It's tainted with impropriety, detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement, and was a weak case to begin with.",
      "\"There  may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ, if  taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging  like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"And there are many reasons to be troubled by DOJ's proffered rationales\u2014further supporting dismissal with prejudice.\"",
      "Judge Ho also addressed why he couldn't continue to pursue the case after the DOJ moved to dismiss it.",
      "\"Some will undoubtedly find today's decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the  Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue  the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that  would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"Therefore, any  decision by this Court to deny the Government's Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because  DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case,  inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor's right to a speedy  trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the  June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\"",
      "\"To be clear, the Court again emphasizes that it does not express any opinion as to the merits  of the case or whether the prosecution of Mayor Adams 'should' move forward,\" Judge Ho added.",
      "Read the judge's order in full",
      "Read the judge's order in full",
      "\"Legally speaking, he is innocent until proven guilty, and he will never be proven guilty - that is an unequivocal, it is rare when we can rarely say things that definitively - but he will never face legal consequences for the allegations that were against him in this case,\" Hofstra Law Professor James Sample said.",
      "Impact on the mayor's race",
      "The timing of the decision to drop the case is critical for Adams, who is facing a Thursday midnight deadline to file petitions to run for mayor in New York City's Democratic primary.",
      "The decision means Adams is now free to run without the threat of going to jail, or facing a politically damaging trial.",
      "CBS News New York has learned that Adams is immediately jumping into the political fray, and he plans to participate in a mayoral candidates forum sponsored by the National Action Network Thursday.",
      "\"He looks forward to engaging with fellow candidates and community leaders to discuss the future of our great city,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Since there's no possibility of the charges against him resurfacing, Adams can also say he is not beholden to President Trump or his administration, since they can no longer bring the same case against him. Adams has repeatedly said that, and just Tuesday night, New York City joined a suit against the Trump administration to challenge cuts that would cost New York City $100 million in CDC funding.",
      "\"When federal policies directly impact our city, we have been, and will continue to be, the first and loudest to advocate for New Yorkers. These funds are crucial in protecting public health, and the reversal will have serious consequences for communities across the five boroughs,\" Adams said in his statement Tuesday night.",
      "Even before Adams officially learned that his case had been dropped, Adams made it clear at a National Action Network event Wednesday that suggestions he was \"under the finger\" of President Trump were, in his mind, false.",
      "\"I do not know who you think I'm under the finger of,\" Adams said Wednesday morning. \"But I'm on the finger of Eric Adams, the mayor of the city of New York, and I'm going to continue to do so.\"",
      "Adams also made an argument voters can expect to hear if he seeks another term.",
      "\"I'm the same person that made sure we put $17 billion in the [minority and women-owned businesses] in this city, that invested in foster care children, that built more housing in year one and year two of our administration than in the history of this city,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams has not made clear how he intends to run for re-election - as a Democrat, independent, or perhaps even as a Republican.",
      "Adams has previously told CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer to expect twists and turns in the upcoming mayoral election.",
      "Adams' opposition speaks out",
      "The mayor's detractors were also speaking out.",
      "\"Either way, I think there was tremendous damage that was done to this city because of an Adams administration, so the quickest we can get away from this administration, I think the better for the city,\" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.",
      "\"It's absolutely disgusting. You have a man that broke the law. We want to remind people that it wasn't just about flight upgrades. This was a man who illegally held a campaign donor scheme, and the fact that the judge unfortunately bowed to Trump is appalling,\" mayoral candidate Michael Blake said.",
      "\"The ruling does not change the facts: Eric Adams works for Donald Trump, not New Yorkers,\" mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said.",
      "\"Eric Adams has sold out New Yorkers and put himself above the public at every chance he could. Even the judge in the case agrees: this slimy deal reeks of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration. In exchange for his freedom, Adams has looked the other way while the federal government detains and disappears New Yorkers, steals money from our city, and wages war on working people. Adams should resign in disgrace,\" mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said.",
      "Move to drop charges sparked resignations",
      "The DOJ memo seeking to drop the charges set off a spate of resignations that started in City Hall, at the very heart of Adams' inner circle, and reached all the way to the U.S. attorney's office. At issue was then-Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon's allegation that the request to dismiss the case amounted to a quid pro quo, namely Adams' cooperation on President Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for his charges being dropped. Sassoon resigned, rather than drop the charges, as did several other people in the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "The mayor and his attorney pushed back strenuously against the notion of a quid pro quo.",
      "\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney \u00a0Alex Spiro said.",
      "Allegations that Adams had been compromised by the Trump administration and was operating, essentially, under its thumb led\u00a0four New York City deputy mayors to resign\u00a0and spurred numerous calls for Adams to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, then met with key leaders to discuss his future. She ultimately acted to limit Adams' powers in a bid to restore trust in government, but said she wouldn't remove him.",
      "What Adams has been accused of",
      "Last September, federal prosecutors alleged Adams had been abusing his power for almost a decade. They said he solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In the\u00a057-page indictment, Adams was accused of receiving gifts he didn't disclose, including luxury travel, worth more than $100,000, in return for political favors.",
      "\"These upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or loyalty program available to the general public. As we allege, this was a multi-year scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" then-U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District Damian Williams\u00a0said as he announced the indictment.",
      "Prosecutors accused Adams of pressuring FDNY officials to approve the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan, despite fire safety concerns.",
      "The Adams campaign was also accused of using \"straw donors\" for illicit contributions, enabling it to tap into $10 million in matching funds.",
      "\"These are bright red lines, and we allege that the mayor crossed them again and again for years,\" Williams said.",
      "Before the DOJ stepped in, prosecutors appeared to be ramping up their case, claiming they had uncovered\u00a0\"additional criminal conduct.\"",
      "Adams associates also under investigation",
      "The historic indictment came amid\u00a0multiple investigations into Adams' campaign, as well as other administration officials.",
      "Numerous top members of the Adams administration resigned before the indictment was announced, including former\u00a0NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban\u00a0and\u00a0his twin brother, James Caban. Former\u00a0Schools Chancellor David Banks\u00a0and his wife, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and his brother, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III, were also investigated.",
      "Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a longtime Adams advisor, pleaded not guilty to bribery, money laundering and conspiracy\u00a0in a case involving her son and two real estate developers. The mayor's former liaison for the Muslim community, Mohamed Bahi, was also\u00a0charged with conspiracy for his role in collecting illegal donations\u00a0for Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and\u00a0has agreed to plead guilty, according to court documents.",

    "summary": "A unique talent, Val Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable.",
    "story": [
      "Val Kilmer, the acclaimed, brooding actor who starred in a string of blockbuster hits in the 1980s and 1990s, has died at the age of 65.",
      "Kilmer died Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, his daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Val Kilmer died from pneumonia. He had recovered after a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required two tracheotomies.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Kilmer's death.",
      "A unique talent, Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable. Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",
      "His last major film credit was in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which he reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.",
      "Toward the end of \"Val,\" the 2021 documentary on his career, Kilmer said, \"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",
      "His movie career hit its zenith in the early 1990s as he made a name for himself as a dashing leading man, starring alongside Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton in \"Tombstone,\" as Elvis' ghost in \"True Romance\" and as a bank-robbing demolition expert in Mann's film \"Heat\" with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir. He agreed after being promised that his role would improve from the initial script.",
      "Kilmer vs. the Batman costume",
      "One career nadir when he played Batman in Joel Schumacher's goofy, garish \"Batman Forever\" with Nicole Kidman and opposite Chris O'Donnell's Robin - before George Clooney took up the mantle for 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" and after Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight in 1989's \"Batman\" and 1992's \"Batman Returns.\"",
      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",
      "He dated Cher and married and divorced actor Joanne Whalley.",

      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",

      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate approved a measure Wednesday aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked President Trump.",
      "In a 51 to 48 vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. But the House is unlikely to take up the resolution, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "Joining Democrats in support of the measure were Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and former GOP leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, would terminate the national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Kaine forced the vote under the National Emergencies Act, bypassing Senate Republican leadership.",
      "The president first threatened the tariffs on Canada and Mexico in January, touting a need to enhance border security and stop the flow of fentanyl over the nation's borders, before they were twice delayed.",
      "Kaine, who called the tariffs \"attacks on everyday people,\" said ahead of the vote that the president has justified the imposition of these tariffs on \"a made up emergency.\" He argued that while fentanyl is a \"real emergency,\" it's not from Canada, while warning that the Canadian tariffs will tax groceries and food products, building supplies, fertilizers, along with materials that produce ships and submarines and implicate U.S. national security.",
      "With 47 Democrats and independents in the chamber, the resolution required the support of at least four Republicans for approval. Mr. Trump put pressure on the GOP leading up to the vote, urging that \"Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge.\"",
      "\"Don't let the Democrats have a Victory,\" the president said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday. \"It would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States.\"",
      "Ahead of the vote, the president called out the Republican senators who supported the measure, saying in a post in the wee hours Wednesday that \"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change.\"",
      "\"The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve,\" Mr. Trump continued, asking the senators' constituents to reach out to them.",

      "Thune criticized the measure ahead of the vote, warning that it could threaten efforts to stop fentanyl from entering the country.",

    "summary": "President Trump rolled out new tariffs on April 2 aimed at easing trade imbalances. Here's which products could become more expensive as a result.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S.,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "Automobiles",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's previously announced 25% tariff on auto imports, which go into effect today, imported autos will also face the 10% universal tariffs. Some U.S.-made vehicles include parts imported from other countries, which will face new tariffs and increase the purchase price of those cars, experts said.",
      "Ultimately, American consumers could end up paying an additional $2,500 to $5,000 for the lowest-cost American cars, and up to $20,000 for some imported models, according to an April 2 estimate from Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Clothing and shoes",
      "The bulk of apparel and shoes sold in U.S. stores like Walmart and Target is manufactured outside the U.S., with China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among the biggest exporters.",
      "All three nations will face reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration, at 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam and 37% for Bangladesh.",
      "Wine and spirits",
      "Italian and French wines and Scottish whisky are also likely to rise in price, as European Union imports will face a reciprocal tariff of 20% while United Kingdom-made products will face a 10% import duty.",
      "Furniture",
      "About 30% to 40% of furniture sold in the U.S. is manufactured in other countries, according to CNBC. Top exporters of furniture to the U.S. include China and Vietnam.",
      "Coffee and chocolate",
      "The U.S. imports about 80% of its coffee beans from Latin American countries such as Brazil and Colombia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Both nations are included in Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, with each facing rates of 10%.",
      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans. Among the nations that export cocoa beans to the country are Cote d'Ivoire and Ecuador, according to the USDA. Those nations will face reciprocal tariffs of 21% and 10%, respectively.",
      "Swiss watches",
      "Swiss imports to the U.S. will face a new reciprocal tariff of 31%, which will impact watches from affordable brands such as Swatch to pricey timepieces manufactured by the likes of Rolex.",

      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 18:35:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has targeted international students in wake of pro-Palestinian protests and other activities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's crackdown on students who participated in pro-Palestinian activities has raised questions about the First Amendment rights of visa and green card holders amid the shocking detentions of a number of students at Tufts, Columbia and other universities in recent weeks.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the nation's top diplomat to revoke the visas of foreign national students on the grounds that their presence or activities have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.",
      "The federal government is not required to lay out proof beyond that explanation, legal experts told CBS News, setting up a legal showdown over foreign nationals' free speech rights in the U.S.",
      "\"There's a tension between everyone's First Amendment rights to free speech and the immigration statute's broad provisions giving the secretary of state broad latitude to declare someone deportable simply because he thinks that the student may have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. And the courts will have to figure out where the appropriate line should be drawn,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University.",
      "Rubio said Thursday the State Department has canceled more than 300 visas and that they're \"primarily\" student visas. Several high-profile cases are related to students who led or participated in pro-Palestinian activities and disruptive protests, which the administration has equated to activity supporting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",
      "He also told reporters that if the administration is compelled to provide evidence in court, it will, but said \"judges don't issue student visas. There's no right to a student visa.\"",
      "\"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we've given you a visa, and then you decide to do that, we're going to take it away,\" Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.",
      "In targeting students, the Trump administration is enforcing the statute differently than past administrations, according to immigration lawyer Jonathan Grode.",
      "\"This administration hasn't changed the law,\" Grode said. \"They're just telling the referees to call the game differently. They're saying, be stricter, use all the tools you have available to effectuate this behavior. That's the big difference. That's why it feels so jarring.\"",
      "\"With the Trump administration, they're pushing this to such a degree that it's creating concern, hysteria, reaction, litigation,\" he added.",
      "A visa revocation does not automatically result in a person's deportation, which is handled by the Department of Homeland Security and requires due process. Several of the students are sitting in detention facilities as the government seeks to deport them.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wearing masks and in plain clothes in Massachusetts on Tuesday, March 25.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Wednesday that Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk's friends have said she is being punished for co-authoring an opinion piece in the Tufts Daily campus newspaper in 2024, where she called on the school to divest from Israel and \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" but never mentioned Hamas.",
      "Tufts University said in a statement April 2 that the op-ed was consistent with the university's policy on freedom of expression, and that it has \"no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "\"The University has seen an outpouring of support for Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty and staff. These individuals have described Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits and committed to her colleagues,\" Tufts said.",
      "The case followed another high-profile detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University grad student who had been active in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last year. Khalil, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, has a green card, or legal permanent residency, and his wife is an American citizen. Immigration authorities initially told Khalil that they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that he had a green card, the agent said they were revoking that according to his attorney.",
      "Green cards, however, cannot be rescinded as simply as visas. The government suggested in a court filing earlier this week that it could move to revoke his status for allegedly omitting information on his immigration forms, including his involvement with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "But at the core of the U.S. government's detention and aimed deportation of Khalil is a rarely used section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that subjects noncitizens to possible deportation if their presence and activities are deemed threatening to the foreign policy interests of the U.S.",
      "This same law was used to detain Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national who was taken into custody by masked agents March 17 in Virginia. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "The government using that law is also trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Chung came to the U.S. from South Korea with her family when she was 7.",
      "Yale-Loehr recalled two other cases where similar powers were invoked in deportation proceedings. In 1987, it was used in a case involving eight people who either held valid student visas or were lawful permanent residents for their pro-Palestinian activism. The deportation case dragged on for 20 years and ended with a judge calling the government's actions \"an embarrassment to the rule of law.\" In the 1990s, the government tried to deport a former Mexican official who was in the U.S. on a visa and faced charges in his home country. The then secretary of state said his deportation was necessary for foreign policy matters.",
      "Attorneys in the recent cases have accused the Trump administration of using immigration enforcement to suppress speech it disagrees with.",
      "Grode said the crackdown could have a chilling effect on the First Amendment. The Trump administration, which ran on a free speech platform, is \"creeping in on attacking some of the very fundamental principles that make America America,\" he said. Still, noncitizens having First Amendment rights \"doesn't negate the ability of the government to revoke their visa,\" he added.",
      "Yale-Loehr expects it will take years for these cases to be settled, predicting that \"it's going to be a mess.\"",
      "\"If there's over 300 students who had their visas revoked, there's going to be a lot of cases challenging it,\" he said. \"I suspect that the litigation will take years to unravel before a court and get a definitive ruling on the extent to which foreign nationals have First Amendment rights.\"",

      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"horrendous\" trade imbalances have hurt the U.S. and put national security at risk, placing blame on previous U.S. presidents and administrations.",
      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",
      "Here are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:",
      "China \u2014 34%\u00a0European Union \u2014 20%Taiwan \u2014 32%South Korea \u2014 25%India \u2014 26%Israel \u2014 17%\u00a0Nicaragua \u2014 18%Norway \u2014 15%Jordan \u2014 20%",

      "Nicaragua \u2014 18%",
      "Norway \u2014 15%",
      "Jordan \u2014 20%",
      "Countries that will see only the baseline 10% tariff rates include: Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the United Kingdom.",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S. The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",
      "\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs today on a number of other countries. Here's what to know about these import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Other experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.",
      "For example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, thinks likely targets include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Are reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "For now, it remains unclear what reciprocal tariff rates the U.S. might charge, although UBS analysts note that the levies imposed during Mr. Trump's first term were smaller and mostly targeted China.",
      "More certain is that reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, experts say, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans unveiled a budget resolution on Wednesday, as the GOP seeks to move forward with the budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda later this week.",
      "The Senate Budget committee released the 70-page budget resolution on Wednesday, which would serve as a blueprint, directing congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. The plan is a key step toward implementing the president's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes. It aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, along with authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The blueprint is a compromise resolution that comes after a key meeting between Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and top tax leaders last week. Though House and Senate Republicans had previously forged ahead with their own budget blueprints in recent weeks, the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to continue on in the reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,\" Thune said in a statement as the resolution was released.",
      "Thune said the budget resolution will \"pave the way for a generational investment in border security and national defense and unleash American energy dominance,\" while demonstrating a commitment to \"reducing the size and scope of the federal government by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.\"",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "The Senate majority leader outlined to reporters earlier Wednesday that he plans to file the resolution on the floor after its release, which would start a clock of up to 50 hours of debate and set up a late week vote-a-rama, where senators are allowed to introduce an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to vote through the night. The timeline could set the House on a path to adopt the changes to the budget resolution next week, delivering a key win for President Trump and congressional Republicans before lawmakers leave town for Easter recess.",
      "The budget resolution's release comes as the majority leader and Senate Budget Committee Republicans met with President Trump earlier Wednesday at the White House, where Thune said committee members aired their views with the president.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the meeting that the members made the point that their priorities are to extend the Trump tax cuts, to further refine the tax code to encourage growth and extend the debt limit while reducing spending. And he noted that the meeting allayed some of the concerns of budget hawks.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said after the meeting that feels \"a lot more comfortable\" with the budget resolution, saying \"there's just a real commitment to returning the federal budget to a reasonable pre-pandemic baseline.\"",
      "The development also comes as Senate Republicans opted to proceed without the Senate parliamentarian's sign off, arguing in recent days that they don't need the parliamentarian's permission to move ahead with the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing.",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Kennedy reiterated the widely held GOP position Wednesday that \"we don't need the parliamentarian's permission,\" arguing that the Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, has the authority to make that decision on the current policy baseline. He projected that Senate Democrats will challenge it, but \"they'll lose.\"",
      "Graham said in a statement upon the resolution's release that \"I have determined that current policy will be the budget baseline regarding taxation.\"",
      "\"This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent \u2013 which will tremendously boost the economy,\" he added.",

      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/takeaways-wisconsin-florida-elections/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:57:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Here are the takeaways from a liberal's victory in Wisconsin and GOP wins in Florida races to succeed Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz in Tuesday's elections.",
    "story": [
      "A closely watched election for a state supreme court judgeship in Wisconsin gave Democrats a boost Tuesday night, while two special elections in Florida delivered two seats to House Speaker Mike Johnson's perilously thin GOP majority. Though off-year and special elections attract a much smaller share of voters than presidential elections, the outcomes in both states held insights for Democrats and Republicans for the months ahead. Here are some of the takeaways:",
      "Wisconsin State Supreme Court race",
      "A setback for Trump and Musk",
      "Despite heavy financial backing from Elon Musk and groups tied to him \u2014 over $20 million \u2014 and an endorsement by President Trump, conservative candidate Brad Schimel lost by a 10-point margin to Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race. Musk's infusion of millions failed to sway Wisconsin voters in this statewide judicial race, marking a notable political defeat in a battleground state that Trump narrowly flipped in 2024.",
      "Crawford ran primarily against Musk's involvement in the state \u2014 and national Democrats could convert this win into an early game plan heading into the gubernatorial races later this year, and the 2026 midterms.",
      "Record-breaking spending of over $90 million",
      "The race became the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, with total spending exceeding $90 million and by some projections, reaching $100 million. This unprecedented influx of money \u2014 fueled by big-dollar donors on both sides of the race including Elon Musk, George Soros, JB Pritzker and others, underscores the growing nationalization and politicization of state judicial races and raises questions about the influence of outside interests on local races.",
      "In the battle of the billionaire donors waged in this judicial race, there was no bigger loser than Musk, who donated $3 million to the state GOP and groups associated with him spent more than $20 million. The efforts of the world's richest man also galvanized Democratic voters in Wisconsin to cast their ballot for Crawford according to Wisconsin Democrats.",
      "What Tuesday could mean for Musk's future political spending",
      "It will be worth watching how much the outcome impacts the way Musk invests his financial and political capital between now and the 2026 midterms, given the loss he sustained in the Wisconsin race.",
      "With Musk's help, Republicans won the White House and Senate in the 2024 election, while also maintaining control of the House. In the 2026 midterms, however, the GOP faces challenges in its quest to hold onto and build on its narrow House majority. The interest in Tuesday's race not just from voters, but also major Democratic donors, suggests a large influx of cash is likely to be invested in both sides at a time when the president's party is at risk of heavy losses amid pushback by voters.",
      "High voter engagement",
      "Turnout was exceptionally high for a spring election and a judicial race, potentially surpassing 2.4 million voters, far exceeding the 2023 state supreme court race, according to CBS News estimates. This surge, coupled with Crawford's strong performance in key areas like Dane County, indicates a strong mobilization among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, driven by concern about the policies of the new Trump administration and opposition to Musk's involvement.",
      "It also suggests broader interest from the Wisconsin electorate about judicial independence on issues like abortion rights and congressional redistricting.",
      "Liberal majority on Wisconsin State Supreme Court retained",
      "Crawford's victory ensured that the Wisconsin Supreme Court maintained its 4-3 liberal majority. This outcome preserves the ideological balance of the state's highest court that has been in place since 2023.\u00a0 This has already led to significant rulings favoring progressive priorities, such as striking down Republican-drawn legislative maps and addressing voting rights issues.",
      "A boost for Democrats",
      "In speaking with national Democrats after the Wisconsin election results, they say that the win has boosted Democrats nationally as they contend with intraparty squabbling on the direction of the party going into the 2026 midterms. With the Badger State race as a referendum on Musk and Trump policies, the outcome of Tuesday's election could also serve as a cautionary tale for Republicans as they prepare for the 2025 gubernatorial races and 2026. To many they saw it as a referendum on voter enthusiasm.",
      "Trump touts voter ID win",
      "Despite Schimel's loss, President Trump posted on social media to highlight one win for conservatives: Wisconsin voters approved a measure to enshrine the state's voter ID requirement in the state constitution. The law, which already mandates showing a photo ID at the polls, now holds the added weight of a constitutional amendment.",
      "Florida special congressional elections",
      "Republican victories with narrower margins",
      "Republicans Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine won the 1st and 6th Districts in Florida Tuesday, respectively, maintaining GOP control of the deep-red seats vacated by Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz. Their victories came with dramatically reduced margins compared to the 2024 general election a few months ago, however. Patronis defeated Gay Valimonti 57-42%, a 15-point margin, and Fine also won his race against Democrat Josh Weil with a 57-42% victory, a sharp drop from Waltz's 33-point victory in November.",
      "Democratic over-performance in fundraising",
      "Democrats outperformed expectations in two deep-red Florida districts on Tuesday, fueled by massive fundraising hauls that far surpassed their Republican opponents. Weil raised more than $9 million, while Valimont brought in roughly $6 million \u2014 numbers that helped make the races far more competitive than anticipated. Republicans held both seats, but with notably closer margins, underscoring the GOP's entrenched advantage in these Trump strongholds.",
      "Still, the Democratic contenders notched a symbolic victory when Valimont carried Escambia County \u2014 a longtime GOP stronghold in presidential elections \u2014 a rare blue dot in the ruby-red district.",
      "Trump's influence tested but intact",
      "Both Patronis and Fine benefited from Mr. Trump's endorsements and late campaign efforts, including tele-town halls and Truth Social posts, which helped secure their wins. Yet the closer-than-expected races, despite the president's personal involvement and his own overwhelming victories in these districts\u00a0 \u2014 68% in the 1st District and 65% in the 6th \u2014 hint at potential political vulnerabilities in his influence early in his second term, especially when Mr. Trump is not on the ballot. The results bolstered the GOP's slim House majority, now 220-213, but the tighter margins signal that Mr. Trump's sway may not be as absolute in off-cycle elections.",
      "Special elections for House remain a challenge for the opposing party",
      "Tuesday's results in Florida line up with CBS News' political unit's analysis this week that since Mr. Trump was first elected president in 2017, a seat has flipped in House special elections less than 15% of the time.",
      "Hunter Woodall\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:20:42 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped\u00a0after he was elected to a second term.",
      "Amid the president's targeting of some of the nation's most prominent firms, a split has begun to emerge among the legal community between those subject to punishment by Mr. Trump and a growing number that are entering into deals with the president.",
      "Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments, he announced last week. Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "On Wednesday, the president said on social media that the firm Milbank LLP committed to performing at least $100 million in free legal work during the Trump administration and after on initiatives backed by the president and firm, and also made a series of other commitments.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",
      "\"Sometimes the times call for courage,\" Olson said. \"Are you recognizing that this is one of those times that the ordinary calculations aren't good enough, the calculations that would do against many ordinary sorts of danger? This is an extraordinary danger. Maybe it calls for extraordinary courage.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:06:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolinas-attempt-to-strip-planned-parenthood-of-medicaid-funding-faces-supreme-court/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:50:36 -0400",
    "summary": "South Carolina in 2018 moved to terminate a Planned Parenthood affiliate's participation in its state Medicaid program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court weighed Wednesday a yearslong court fight over South Carolina's attempt to boot Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program and whether beneficiaries can sue to enforce their ability to see their preferred health care provider.",
      "South Carolina moved to withhold Medicaid funds from a Planned Parenthood affiliate in 2018, four years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left the issue of abortion policy to the states. But since that then, the landscape for abortion care has shifted drastically, with a\u00a0dozen states\u00a0enacting near-total bans on abortion and another four states, including South Carolina, outlawing the procedure after six weeks gestation.",
      "While Planned Parenthood provides abortion services outside of Medicaid as allowed under state laws, anti-abortion rights groups and lawmakers at the state and federal levels have long been working to keep public health dollars away from the group. Its clinics also offer contraception, pregnancy testing, gender-affirming care and screenings for cancer and conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.",
      "The question in the case is a technical one: whether Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that allows them to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing. But if South Carolina prevails in the dispute, it could pave the way for more states to defund Planned Parenthood through their state Medicaid plans.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, appeared divided over whether Medicaid recipients can sue under a federal civil rights law to enforce the provision, known as the any-qualified provider requirement.",
      "\"We need something that's out of the ordinary that signals to the federal court, this is not just something that the state must do, this is something that allows the individual to go into court and get enforcement,\" Justice Samuel Alito said of a statute's language.",
      "But Justice Elena Kagan warned that if the Supreme Court were to accept South Carolina's argument that a statute must include words such as right, privilege or entitlement in order to allow an individual to file a suit to enforce it, it is \"changing the rules midstream.\"",
      "Nicole Saharsky, who argued on behalf of Planned Parenthood, told the justices that South Carolina is trying to disqualify a provider from its Medicaid program for reasons that are unrelated to its medical qualifications. It has been established that the state violated Medicaid patients' ability to choose their own doctor, \"the only question is whether she can do something about it,\" she said.",
      "\"Congress expected that an individual would be able to sue in the rare instance when a state is keeping a needy patient away from a qualified and willing provider,\" Saharsky said. \"If the individual can't sue, this provision will be meaningless.\"",
      "The legal battle over Planned Parenthood's funding in South Carolina began in July 2018, when Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order directing the state's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services under Medicaid and terminate enrollment agreements.",
      "Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. But the state argued that because money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to abortion providers frees up other money to provide the procedure.",
      "The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services notified Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which has clinics in Charleston and Columbia, that its provider agreements were being cancelled because it was no longer qualified to provide services to Medicaid recipients.",
      "Planned Parenthood South Atlantic offers prenatal and postpartum services, as well as cancer screenings, physical exams and screenings for health conditions and cancer. But the state says that there are more than 140 other federally qualified health clinics and pregnancy centers across South Carolina who accept Medicaid and can provide services to low-income patients.",
      "Nearly 20% of South Carolina residents are insured through Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and 25% of its residents live in medically underserved areas.",
      "After Planned Parenthood was disqualified from participating in South Carolina's Medicaid program, Julie Edwards, a patient who received health services from the Planned Parenthood affiliate, and the organization filed a lawsuit challenging the state's termination decision.",
      "Edwards alleged in her lawsuit that the state's cancellation of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's agreement violated her right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act and asked a federal district court to issue an order allowing her and other patients to continue receiving care from Planned Parenthood.",
      "The district court sided with Edwards, finding that Medicaid patients can sue to obtain health care services from their preferred qualified and willing provider. The court also held that South Carolina likely violated the any-qualified provider requirement by terminating Planned Parenthood's participation in the state Medicaid program without cause.",
      "A federal appeals court on numerous different occasions concluded that Edwards' had a right to sue and blocked South Carolina from excluding Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The Supreme Court agreed in December to take up South Carolina's appeal.",
      "Defenders of South Carolina's move have argued that states are better suited to decide where to spend the Medicaid dollars they receive from the federal government, which they said leads to better treatment for low-income patients and their families.",
      "\"You've got roughly 200 publicly funded health care clinics in South Carolina that provide a broad range of high-quality health care services, including family-planning services,\" said John Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group. Bursch is arguing on behalf of South Carolina at the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued, \"South Carolina is entitled to decide that there are better options, and that's exactly what it's done.\"",
      "Bursch told the justices during oral arguments that Congress knows how to write legislation that clearly grants a private right that can be enforced through the courts, as it has done so in other statutes. But the provision at issue in the case involving Planned Parenthood doesn't use the word \"right\" or similar words like \"privilege\" or \"entitlement.\"",
      "\"If there is any ambiguity in this context, the state has to win because it's not put on notice of when it might be sued,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, putting states on clear notice requires explicit rights-creating language.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the goal is to provide clear guidance for courts to follow.",
      "\"I'm not allergic to magic words because magic words, if they represent the principle, will provide the clarity that will avoid the litigation that is a huge waste of resources for states, courts, providers, beneficiaries and Congress,\" he said.",
      "Several states have taken steps to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Texas, Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas. Two federal appeals courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, ruled that Medicaid patients do not have a right to sue over the state's decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from states' Medicaid programs.",
      "But several other appeals courts have blocked state efforts to cut off the organization from Medicaid dollars. If the Supreme Court rules for South Carolina, it would clear the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs.",
      "\"The reason why they would do that is pretty simple,\" Bursch said. \"Many Americans don't want their tax dollars propping up the abortion industry, especially when those dollars can be better spent on real health care.\"",
      "But Saharsky said that Congress' goal when writing the law was to stop states from excluding Medicaid providers from their programs arbitrarily, which she said South Carolina is doing with its effort to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving public health dollars. While Saharsky noted that a state would receive significant deference if it disqualified a provider from its Medicaid program because of questions of medical competence, she said that is not what is at issue in this case.",
      "\"It is only that there is something Planned Parenthood is doing outside of Medicaid that the state wants to disqualify it from the program,\" she said.",
      "Kagan warned that if states were allowed to provide their own justifications for terminating Medicaid provider agreements without the potential for recourse by patients, it would pave the way for states to \"split up the world by providers.\"",
      "\"That does not seem what this statute is all about, is allowing states to do that and then giving individuals no ability to come back and say, 'that's wrong. I'm entitled to see my provider of choice regardless of what they think about contraception or abortion or gender-transition treatment,'\" she said.",
      "Before the arguments, Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization, said at stake in the case is the ability of Medicaid beneficiaries to get the health care they need from the provider they know and trust.",
      "\"A loss in this case not only means that Medicaid patients in South Carolina would be unable to access Planned Parenthood, the ripple effect of that could mean that Medicaid patients across the country and particularly in states that might be inclined to want to restrict Medicaid recipients' ability to get care, it could affect all of those folks, and it fundamentally affects their ability to access really needed reproductive health care services that Planned Parenthood provides,\" she said.",
      "Friedrich-Karnik also said that a win for South Carolina would encourage the Trump administration to urge states to kick Planned Parenthood off state Medicaid plans.",
      "\"It emboldens the federal government, and it emboldens state governments who would like to restrict people's access in this way to do so,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration is backing South Carolina in the case and warned that a decision affirming the lower courts would invite a flood of litigation as beneficiaries seek to enforce other provisions of the Medicaid law and other statutes.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned what would flow from a ruling that allowed Medicaid recipients to bring lawsuits to enforce the any-provider provision.",
      "\"We're here because of Planned Parenthood not being a qualified provider in South Carolina, but would this open the floodgates of people bringing\" lawsuits because they can't see the provider of their choice, she asked Kyle Hawkins, counselor to the solicitor general, who argued for the federal government.",
      "Separately, Project 2025, the policy blueprint overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to limit Planned Parenthood's funding through Medicaid in part by issuing guidance reemphasizing that states can strip the group of its public dollars in state plans.",

      "Ives, who said earlier said he had expected Tesla to report it had delivered as many as 360,000 vehicles during the first quarter, added that he believes Musk \"needs to stop this political firestorm and balance being CEO of Tesla with DOGE.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla slumped $12.77, or 4.8%, to $255.69 in early trading. The stock has plunged about 44% since hitting a high of $479 per share in December, when the stock soared on expectations that Musk's advisory role with the Trump administration would help the business through lower regulations and other benefits.",
      "Tesla's problems extend beyond the backlash over Musk's work with DOGE, however. The company's aging lineup is failing to attract buyers, although the automaker is expected to roll out a new lower-cost model later this year.",
      "In the meantime, some EV buyers are choosing to buy vehicles from rival automakers, with competitors from BMW to Toyota now offering a range of electric, hybrid or plug-in hybrid options. To some extent, Tesla's woes predate Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, with the company's revenue slipping 1%\u00a0last year, partly due to sluggish sales in the first six months of 2024.",
      "Still, the slump in 2025's first-quarter deliveries points to the backlash that some consumers are voicing over Musk's role in the Trump administration, Ives noted, adding that the more political the billionaire becomes, \"the more the brand suffers.\"",
      "\"Musk needs to get his act together or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla,\" Ives said in his April 2 research note.",

      "More than 200 luxury cruise ship passengers caught norovirus on a monthlong transatlantic voyage that won't officially end until Sunday, U.S. health officials said.",
      "A new outbreak report from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention tracked 224 of 2,538 passengers who became ill from the virus while on board the Cunard cruise line ship Queen Mary 2, along with 17 crew members. The vessel carried 1,232 crew overall, according to the CDC.",
      "Queen Mary 2 left Southampton in the United Kingdom March 8 on a route that first took it to New York and, then, down through the Caribbean, making various stops along the island chain, including St. Thomas and Barbados, according to an itinerary posted online by Cunard. The cruise sailed back to the U.K. on the same course it took to get to the Caribbean and is due to return to Southampton on April 6.",
      "Passengers and crew who contracted norovirus on the Queen Mary 2 mainly experienced diarrhea and vomiting, two of the most common symptoms of the highly contagious bug. The outbreak was reported to the CDC's vessel sanitation program, which monitors cruise ship outbreaks remotely and helps guide how crews respond to them, on March 18.",
      "The CDC said the crew of Queen Mary 2 worked to contain the spread of the virus by increasing cleaning and disinfection procedures, conducting tests to confirm cases of the illness and isolating sick passengers and crew.",
      "This is the latest in a series of norovirus outbreaks on ocean liners operated by some of the world's largest cruise companies. The latest outbreak comes on the heels of a surge in confirmed cases around the U.S. toward the end of last year.",

    "story": [
      "Susan Crawford, who was endorsed by the Democratic Party, won the closely-watched Wisconsin Supreme Court race Tuesday night in what was the most expensive judicial election in American history.",
      "What would have normally been a sleepy nonpartisan judicial race turned into an expensive battle between Crawford, a Dane County judge, and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who was endorsed by the Republican Party. The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and other national political figures.",
      "With 91% of the vote in, Crawford led Schimel by 54% to 45%, a margin of about 184,000 votes.",
      "The race was seen by some as an early swing-state test of voter sentiment related to President Trump's performance in the White House, but also a crucial statewide race that could swing ideological control of Wisconsin's closely divided highest court.",
      "Going into the race, liberals held a 4-3 majority, and the court is expected to consider cases related to abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting and election rules.",
      "By Monday morning, 644,800 advance ballots had been returned, representing about a 40% increase over the advance total in Wisconsin's 2023 judicial race, and that year also set a turnout record. About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.",
      "Nineteen percent of advance ballots had come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.",
      "Given that the more liberal candidate won the 2023 race by double digits, the early turnout numbers looked good for Crawford. But the bulk of the voting occurred on Election Day.",
      "Musk, the world's wealthiest person and an ally to Mr. Trump, personally campaigned and spent big in an effort to sway voters toward Schimel, who both he and Mr. Trump have endorsed.",
      "That effort nearly collided with the justices currently seated on the state's Supreme Court, when Musk was sued over his promise to hand out $1 million to individual voters at a campaign event over the weekend.",
      "The court unanimously declined on Sunday to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Musk's checks from going out. At a rally soon after the decision, Musk handed two people oversized posters depicting $1 million checks, declaring that the money was payment in exchange for promises they'd be spokespeople for his political group.",
      "Five of the court's seven justices have endorsed a candidate in the race. The court's liberal justices have endorsed Crawford. One of the court's conservative justices has endorsed Schimel, who wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat while campaigning Sunday.",

    "story": [
      "Colombian authorities released former Medellin Cartel boss Carlos Lehder on Monday after a judge ruled that a drug trafficking sentence issued in Colombia against the 75-year-old had expired.",
      "Lehder, one of the original \"cocaine cowboys\" and Pablo Escobar's crime partner, was arrested Friday night shortly after he landed in Bogota's airport on a flight from Germany, with immigration officials saying he was still wanted in the South American country on drug trafficking charges and weapons smuggling.",
      "Lehder became the first Colombian drug trafficker extradited to the United States after he was arrested during a party at his ranch.",
      "The former drug trafficker was extradited to the U.S. in 1987, where he served more than 30 years in prison. In 2020, Lehder was released after serving two-thirds of his U.S. sentence. He was\u00a0deported to Germany, where he is also a citizen.",
      "Lehder had not returned to Colombia since his extradition to the United States. His lawyer, Sondra Macollins, said he was attempting to visit relatives when he arrived Friday.",
      "\"He is recovering from cancer and has high blood pressure problems,\" Macollins told Colombia's Blu radio. \"We are talking about someone who spent years in dark cells.\"",
      "Colombian authorities convicted Lehder for drug trafficking in 1995, while he was serving the separate sentence at a U.S. prison. The cartel boss was sentenced to 24 years in prison in Colombia, meaning his sentence expired in 2019, according to Colombian law.",
      "The son of a German immigrant who arrived in Colombia in the 1920s, Lehder began his criminal career in the 1970s when he lived with relatives in New York City.",
      "He used his contacts and his knowledge of English to open cocaine markets for the Medellin Cartel and became a key ally of its boss, Escobar. He's portrayed in the Netflix series \"Narcos\" as a wild, ruthless criminal who set up a cocaine transit hub on a private island in the Bahamas, called Norman's Cay, that became a crucial stopover point for cocaine flights.",
      "In Colombia, he owned a luxurious rural hotel known as the Posada Alemana, which had caged lions on its grounds and a large statue of Lehder's favorite musician, John Lennon.",
      "In the U.S., Lehder was initially sentenced to life in prison but managed to reduce his sentence by providing U.S. investigators with information that was used to prosecute Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.",
      "As CBS News reported in 2015, the prosecution of Lehder and Noriega was aided by intelligence gathered by\u00a0Carlos Toro, a former high-ranking cartel member turned undercover DEA operative who assumed many false identities.",
      "Lehder's release Monday comes just a few months after another key operator of the Medellin cocaine cartel was let out of a U.S. prison. Records from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons show Fabio Ochoa V\u00e1squez was released in December after completing 25 years of a 30-year prison sentence.",
      "Ochoa, 67, and his older brothers amassed a fortune when cocaine started flooding the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to U.S. authorities, to the point that in 1987, they were included in Forbes Magazine's list of billionaires.

    "story": [
      "Marine Le Pen, the figurehead of the ascendant far-right political movement in France, was hit with a non-custodial prison sentence and barred from running in elections for five years on Monday as a court found her guilty of embezzling European Union funds to pay members of her National Rally party's staff. In handing down the sentence, the judge said the public office ban would take effect immediately.",
      "\"The court took into consideration, in addition to the risk of reoffending, the major disturbance of public order if a person already convicted ... was a candidate in the presidential election,\" judge Benedicte de Perthuis, was quoted as saying by the French news agency AFP.",
      "De Perthuis also sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison but said that part of her sentence would be served as house arrest, with her wearing an electronic tag, not in a prison. The judge suspended two of the four years of the prison sentence. He also fined her more than $100,000.",
      "Le Pen, speaking to French TV channel TF1 in her first reaction to the verdict, said she would appeal and called the ruling a \"political\" move aimed at preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "She said the court should not have made her ineligible to run for office until all her chances at appeal had been exhausted.",
      "\"If that's not a political decision, I don't know what is,\" she said.",
      "Le Pen would remain ineligible to be a candidate until the appeal is decided, but the house arrest and fine would be suspended during the appeals process.",
      "Le Pen said she would ask that the court proceedings take place before the 2027 campaign. Only an appellate ruling that overturns the ban on public office could restore her hopes of running. But, there's no guarantee that an appeals court would rule more favorably, and appeals in France can take several years to conclude.",
      "Rodolphe Bosselut, Le Pen's lawyer, said he was \"appalled\" by the court's decision, calling it \"extremely scandalous.\" He also vowed to launch an appeal against the guilty verdict.",
      "Recent polling has shown Le Pen likely would have won at least a first round in France's next national election, though it is much less clear how she would have fared in a second round against a more moderate candidate.",
      "Far-right political figures across Europe \u2014 including the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and Italy's Matteo Salvini\u00a0\u2014 condemned the verdict Monday.",
      "In Russia, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed Le Pen's sentencing was evidence of European nations \"going down the path of trampling over democratic norms.\"",
      "\"Of course, we do not want to interfere in France's internal affairs, we have never done so, and this is France's internal affair,\" said Peskov, \"but in general, our observations of European capitals show that they are not at all reluctant to go beyond democracy during the political process.\"",
      "Le Pen, 56, garnered 41% of the ballots in the last French presidential election in 2022 \u2014 beaten decisively by current President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 and she has made no secret of her desire to run again for the nation's highest office.",
      "Sat in the front row of the Paris court, Le Pen whispered \"incredible\" as the judge detailed his reasoning for the guilty verdict. She walked out of the court before the sentences were announced.",
      "Le Pen, along with eight current or former party members, had faced up to 10 years in prison on the embezzlement charges. A dozen others who served as parliamentary aides for the National Rally party, formerly the National Front, also received guilty verdicts for their role in the scheme.",
      "The judge said Le Pen and her colleagues did not enrich themselves personally but called the embezzlement \"a democratic bypass\" that duped the French parliament and voters. He said Le Pen was at the center of \"a system\" used to siphon off EU money intended to pay EU parliamentary aides, to instead pay party staff between 2004 and 2016.",
      "Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing, claiming prosecutors were \"only interested\" in barring her from the presidential election. She told La Tribune Dimanche\u00a0newspaper on Sunday, before the verdict was handed down, that the judges had \"the right of life or death over our movement.\"",
      "Le Pen may have no choice now but to cede her party's presidential ambitions to its current president, Jordan Bardella, a 29-year-old who took over as National Rally leader in 2021.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has said he sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressing his desire to negotiate over the country's advancing nuclear program.

      "\"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted \"to get that letter,\" adding that \"the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Iranian media reported that on Wednesday a letter from Mr. Trump was delivered to Tehran by a senior United Arab Emirates diplomat, the French news agency AFP said.",
      "Late last week Iran's state-run media said that no letter had been received from Mr. Trump, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French news agency AFP on Friday that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while heavy U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium,\" marking a progression in the country's nuclear program since Mr. Trump was reelected.",
      "In 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from a negotiated deal with Iran and other world powers that was aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program. Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for entirely peaceful purposes, as tension has continued to rise with the U.S. over its sanctions, and with Israel over its war against the Iranian-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.",

    "summary": "Prince Harry and his co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, abruptly resigned this week as patrons of Sentebale, the charity they established in honor of the late Princess Diana.",
    "story": [
      "The chairperson of an African charity co-founded by Prince Harry accused the royal on Sunday of orchestrating a bullying and harassment campaign to try to force her out, as she pushed back following his abrupt resignation from the organization.",
      "Sophie Chandauka, the chair of Sentebale, a charity Harry co-founded in 2006 that was long aimed at helping children in southern Africa who have HIV/AIDS, took several shots at Harry on Sky News. Chandauka said the prince's Netflix deal interfered with a scheduled fundraiser and that an incident with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, became a source of friction.",
      "The Duke of Sussex resigned Tuesday as a patron of Sentebale, which he helped establish in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana, citing a breakdown in the relationships between board members and Chandauka.",
      "Harry and co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, said in a joint statement that they quit \"with heavy hearts\" as patrons in solidarity with five trustees who resigned over an internal dispute with Chandauka, who refused to step down when asked. The stalemate reportedly involved a change in the organization's mission.",
      "\"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" the princes said in their statement. \"What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\"",
      "Chandauka sued the charity in order to remain in her position, according to the statement. She said that she reported Sentebale's trustees to the Charity Commission in the U.K. and filed papers in a British court to prevent her removal.",
      "She alleged there was misconduct at the charity without naming anyone or offering any details in a statement Tuesday. It said she had tried to blow the whistle on \"abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny and misogynoir,\" the latter word referring to a combination of racism and misogyny directed toward Black women.",
      "Chandauka told Sky that Harry's resignation had caught her blindsided and was \"an example of harassment and bullying at scale.\" She said he also had interfered with her whistleblower complaint.",
      "\"So it's a cover-up, and the prince is involved,\" she said.",
      "A source familiar with the events rejected that claim, telling CBS News that both Harry and Seeiso had sent a joint resignation letter to the chair as well as trustees on March 10. A source close to trustees and patrons of the charity told CBS News that Chandauka's \"publicity stunt\" had been expected, and that the princes' collective decision to step down was taken with it in mind.",
      "Chandauka said there was a significant drop in donors to Sentebale after Harry and Meghan left their official royal duties in January 2020 and eventually settled in California.",
      "The charity, whose name means \"don't forget me\" in the Sesotho language of Lesotho and South Africa, was founded to help youths affected by AIDS in the small mountainous nation and in Botswana. But it is now moving to address youth health, wealth and climate resilience across southern Africa.",
      "The biggest risk to the charity was the \"toxicity of its lead patron's brand,\" Chandauka argued in an interview with the Financial Times.",
      "In the Sky interview, she said a polo fundraiser scheduled in Miami last year almost fell apart when Harry asked to bring a camera crew along to film for a Netflix series he was shooting.",
      "The cost of the venue skyrocketed when it became a commercial venture and they scrambled to find another host, which Harry arranged through his connections, she said. Meghan's surprise appearance at the event led to an awkward moment during the trophy presentation after the match, Chandauka said.",
      "In a video clip circulated on social media, Chandauka tried to pose next to the duke as he held the trophy in one hand and had his other wrapped around Meghan. But the duchess appeared to gesture that Chandauka move farther from Harry, forcing her to duck under the silver cup to get into the photo.",
      "\"The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,\" Chandauka said.",
      "She said she rejected Harry's request that she issue a statement in support of Meghan, because \"we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.\"",
      "CBS News contacted Harry and Meghan and they declined to offer a formal response. An emailed request by The Associated Press seeking comment from their spokespeople was also not immediately returned.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:41:54 -0400",
    "summary": "",
    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "Legend states that Jackson, who served as president from 1829 to 1837, reportedly planted two magnolia trees at the White House to honor his late wife Rachel.

      "Speaking to Fox News Digital on Tuesday, consulting arborist Denice Britton explained that the tree \"could very likely be potentially dangerous.\"",

      "\"The southern magnolia is a fairly common tree that's planted pretty much all over the country\u2026 it is similar to cherry trees,\" Britton said. \"It is a hardwood, but it's considered a \u2018soft\u2019 hardwood in that it's got straight grain. It's valued by woodworkers.\"",
      "\"Because so many of the original old growth trees have been removed over the years, [the Jackson magnolia] is not a particularly old tree for a magnolia.\"",
      "Britton also noted that environmentalists who oppose the tree's felling would be remiss to ignore that repurposing wood helps save carbon.",
      "\"If you burn it, you release that carbon back to the atmosphere,\" she explained. \"If you cut it up and put it into a structure, then you're actually saving it\u2026 so you're prolonging the life of the carbon that's in the tree.\"",

      "The Senate amendment includes raising the debt ceiling in the key budget process by no more than $5 trillion. This has been a request of Trump since before he took office the second time. The date estimated for a potential default has been inching closer, presenting a looming problem for Republicans in the Senate.",

      "Republicans who argued to include the debt ceiling in reconciliation said it would prevent Democrats from having leverage down the road, when a vote to raise it would need 60 votes, forcing them to lobby Democrats for support.",
      "The amendment also stipulates that the provision to raise the debt ceiling can be voted on separate from the rest of the resolution, in the case that the \"X Date,\" when the Treasury is unable to meet its financial obligations without intervention, is set to arrive sooner than Republicans are prepared to vote on the entire reconciliation package.",

      "The Senate amendment would further make the House's proposed extension of the Trump tax cuts permanent, doing so by using a current policy baseline that allows budget projections to be made in what some view as a more practical and realistic way.",

However, no proof is provided, and investigations have found no signs of actual ransomware intrusions in affected organizations.

      "1. Install strong antivirus software and regularly update software:\u00a0The first line of defense against ransomware is ensuring that your systems are equipped with the latest security tools. Keep all software and devices\u00a0up to date to avoid vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Install firewalls,\u00a0strong antivirus software and intrusion detection systems to block malicious activities before they can cause harm. Regularly patch operating systems and applications to stay ahead of cybercriminals. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Implement strong password policies and use a password manager: Ensure all passwords are unique, at least 15 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This reduces the risk of password reuse and weak passwords, which are common entry points for ransomware attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "3. Educate and train employees on cybersecurity awareness:\u00a0Many ransomware attacks start with phishing emails or social engineering tactics. As seen in the scam targeting executives, attackers often use fear-based tactics to manipulate victims into acting quickly. Train your employees, particularly high-level executives, to recognize suspicious emails, fraudulent requests and phishing attempts.",
      "4. Backup data and maintain a secure recovery plan:\u00a0Data backups are a critical safeguard against ransomware. Regularly back up critical data to secure, offline locations that ransomware cannot access. Testing your recovery plans frequently ensures that if an attack does occur, you can recover quickly with minimal impact on operations. In addition, consider using a cloud service with encryption to ensure that even if an attack happens, the backup remains safe.",
      "5.\u00a0Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Two-factor authentication is an essential security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to sensitive systems and data. With 2FA, even if attackers manage to obtain login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access critical systems without the second factor of authentication, whether it\u2019s a code sent to a phone or biometric verification.",
      "6. Verify threats before taking action:\u00a0If you receive a ransom demand (digital or physical), investigate its legitimacy. Scams often lack proof of data breaches or network compromise. Consult cybersecurity experts or law enforcement before responding.",
      "7. Report suspicious activity: Notify law enforcement or organizations like the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you encounter scams or ransomware threats. Reporting helps authorities track and mitigate these activities.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare is seriously lagging when it comes to cybersecurity. It's crazy that so many health institutions don\u2019t have a CISO or a dedicated security team. Instead, the IT department, which isn\u2019t always trained in cybersecurity, gets stuck trying to handle it all. With so much sensitive data at risk, it\u2019s shocking that so many healthcare organizations still treat cybersecurity as an afterthought.",
      "Cyberattacks are only going to get worse, and unless the industry steps up its game, it\u2019s just a matter of time before more hospitals, clinics and health systems get hit. It\u2019s time to take security seriously.",

      "Cybersecurity researchers at Kaspersky recently discovered a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Google Chrome. The attack was triggered when victims unknowingly clicked on a phishing link in an email, launching a malicious site in their browser. Shockingly, no further action was required. Simply opening the link was enough to infect the system.",
      "According to\u00a0Kaspersky\u2019s report, the malware was based on a zero-day vulnerability, later identified as CVE-2025-2783. Researchers say they analyzed the exploit, reverse-engineered its logic and uncovered that it allowed attackers to bypass Chrome\u2019s built-in security features as if they didn\u2019t exist.",
      "The vulnerability exploited Chrome's inter-process communication framework, known as Mojo, which is crucial for the browser's functionality. This allowed the attackers to execute malicious code across different processes within Chrome, effectively bypassing its security measures.",

      "While updating Chrome should fix the vulnerability, below are some security tips you can follow to further bolster your privacy and security.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers often gain access to devices by sending infected emails or documents or by tricking you into clicking a link that downloads malware. You can avoid all of this by installing strong antivirus software that will detect any potential threat before it can take over your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Many online accounts, including Google, offer two-factor authentication as an extra security measure.\u00a0Enabling 2FA ensures that even if a hacker obtains your password, they still need a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, to access your account. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Use a secure password manager:\u00a0A strong password is crucial, but remembering multiple complex passwords can be difficult. A password manager generates, stores and autofills strong passwords for your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. Avoid using the same password across different sites and always opt for long, unique passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This incident serves as yet another reminder that even the most secure systems are never truly invulnerable, especially when state-backed or highly skilled actors are in play. While Google\u2019s quick response is commendable, it also highlights the never-ending cat-and-mouse game between security teams and cybercriminals. If you are using Chrome, update it now.",

    "summary": "This phishing kit bypasses 2FA via session hijacking and real-time credential theft. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson offers four ways to stay safe from Astaroth phishing attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips \u2013 sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",
      "An example of what the victim and attacker would see (SlashNext) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Astaroth is shockingly advanced",
      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",
      "Astaroth is widely available through Telegram and underground cybercrime forums. The anonymity of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to track distribution.",

      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

      "With just three seconds of audio, easily obtained from social media, voicemails or videos, fraudsters can create a convincing replica of your voice using AI. \"Imagine a situation where a 'family member' calls from what appears to be their phone number and says they have been kidnapped,\" explains Schroeder. \"Victims of these scams have said they were sure it was their family member's voice.\"",
      "These AI-generated voice clones can be used to manipulate loved ones, coworkers or even financial institutions into transferring money or sharing sensitive information, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent calls.",
      "Today's AI tools can generate convincing fake identification documents with AI-generated images. Criminals use these to verify identity when fraudulently opening accounts or taking over existing ones. These AI-generated fake IDs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often including realistic holograms and barcodes that can bypass traditional security checks and even fool automated verification systems.",

These AI-generated deepfakes are not limited to still images; they can also produce realistic videos that can fool liveness detection checks during facial recognition processes, posing a significant threat to biometric authentication systems.",
      "Similarly, GenAI now crafts flawlessly written, highly personalized\u00a0phishing emails that analyze your online presence to create messages specifically tailored to your interests and personal details. These AI-enhanced phishing attempts can also incorporate sophisticated chatbots and improved grammar, making them significantly more convincing and harder to detect than traditional\u00a0phishing scams.",

Those with substantial retirement savings or investments naturally represent more valuable targets \u2014 the more assets you have, the more attention you'll attract from criminals looking for bigger payoffs. Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously. Compounding this risk is an extensive digital footprint: if you're active on social media or have a significant online presence, you're inadvertently providing fraudsters with the raw materials they need to create convincing deepfakes and highly personalized scams designed specifically to exploit your trust.",

      "Protection against AI-powered threats requires a multi-layered approach that goes well beyond just digital measures. Awareness is your first line of defense \u2014 understanding how these scams work helps you spot red flags before you become a victim. This awareness should be paired with both digital safeguards and \"analog\" verification systems that exist entirely offline. Here are some key steps to protect yourself:",
      "1.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: Generative AI fundamentally needs your personal data to craft convincing scams, which is why limiting your online footprint has become paramount in today's fraud landscape. The less information about you that's publicly available, the fewer raw materials scammers have to work with. Going completely off-grid is unrealistic for most of us today \u2014 much like never leaving your home. But you can reduce your online footprint substantially with a personal data removal service like Incogni, making yourself significantly less exposed to AI-powered scams.",
      "By removing your personal data from data broker companies, you not only protect yourself from GenAI-powered fraud but also gain numerous other privacy benefits, such as reduced risks of receiving spam and falling victim to identity theft, as well as helping to prevent stalking and harassment. As AI technology advances, gen-AI scams will only become more sophisticated.

      "3. Choose strong, unique passwords for each account: Create complex passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

Receive MFA codes via an authenticator app on your phone rather than email when possible: Using an\u00a0authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator is more secure than receiving codes via email. Authenticator apps generate time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) that are not transmitted over email or SMS, reducing the risk of interception by hackers. Additionally, authenticator apps often support biometric authentication and push notifications, making the verification process both secure and convenient.",
      "6. Use a strong antivirus software: Modern cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with AI being used to create more convincing phishing attacks, deepfake scams, and malware. Investing in strong antivirus software can help identify and block suspicious activity before it reaches you.

But under Trump\u2019s new \"liberation day\" tariffs \u2013 25% on Canadian goods and 10% on energy \u2013 Ottawa now faces an economic gut punch that could ripple across key provinces, industries and its national election campaign.",
      "Trump has repeatedly blasted what he calls \"unfair\" trade practices, citing Canada\u2019s trade imbalance with the U.S. to justify the sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"This is the beginning of liberation day in America,\" Trump said last week. \"We\u2019re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they\u2019ve been taking over the years.

      "Increased tariffs could mean that Americans will see higher price tags on everything ranging from fertilizer and oil, vehicles and machinery, to plastic and wood products, which, theoretically, would deter consumers from purchasing those products and result in a loss for Canada\u2019s economy.",
      "Likewise, Canada in mid-March implemented reciprocal tariffs on\u00a0$30 billion worth of U.S. goods, which means Canadians will not only feel losses on a macro scale but also in an immediate sense as prices at the grocery store have spiked on things like\u00a0leafy greens, citrus, orange juice, beef, pork and fish.",
      "Ottawa has yet to announce any tariffs on U.S. imported vehicles due to reported concerns over how it could further hinder Canada\u2019s economy.

      "\"If they were to put on reciprocal tariffs, it would damage the Canadian standard of living and have an impact \u2013 as all this already is having an impact \u2013 in Canada,\" Hale said, noting that auto tariffs not only affect direct car sales but all businesses that rely on vehicles, creating a trickle-down effect.",

      "\"Most Canadians live within 100 miles of the U.S.-Canadian border, and so they obviously will be heavily impacted,\" said Hale. \"Most Americans don't.\"",
      "Hale noted that while the tariffs will affect the entire U.S., the hardest-hit areas will be industries closely tied to Canadian imports, such as agriculture. The U.S., for instance, sources 90% of its potash fertilizer from Canada.",
      "\"This will have a disproportionate impact on border states,\" Hale said, but he added that the economic strain on Canadian regions like Ontario will be far greater.",
      "Canadian leaders have already voiced concern that as many as 160,000 jobs could be lost in Quebec, along with another\u00a0500,000 jobs in Ontario, depending on how long the tariff dispute lasts.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump spoke to reporters on Sunday night from Air Force One, where he was asked about a third term, ceasefire negotiations with Russia and tariffs on Iran.",
      "Iranian military commanders are considering a preemptive strike on a joint U.S.-U.K. base on the Chagos Island located in the Indian Ocean in an apparent attempt to deter President Donald Trump from launching a military attack on Iran, a report by the Telegraph first said.",
      "\"Like any Iranian military threat, the art is to determine what is bluster and what is real,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital when asked about the strategy behind the alleged threats against the U.S. base.",
      "\"Deception is a propaganda tool used to bolster deterrence and prevent a conventionally weak regime from having to fight,\" he added. \"By threatening everywhere, the regime hopes to have to fight nowhere \u2013 meaning its revolutionary foreign policy gets to remain uncontested.",

      "Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the threat of attack on the Diego Garcia base, positioned some 2,400 miles south of Iran, but experts on Iranian security have been sounding the alarm that Tehran likely has, if not direct missile capabilities, options to position its arms that will enable it to hit U.S. strategic interests farther away.",
      "Iran has a \"self-imposed\" range of roughly 1,200 miles on its ballistic capabilities, though it is suspected that the IRGC has a ballistic strike capability of hitting up to 1,800 miles away using its Khorramshahr-2 medium-range ballistic missile, Ben Taleblu explained in a post on X.",
      "Tehran also has the updated version of the missile known as Khorramshahr-4, also referred to as the Kheibar missile,\u00a0which is suspected of being able to exceed Iran\u2019s other strike range options, though the extent of its capabilities has not been fully tested.",
      "But even if it is incapable of hitting a U.S. target some 2,400 miles from its most southern border, Iran has proven it is crafty when it comes to expanding its strike range \u2013 including through the use of merchant ships and oil tankers converted to warships to expand its long-range strike capabilities.",

      "\"There\u2019s always the chance of using a foreign-procured container launched cruise missile from even an unconverted tanker or commercial vessel at sea,\" Ben Taleblu explained in his post, referring to its use of both Russian and Chinese procured cruise missiles following its war with Iraq in the 1980s.",
      "In addition, Iran could again turn to its close ties to terrorist networks to transfer missile capabilities to war-torn areas like Yemen, which could enable it to strike further south into the Indian Ocean by some 800 miles.",
      "\"While all these options would make Iran\u2019s launch platforms, especially at sea, easy targets for a counterstrike, they mean that Tehran does have options to strike further afield than expected,\" Ben Taleblu said.",
      "Trump in recent days has increased his threats against Iran and warned there could be direct conflict if it doesn\u2019t stop arming the Houthi terrorist group, or halt its nuclear program.",
      "But it remains unclear at what level the U.S. would respond to a direct attack on its military, which could prove catastrophic for Tehran given its revealed defense capabilities when faced with strikes from Israel.",

      "Republicans say they\u2019re not panicking as they gear up for major races later this year and a fierce battle for control of Congress next year, despite getting shellacked in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \u2014 and seeing their margins decrease notably in a pair of special House election wins in deep-red Florida districts.",
      "Democrats have largely cast the 10-point win by the liberal candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race on Tuesday as a rejection by voters of Elon Musk, the billionaire White House adviser who took on a starring role in the campaign. And while the two wins by GOP candidates in Florida gave the party some breathing room with their narrow House majority, the size of their victories paled in comparison to what Republicans enjoyed in those districts five months ago.",
      "Republicans, however, downplayed the results as expected outcomes \u2014 criticizing some of the Republican candidates, discounting the prospect of any broader fallout from the heavy-handed role Musk played in Wisconsin, and suggesting that their candidates do a better job doubling down on explaining to voters Trump\u2019s accomplishments, including divisive ones like his Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "They\u2019re also focused on how to get the voters who put Trump over the top in 2024 to come out for other elections and candidates.",
      "Democrats have found some early success demonizing Musk in the Wisconsin race and believe they can expand that strategy. But while Musk will \u201ccontinue to be active\u201d in GOP campaigns, his prominent role in the party may be about to change: Trump told members of his Cabinet on March 24, more than a week before Tuesday\u2019s elections, that Musk would leave his government role in the administration in the coming months.",
      "\u201cI think a spring, off-year election with the deck stacked against you isn\u2019t necessarily a fair analysis of Musk\u2019s impact,\u201d said one Virginia-based Republican strategist about whether the party would be wise to draw conclusions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.",
      "National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said in a Tuesday night statement that Democrats \u201cset their cash ablaze\u201d in the deep-red Florida districts.",
      "\u201cFlorida\u2019s resounding Republican victories send a clear message: Americans are fired up to elect leaders who will fight for President Trump\u2019s agenda and reject the Democrats\u2019 failed policies,\u201d Marinella said.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Musk\u2019s presence in his state was a net-positive: \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt, he just helped,\u201d Johnson said of the recent race.",
      "And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis swept aside the idea of the closer margins in Florida\u2019s 6th Congressional District generating any broader concerns for the party. DeSantis blamed Republican Randy Fine\u2019s 12-point margin \u2014 down from 30-plus points for Trump in the district last year \u2014 on Fine himself, saying the state legislator, with whom DeSantis has clashed in the past, was a lackluster candidate.",
      "\u201cHe repels people,\u201d DeSantis said of Fine, adding that it \u201cwas unique problems with this candidate that was causing this to be a close race.\u201d",
      "Overall, said Jeanette Hoffman, a GOP strategist from New Jersey, which will host a gubernatorial race later this year, \u201cI\u2019m not seeing huge warning signs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m seeing status quo in these elections, and I think Republicans need to focus on running excellent local campaigns based on local issues and making sure their voters turn out in November,\u201d Hoffman continued.",
      "Democrats believe Tuesday\u2019s results show that their party has momentum ahead of this year\u2019s governor\u2019s races in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as next year\u2019s midterms more broadly. The Republican Senate majority looks well-defended, but Democrats need to net just five seats to flip the House.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are running scared,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., told NBC News. \u201cAnd they should be, because they\u2019re not listening to American people. Their agenda is not popular.\u201d",
      "Musk effect",
      "Democrats are also signaling they believe Musk could be an effective boogeyman for the party moving forward.",
      "\u201cIn this short period of time since the last election, we saw in these Florida elections, these bright red districts, the margins cut more than in half. And it\u2019s because folks are rejecting the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "Sam Newton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association, made it clear that the party was preparing to make the 2025 gubernatorial races about Musk and Trump, largely by charging DOGE with ruining lives by taking away government jobs and funding \u2014 a uniquely salient message in Virginia, which is home to more than 340,000 federal workers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of the DOGE effort is having the largest negative impacts,\u201d Newton said. He added that it wouldn\u2019t matter whether Musk left the administration imminently \u2014 or even curtailed his spending in the races later this year.",
      "\u201cThey can try to run from Elon Musk, but it\u2019s too late,\u201d he said.",
      "Republicans in Virginia, however, dismissed those warning shots, forecasting that the party would do more to further build the identity of the main Republican candidate in the race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "\u201cVirginia voters are smart enough to understand that they\u2019re electing a governor,\u201d said another GOP operative in the state. \u201cThey understand who is on the ballot: It\u2019s not Elon Musk. It\u2019s not anybody in the federal government. It\u2019s going to be [Democratic candidate] Abigail Spanberger and Winsome Sears.\u201d",
      "But Ed Rollins, a longtime GOP operative who is running a super PAC supporting conservative radio host Bill Spadea in the New Jersey governor\u2019s race, suggested Musk may be better suited as a traditional billionaire political benefactor for GOP campaigns than as a top surrogate.",
      "\u201dMy preference would be to have his millions of dollars to spend and have him send a check. I don\u2019t think he wants to campaign anymore than he already has. It\u2019s kind of a novelty for him,\u201d said Rollins.",
      "\u201cCampaigning is a whole different perspective and you\u2019ve got to move away from the sideshows,\u201d Rollins later added. \u201cAnd he was a sideshow obviously in Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "Focus on turnout",
      "Some Republicans did say that Tuesday\u2019s results showed that the GOP faces a persistent challenge in turning out Trump voters when the president is not on the ballot.",
      "\u201cSpecial elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,\u201d conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote on X Tuesday night, after referring to the party\u2019s reliance on more sporadic voters.",
      "\u201cThe base that came out to support Donald Trump during the presidential election, a lot of those voters stayed home,\u201d said Hoffman, the New Jersey GOP strategist. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to see a much lower turnout in the New Jersey governor\u2019s race than we did in the presidential race last year. So both parties really need to look at getting their base out and making sure their turnout operation\u2019s top notch.\u201d",
      "Hoffman said that turnout effort will hinge on affordability-focused messaging, with a high cost of living being the top issue in the high-tax state of New Jersey. She noted that Trump\u2019s involvement in the race \u201cwould certainly help to bring out the Republican base.\u201d",
      "Two of the top candidates in the New Jersey race \u2014 Spadea and former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarellii \u2014 have closely aligned with Trump, both meeting with the president last month at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club.",
      "One of the GOP candidates, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, has been more critical of the president generally. But he did not see Tuesday\u2019s results as signs that aligning with Trump is a problematic strategy.",
      "\u201cNovember is not going to be based on who you\u2019re with, who you like, who likes you. It\u2019s going to be: Are people tired of one-party rule in Trenton? I think the Democrats are very, very nervous in that regard, and they probably should be,\u201d Bramnick said.",
      "The two Virginia Republican operatives who said the path to victory for the GOP candidate in the race would rely on her ability to tie herself closely to Trump and to the state\u2019s popular Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited.",
      "\u201cYou need to make certain that you\u2019re locking arms with the president because he\u2019s seized the mantle of common sense \u2014 that\u2019s really powerful, and you need to lean back into that,\u201d said one of the operatives.",
      "Turning out those Trump voters will also be key for Republicans looking to hold onto control of Congress in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the Senate. Just one GOP senator, Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in November, so Democrats will be targeting some seats in states Trump won.",
      "Democrats will also have to reach into Trump territory to net the five seats they need to flip the House. While Democrats have plenty of ripe targets in districts that were decided by close margins last year, DelBene demurred on whether Tuesday\u2019s results show that redder districts are in play.",
      "\u201cOur job and our focus is making sure we take back the majority in the House. It still is, and we are going to be playing in districts across the country to make sure we win,\u201d DelBene said."

      "A University of Mississippi student who was the subject of an internet rumor is navigating the fallout after she says the lie, which was amplified by people including popular ESPN host and analyst Pat McAfee, \u201cruined\u201d her life.\u00a0Mary Kate Cornett, 19, told NBC News on Wednesday that she and her family have faced a barrage of harassment and insults in the weeks since a false rumor about her and her boyfriend\u2019s father went viral online.",
      "\u201cHaving your life ruined by people who have no idea who you are is the worst feeling in the world,\u201d Cornett said, while tearing up. \u201cIt makes you feel so alone. It\u2019s a horrible experience.\u201d",
      "The rumor involving Cornett, whose experience was detailed in a profile published by The Athletic earlier this week, was referenced on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d by the host, a former NFL player, and his guests as they discussed an alleged \u201cm\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\u201d at Ole Miss. Cornett and her boyfriend were not mentioned by name in the ESPN show.",
      "In the episode, which aired on Feb. 26, McAfee says an \u201cOle Miss frat bro\u201d allegedly \u201chad a K-D (Kappa Delta) girlfriend.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt this exact moment, this is what is being reported by \u2026 everybody on the internet: Dad had sex with son\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d he says, later adding, \u201cAnd then it was made public \u2026 that\u2019s the absolute worst-case situation.\u201d",
      "The conversation steered back toward college football after almost two and a half minutes. McAfee shared a clip about the discussion online to his 3.2 million X followers. The post, which is captioned \u201cWhat\u2019s going on at Ole Miss\u201d with two laughing crying face emojis, was still on the social media platform as of Wednesday and had been viewed 1.8 million times.",
      "The circulation of the rumor was enough, Cornett said, to further derail her life.",
      "ESPN and McAfee declined to comment.",
      "While the internet has propelled unknown people into stardom overnight, Cornett\u2019s experience has underscored the more toxic nature of virality.",
      "Cornett said her friends first told her about a rumor that was spreading on YikYak, an anonymous messaging-based app used by some college students, about a college student at her university and in her sorority who was sleeping with her boyfriend\u2019s father.",
      "Within an hour and a half of the rumor spreading, Cornett said she already started noticing people staring at her on campus. Eventually, she saw that her name was a top trending topic on X, with \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of posts falsely identifying her as the person at the center of the rumor.",
      "She said that she, her boyfriend and his father were shocked.",
      "\u201cIt was so insane. It all happened so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just in shambles. I just felt so helpless and so alone because so many people were hating on me for something that I had no idea anything about.\u201d",
      "After McAfee\u2019s show, others, including two personalities affiliated with Barstool Sports, referenced the rumor online. KFC Barstool posted a video about the incident to his personal account that was later deleted, according to The Athletic. Jack Mac\u2019s post, which was still on X as of Wednesday, promotes a meme coin that contains Cornett\u2019s name.",
      "A representative for Barstool Sports did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dave Portnoy, the owner of Barstool Sports, denied his website\u2019s involvement in spreading the rumor in a statement to other media outlets.",
      "\u201cBarstool Sports did not mention or spread this rumor on any of our Barstool owned channels,\u201d he said in a statement to Rolling Stone. \u201cOur editors instinctively made the decision to avoid this story as it seemed there was a high likelihood it could have been fabricated.\u201d",
      "In his statement to the publication, he said he\u2019s aware that one of the company\u2019s \u201cemployees posted something on their personal socials but we don\u2019t control those.\u201d",
      "Monica Uddin, Cornett\u2019s attorney, said she believes what happened to her client is cyberbullying and grounds for a defamation case.",
      "\u201cDefamation has existed for a long time. You can\u2019t lie about someone with impunity \u2014 and that\u2019s what has happened to Mary Kate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie for money.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot using her name is not a \u2018Get Out of Jail Free\u2019 card, saying \u2018allegedly\u2019 is not a \u2018Get Out of Jail Free\u2019 card,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cThese people are responsible for what they have done to her.\u201d",
      "I just felt so helpless and so alone because so many people were hating on me for something that I had no idea anything about.",
      "-Mary Kate Cornett, 19",
      "Cornett said she intends to take legal action against McAfee and ESPN, and potentially others who, she said, helped spread the rumor.",
      "Uddin said Cornett is prepared to be deposed to prove her case.",
      "Since the rumor began circulating, Cornett said nothing about her life has been the same.",
      "\u201cThis has affected me in such an awful way and has practically ruined my life,\u201d Cornett said, adding that McAfee \u201cnever once reached out to ask me if this was true or for me to give any sort of statement to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought it was absolutely ridiculous that an ESPN sports broadcaster would be talking about a 19-year-old girl\u2019s \u2018sex scandal\u2019 that was completely false,\u201d Cornett said.",
      "Police showed up to Cornett\u2019s mother\u2019s home in Houston, she said, with guns drawn in what she described as an apparent \u201cswatting\u201d incident, which is the act of making a false report of extreme violence in order to elicit an overwhelming law enforcement response to someone\u2019s home.",
      "NBC News has reviewed screenshots of security camera footage of the incident, provided by Cornett\u2019s attorney, appearing to confirm the \u201cswatting\u201d occurred.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the Houston Police Department for comment.",
      "Cornett said her number was shared online and that she was overwhelmed with \u201cthousands\u201d of calls and texts, with some telling her she \u201cdeserved to die.\u201d She said she could barely leave her dorm room and had to switch to online classes.",
      "Cornett denounced people who talked about her online, suggesting they did so for clout.",
      "\u201cI want these famous people to know that I was not famous before this,\u201d she said. \u201c ... I am a normal 19-year-old college freshman. That\u2019s it. I was happy. I had a great friend group.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a public figure that you can go talk about on your show to get more views,\u201d she added.",
      "Justin Cornett, Cornett\u2019s dad, said that as a parent he was \u201cworried\u201d that his daughter \u201cwouldn\u2019t recover.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou just want to protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful person. She has a tender heart and a kind soul.\u201d",
      "Now, he said he \u201cwants justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people that did this to her and her boyfriend and his dad deserve what they have coming to them,\u201d he said.",
      "When asked what he would say to McAfee, Justin Cornett said, \u201cWhen you have a microphone and you have a platform, you have a responsibility to take on that role with the respect of the people you report on being paramount. If this were to happen to him, his daughter, his wife, someone he loves, he sure wouldn\u2019t like it. When you have a microphone, you have a responsibility and it needs to be taken seriously.\u201d",
      "For days after the rumor first flooded the internet, Cornett said she couldn\u2019t sleep and would throw up after experiencing anxiety. She defended herself online, sharing an Instagram post the day after McAfee\u2019s show aired.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, this rumor is 100% completely false and it is quite frankly, inexcusable that such disturbing accusations went viral,\u201d she wrote at the time, adding that \u201cCyber attacks based on nothing but lies and misinformation happen all too often.\u201d",
      "She issued a similar warning about the dangers of how false information can spread on social media during her interview with NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf this happened to me, this could happen to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing I could have done to prevent what happened to me.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Fifty years ago, life expectancy in the U.S. and wealthy European countries was relatively similar.",
      "That began to change around 1980. As European life expectancy steadily increased, the U.S. struggled to keep pace \u2014 and its life expectancy even began declining in 2014.",
      "Today, the wealthiest middle-aged and older adults in the U.S. have roughly the same likelihood of dying over a 12-year period as the poorest adults in northern and western Europe, according to a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Some medical and health policy experts say the trend is a sign of deep-seated issues not just within the U.S. health care system, but with the typical American lifestyle of overconsuming junk food, not getting enough exercise and facing loneliness or financial stress.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really concerning because, to me, what it\u2019s saying is that the set of stressors that are harming the health of Americans is very widespread, to the point where even being wealthy or rich, you\u2019re not going to be able to escape them,\u201d said Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani, an associate professor of health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but wasn\u2019t involved in it.",
      "The study looked at the relationship between wealth and mortality among nearly 74,000 adults from 2010 to 2022. More than 19,000 of the adults were in the U.S., and roughly 54,000 were spread across 16 countries in Europe. All were ages 50 to 85.",
      "The researchers divided the participants into four groups based on their overall assets (not including their homes). In both Europe and the U.S., the group with the most assets \u2014 the wealthiest \u2014 had a 40% lower mortality rate than the poorest group.",
      "The poorest people in the U.S. had the highest mortality rate of any group, which is consistent with previous research showing that health outcomes are worse in America.",
      "\u201cWe were expecting to find greater inequity in the U.S. But what was surprising was how the richest in the U.S. compared to the richest in Europe,\u201d said Irene Papanicolas, the study\u2019s lead author, who directs the Center for Health System Sustainability at Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health.",
      "The wealthiest group in northern and western Europe had mortality rates about 35% lower than the wealthiest group in the U.S., she said.",
      "Venkataramani said the findings can\u2019t be generalized to the entire U.S. population, but he added that he \u201cwould not be surprised if these patterns held up in other age groups.\u201d",
      "Poor health outcomes in the U.S. are often attributed, in part, to a lack of access to affordable health care, which can result in high out-of-pocket costs for medication or procedures \u2014 or in some cases, not seeing a doctor at all.",
      "However, several experts said social and economic factors \u2014 such as loneliness or stress \u2014 are more likely to affect mortality rates in wealthier adults.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to pin what\u2019s happening on health care access,\u201d Venkataramani said. \u201cCertainly health care must have something to do with it, but it cannot be even a dominant part of the story if we\u2019re seeing wealthier Americans having similar or worse outcomes than poor individuals in other wealthy countries.\u201d",
      "In addition to universal health care, many European countries offer free or heavily subsidized higher education and more comprehensive unemployment benefits compared with the U.S.",
      "\u201cA lot of these countries have social welfare programs that don\u2019t prevent people from losing their jobs or experiencing poverty, but when they go through those tough times, it doesn\u2019t threaten their health,\u201d said Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.",
      "People in the U.S. also consume more ultra-processed foods and have higher rates of obesity compared with Europeans, which can increase their risk of diabetes or heart disease \u2014 an issue Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to address in office.",
      "Kennedy has frequently pointed to the fact that Americans have worse health outcomes compared with peer countries.",
      "\u201cOur lifespan has dropped. So Americans now live six years shorter than Europeans. We are the sickest nation in the world and we have the highest rate of chronic disease,\u201d he said last week in a video post on X announcing layoffs of around 20,000 HHS employees.",
      "But Woolf said the Trump administration\u2019s recent gutting of federal health agencies and termination of research grants puts the U.S. on the wrong trajectory when it comes to lowering risk factors for mortality.",
      "\u201cThe thing that\u2019s alarming us so much in the health and medicine world is that the policies that are now being pursued in a pretty muscular way are the opposite of what you would want to do to make America healthy again,\u201d he said, referring to Kennedy\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cIn all likelihood, my prediction will be that the gap in health between Americans and people in other countries is now going to widen even more dramatically,\u201d Woolf said.",
      "According to HHS, the consolidation and cuts are meant to make the branch more efficient and work toward ending chronic disease. White House spokesman Kush Desai added that \u201cthe United States is by far the largest funder of scientific research and is home to the world\u2019s largest ecosystem for innovation and research.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration spending its first two months to review the previous administration\u2019s projects, identify waste, and realign our research spending to suit the priorities of the American people is not going to upend America\u2019s innovative dominance,\u201d Desai said."

      "But Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a nonprofit group for reproductive health, said one of Trump\u2019s best assets to address IVF was now gone.",
      "\u201cThis is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,\u201d Collura said. \u201cThese are the right people to have at your side.\u201d",
      "Aaron Levine, a professor of public policy at Georgia Tech who has worked with the CDC team over the last decade, called it an \u201cimmediate loss\u201d for patients who want to make a well-informed decision.",
      "\u201cThe data was produced at the clinic level every year, so you could say, \u2018Is this clinic successful 15% of the time, 20% of the time, 25% of the time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can imagine that is super valuable information for patients considering IVF, or maybe considering IVF at multiple clinics, and trying to make their choices.\u201d",
      "Dr. Brian Levine, founding partner and practice director of CCRM Fertility of New York, said about 1 in 6 people experience infertility both globally and in the U.S.",
      "IVF was first used in the 1970s. It involves combining eggs and sperm in the lab to create embryos. Those embryos are then implanted in a woman\u2019s uterus.",
      "IVF is the most common type of infertility treatment in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than 8 million babies have been born via IVF since 1978, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The success rate varies, with age being the strongest factor. Women younger than 35 have a success rate of around 46%, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That drops to 22% for women at age 38.",
      "Patients deserve to know the success rates of each clinic, and the elimination of the CDC group gives them one less resource, Brian Levine said.",
      "\u201cPatients are highly motivated for treatments because they want a family, but they\u2019re also walking in a state of sometimes despair,\u201d he said.",
      "Knowing the success rates also helps keep clinics accountable, forcing them to make changes that could help improve the quality of care.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a pervasive disease like this, it gives a lot of women angst,\u201d Brian Levine said, referring to infertility. \u201cWe typically report to the CDC, so I know that my colleagues across the country are practicing to the same standards.\u201d",
      "A 'tremendous resource'",
      "The Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team was mandated by Congress in 1992. It worked under the CDC\u2019s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted Tuesday.",
      "The team was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF, including whether women gave birth to multiples or delivered prematurely, to ensure both the safety and success of the procedure.",
      "It also provided tools to the public, including an \u201cIVF success estimator\u201d that allowed people to plug in information about themselves and get an estimate of how well IVF would work. People could also look up each individual clinic\u2019s success rates across the U.S.",
      "It also did research on different IVF topics, including how to make it more efficient with fewer side effects, and how to make the extremely expensive procedure more accessible.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a tremendous resource within the government,\u201d Collura said. \u201cThey\u2019re also public-facing. All the content is on the CDC website; they\u2019re putting out all the information for patients.\u201d",
      "\u201cI rely on their information and their data to do my work,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s going to look like now going forward.\u201d",
      "One CDC worker on the team who was terminated Tuesday tried to reconcile Trump\u2019s comments on IVF and the mass layoffs.",
      "The worker, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said the group was preparing to publish new data on the success rates of IVF across states, but now that work has stopped indefinitely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me,\u201d the worker said. \u201cPresident Trump said he was the fertility president. How does cutting this program support that?\u201d",
      "An official at the Department of Health and Human Services said that \u201cthe work will continue\u201d \u2014 although they didn\u2019t provide details on how or when the administration would continue to track and collect data on IVF.",
      "\u201cWe are focused on implementing and bringing Secretary Kennedy\u2019s high-level vision of HHS\u2019 transformation to life,\u201d the official said in. an emailed statement. \u201cThe Department is mapping out what each of the 15 redefined divisions will look like at a detailed level and will share more information soon.\u201d",
      "Aaron Levine, of Georgia Tech, noted that there are other groups that track IVF outcomes, such as the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, a professional group, although the data appears to be more limited.",
      "In a statement, Micah Hill, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, called the cuts to the IVF group\u00a0 \u201cdangerous and devastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe depth of expertise held by CDC personnel will be difficult to replace,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIn many ways, the American public health system has been the global leader, and we are now in danger of throwing that away and doing so in a manner that may be very difficult to recover from.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Amazon has made a late bid to purchase TikTok, a person familiar with the ongoing White House-led discussions to identify a non-Chinese buyer for the social media app told NBC News.",
      "The bid, first reported by The New York Times, arrived this week, via a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Given the last-minute timing, days before a Saturday deadline to stave off a ban of the app in the U.S., the bid is not being treated as serious, said the source, who was granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations.",
      "A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. A representative for Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Donald Trump was expected to weigh TikTok offers Wednesday during an Oval Office meeting with Vance, Lutnick and other high-ranking administration officials. Trump has tapped Vance and national security adviser Michael Waltz to lead the effort to resolve TikTok\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cIf and when there is an announcement on TikTok, it will come from President Trump,\u201d a White House official said Wednesday.",
      "The app has been in limbo in the U.S. since last year, when then-President Joe Biden signed bipartisan legislation that forced its Chinese-based owner, ByteDance, to sell it to a non-Chinese buyer or face a nationwide ban. No such deal came to fruition, and Trump extended the deadline through an executive order he signed on his first day in office, effectively giving TikTok until Saturday, April 5, to find a solution that would keep it online.",
      "ByteDance, which has said it did not plan to sell, still has not publicly confirmed talks with any buyers or officially stated that it is willing to sell TikTok.",
      "White House officials and Vance aides have kept a close hold on details of the TikTok talks, with the full slate of potential buyers or partners remaining a mystery. And despite Wednesday\u2019s scheduled meeting, there was no sign of an imminent deal. Trump, for his part, has expressed a willingness to extend the deadline again if an agreement is not reached by Saturday.",
      "That\u2019s an outcome Vance has said he would like to avoid. But the vice president acknowledged in an interview with NBC News last month that while the broad contours of a TikTok deal could be in place by the deadline, the finer points might take longer to reconcile.",
      "\u201cTypically, some of these deals that are much smaller and involve much less capital take months to close,\u201d Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics as a U.S. senator from Ohio, said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to close this thing by early April. I think that the outlines of this thing will be very clear. The question is whether we can get all the paper done.\u201d",
      "Bipartisan efforts to ban the app date back to Trump's first presidential term, during which he tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok. Since then, the president has shifted his stance. While running for a nonconsecutive second term last year, Trump shared a viral video on the platform in which he said he was going to \"save TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok had challenged the potential ban, but the\u00a0Supreme Court upheld it\u00a0in the final days of the Biden administration.\u00a0The app\u00a0briefly went dark\u00a0in the U.S. just before Trump\u2019s inauguration, but\u00a0restored service\u00a0after the president signaled he would review the ban.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump appeared confident that there would be a deal.",
      "\"We have a lot of potential buyers,\" he told reporters. \"There's tremendous interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision. TikTok is, it's very interesting, and a lot of people want to buy it.\"",
      "Suitors that have expressed interest in acquiring the app include the likes of Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who joined billionaire investor Frank McCourt\u2019s bid; artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI; and Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary in the first Trump administration."

      "A manager at a Philadelphia-area Planet Fitness allegedly refused to allow good Samaritans to use the gym\u2019s defibrillator on a man who suffered a heart attack outside, a lawsuit says.",
      "Guy Harris, 46, died Jan. 22 after going into cardiac arrest near a Planet Fitness in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, according to the wrongful death suit filed by his wife Wednesday in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas.",
      "A married father of two, Harris had been driving his 11-year-old son to get a snack after school when he started experiencing symptoms of a heart attack, prompting him to pull over, the legal complaint said. He parked a short distance from the entrance to the Planet Fitness, where he was a member, it said.",
      "Harris\u2019 son got out of the car, called 911 and pleaded for help from passersby, said the lawsuit, which was\u00a0 first reported by NBC News. The legal filing said that one bystander who worked in the medical field began CPR on Harris, while another told customers exiting Planet Fitness to go back inside to ask for the gym\u2019s automated external defibrillator, or AED \u2014 a portable device that delivers an electric shock to try to restore a person\u2019s heartbeat.",
      "\u201cTwo Planet Fitness patrons returned to the club and requested the AED, indicating that a man was dying outside,\u201d the lawsuit read. \u201cDespite knowing about the life-or-death situation unfolding, the Planet Fitness club manager refused.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit names Planet Fitness Inc., which is headquartered in New Hampshire, and Keystone NFP Clifton LLC, the franchisee operator in Clifton Heights, as defendants. Neither immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment.",
      "Harris\u2019 wife, Taniqua Morene-Harris, declined to comment. An attorney for her said that the couple had been married for nearly 21 years and that Harris died the day before their son turned 12.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all just shocked by this whole occurrence and how it happened,\u201d said Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC. \u201cAEDs save lives \u2014 but only if they\u2019re used.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear from the lawsuit why the Planet Fitness manager, who is not identified or named as a defendant, allegedly refused to allow the use of the AED. The suit said bystanders continued to try to resuscitate Harris using CPR, but he was pronounced dead later that day after an ambulance rushed him to the hospital.",
      "The lawsuit accuses Planet Fitness and its franchisee operator of negligence that led to Harris\u2019 \u201cextreme pain and suffering and untimely death.\u201d It seeks a jury trial and unspecified damages.",
      "Planet Fitness has more than 2,700 clubs throughout the world, its website says.",
      "Crawford called what happened at the Clifton Heights location a \u201cdeliberate decision to withhold life-saving measures.\u201d She said the fact that Harris\u2019 cardiac event happened outside the gym was no excuse for denying access to an AED.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that someone could have a heart attack outside the facility just as much as they could have it in the facility,\u201d she said."

      "Carey Stewart Cezar, a retired nurse who lives in Baltimore, watched with dismay Wednesday as President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports.",
      "Cezar voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in last year\u2019s presidential election and opposes Trump\u2019s economic policies. But she said she has another reason to be skeptical of Trump\u2019s tariffs: She is a descendant of one of the legislators behind the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, a law that many economic historians believe worsened the Great Depression.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible idea and potentially devastating,\u201d Cezar, 70, said in a phone interview Wednesday, a few hours after Trump announced plans to impose duties on goods brought into the United States from other countries. \u201cI think people don\u2019t remember all the harm caused by tariffs in our history.\u201d",
      "Cezar\u2019s great-grandfather was Rep. Willis C. Hawley, an Oregon Republican who sponsored the 1930 tariff act with Sen. Reed Smoot, a Utah Republican. The act, which President Herbert Hoover signed into law roughly a year into the Great Depression, increased duties, set off a trade war and \u2014 in the eyes of many historians \u2014 aggravated the effects of the era\u2019s economic downturn.",
      "The law was \u201cone of the most controversial tariff acts ever enacted by Congress,\u201d Doug Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in 2020. (Irwin said Wednesday on X that Trump\u2019s expansive tariffs are \u201cbigger than Smoot-Hawley.\u201d)",

      "Cezar, whose great-grandfather died in 1941, said the law was part of her early education, too. \u201cThe Smoot-Hawley Act is part of my family\u2019s history, and I learned about it as a kid,\u201d she said.",
      "She recalled that her mother was \u201cdeeply embarrassed\u201d by the last name Hawley when she was growing up in Baltimore in the wake of the Great Depression. She was ashamed of being linked with a law that had intensified economic devastation, Cezar said.",
      "\u201cShe was happy to get a new name when she got married,\u201d Cezar added.",

      "A University of Mississippi student who was the subject of an internet rumor is navigating the fallout after she says the lie, which was amplified by people including popular ESPN host and analyst Pat McAfee, \u201cruined\u201d her life.\u00a0Mary Kate Cornett, 19, told NBC News on Wednesday that she and her family have faced a barrage of harassment and insults in the weeks since a false rumor about her and her boyfriend\u2019s father went viral online.",
      "\u201cHaving your life ruined by people who have no idea who you are is the worst feeling in the world,\u201d Cornett said, while tearing up. \u201cIt makes you feel so alone. It\u2019s a horrible experience.\u201d",
      "The rumor involving Cornett, whose experience was detailed in a profile published by The Athletic earlier this week, was referenced on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d by the host, a former NFL player, and his guests as they discussed an alleged \u201cm\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\u201d at Ole Miss. Cornett and her boyfriend were not mentioned by name in the ESPN show.",
      "In the episode, which aired on Feb. 26, McAfee says an \u201cOle Miss frat bro\u201d allegedly \u201chad a K-D (Kappa Delta) girlfriend.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt this exact moment, this is what is being reported by \u2026 everybody on the internet: Dad had sex with son\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d he says, later adding, \u201cAnd then it was made public \u2026 that\u2019s the absolute worst-case situation.\u201d",
      "The conversation steered back toward college football after almost two and a half minutes. McAfee shared a clip about the discussion online to his 3.2 million X followers. The post, which is captioned \u201cWhat\u2019s going on at Ole Miss\u201d with two laughing crying face emojis, was still on the social media platform as of Wednesday and had been viewed 1.8 million times.",
      "The circulation of the rumor was enough, Cornett said, to further derail her life.",
      "ESPN and McAfee declined to comment.",
      "While the internet has propelled unknown people into stardom overnight, Cornett\u2019s experience has underscored the more toxic nature of virality.",
      "Cornett said her friends first told her about a rumor that was spreading on YikYak, an anonymous messaging-based app used by some college students, about a college student at her university and in her sorority who was sleeping with her boyfriend\u2019s father.",
      "Within an hour and a half of the rumor spreading, Cornett said she already started noticing people staring at her on campus. Eventually, she saw that her name was a top trending topic on X, with \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of posts falsely identifying her as the person at the center of the rumor.",
      "She said that she, her boyfriend and his father were shocked.",
      "\u201cIt was so insane. It all happened so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just in shambles. I just felt so helpless and so alone because so many people were hating on me for something that I had no idea anything about.\u201d",
      "After McAfee\u2019s show, others, including two personalities affiliated with Barstool Sports, referenced the rumor online. KFC Barstool posted a video about the incident to his personal account that was later deleted, according to The Athletic. Jack Mac\u2019s post, which was still on X as of Wednesday, promotes a meme coin that contains Cornett\u2019s name.",
      "A representative for Barstool Sports did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dave Portnoy, the owner of Barstool Sports, denied his website\u2019s involvement in spreading the rumor in a statement to other media outlets.",
      "\u201cBarstool Sports did not mention or spread this rumor on any of our Barstool owned channels,\u201d he said in a statement to Rolling Stone. \u201cOur editors instinctively made the decision to avoid this story as it seemed there was a high likelihood it could have been fabricated.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer as to why he had to be put down other than it relates back to what happened,\u201d said Albert Whitehead, who cared not only for the 8-year-old reindeer named Star but also the decades-long tradition of having a reindeer in downtown Anchorage.",
      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen\u2019s gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star\u2019s pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",

      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows."

      "Trump said he will put a 46% duty on imports from Vietnam as part of a new wave of global levies announced Wednesday.\u00a0That could soon raise costs for major corporations in the apparel, furniture and toy space, and some of them may pass those increases to consumers in the form of price hikes. The tariffs on Vietnam take effect on April 9.",

      "Steve Madden, for example, said on an earnings call in early November that it would slash its imports to the U.S. from China\u00a0by as much as 45%\u00a0over the next year. The footwear maker made that announcement just days after Trump\u2019s presidential victory, following his campaign trail promises to impose steep tariffs on countries like China.",

      "Those toymakers did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s requests for comment.",
      "Curtis McGill is the co-founder of Hey Buddy Hey Pal, a toy company that specializes in Easter egg decorating kits. He said he expects the 46% tariffs to raise toy costs in the U.S., but added companies will likely be negotiating with suppliers in Vietnam to try to mitigate those hikes.",

      "American Eagle shares dipped more than 5% on Wednesday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Yet both Mathias and American Eagle CEO Jay Schottenstein said on the company\u2019s last earnings call that it will be crucial to stay flexible, while waiting to see how tariffs would play out and which countries would be targeted.",
      "Schottenstein referred to eight years ago during the first Trump administration, when American Eagle also faced challenges and had to figure out a new plan.",

      "Unlike the narrower, targeted tariffs Trump imposed on certain countries and products in his first term, his latest duties are set to rewrite the rules of global trade on a far broader level \u2014 and in an environment in which inflation is running hotter.",
      "\u201cThis is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note Wednesday evening.",
      "\u201cMany countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,\u201d she said, adding that the levels Trump is introducing haven\u2019t been seen since 1910.",
      "Already, the administration is signaling it\u2019s uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than press for talks.",
      "\u201cThis is not a negotiation,\u201d a senior White House official told reporters Wednesday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s a national emergency.\u201d",
      "The European Union has threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves to respond swiftly to any trade actions the United States were to unveil Wednesday.",
      "The legal authority Trump has invoked for his reciprocal tariffs \u2014 which range from 10% for some countries to as high as 54% for others \u2014 allows him to circumvent many of the typical procedures for instituting new trade barriers. The use of emergency powers not only allows the White House to impose tariffs immediately but also leaves room for the trade war to remain open-ended, with the administration potentially adjusting its levies more or less on the fly until the end of Trump\u2019s term.",
      "A senior automotive executive criticized the 25% tariffs on foreign-built vehicles and auto parts, announced last week, as \u201cprocess salad\u201d \u2014 contrasting the administration\u2019s approach with typical trade policy moves, which tend to give industry stakeholders more clarity about what\u2019s changing and how to prepare for it.",
      "\u201cWe would characterize this slate of tariffs as worse than the worst-case scenario,\u201d Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients Wednesday evening.",
      "Still, he said, \u201cwe continue to believe there are off ramps and major negotiations that will be happening over the coming months, with various countries and companies to navigate this new world.\u201d",
      "But Ives and other analysts warn that the unfolding trade war is packed with unknowns and has far greater potential for unintended consequences than any trade policy moves Trump has made previously, including during his first stint in the Oval Office.",
      "\u201cTrump just threw a match on an explosive tinder pile of already weakened inflation concerns,\u201d David Beckworth, a former U.S. Treasury economist who is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese new tariffs are a perfect recipe for stagflation and a lost midterm elections.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke in categorical, and at times lurid, terms Wednesday about the goals of his tariff agenda, describing the United States as having been \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by its trade partners. Domestic industry \u201cwill be reborn,\u201d he vowed, and a \u201cgolden age of America\u201d is on the way.",
      "For now, though, investors and corporate leaders across industries are left speculating about what may come next. The automotive executive expected the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term, to be replaced eventually by two separate trade deals \u2014 one with each North American neighbor.",
      "One thing remains certain, economists and business leaders say: Ordinary households are likely to pay more.",
      "\u201cConsumers should expect to see higher prices for everything from groceries to home renovations to auto insurance,\u201d National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said in a statement. \u201cThere is simply no way to mitigate all of the added costs of inputs to finished goods from the administration\u2019s complex and growing web of tariffs.\u201d",
      "How far that web extends, whom it ensnares \u2014 and what holes might be carved in it \u2014 remain to be seen."

      "\"It\u2019s going to be up to President Trump to see what he wants to do. I think the mindset might be to let things settle for a while,\u201d Bessent said, adding: \u201cI am sure there are going to be a lot of calls. I just don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be negotiations.\u201d",

This is not the act of a friend,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference Thursday morning in Melbourne, according to Bloomberg News. \u201cToday\u2019s decision will add to uncertainty in the global economy, and it will push up costs for American households.\u201d"

      "Lawyers for Erik and Lyle Menendez urged a judge to block an effort from Los Angeles\u2019 top prosecutor to withdraw his office\u2019s support for reducing the brothers\u2019 sentences of life without the possibility of parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents.",
      "The reasons Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman presented for the withdrawal are either \u201cpatently meritless\u201d or were considered and rejected by Hochman\u2019s predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, the brothers' lawyers argued in an 88-page filing.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who was voted out of office in November, described the brothers as \u201cexceptional\u201d inmates and supported resentencing them to 50 years to life in prison, which would have made them eligible for parole immediately.",
      "Last month, Hochman said he had withdrawn from that recommendation because the brothers, now 54 and 57, had not fully acknowledged more than a dozen lies they told about the murders, including that they killed their parents in self-defense.",

      "Prosecutors have described the murders as cold-blooded and financially-motivated.",
      "The brothers' 1993 trial, which was televised and captured national attention, ended with a hung jury. They were convicted of first-degree murder in their second trial.",

      "\u201cFrom the day they were convicted, and as they matured in prison over the many years since trial, in both court filings and public interviews, they have both taken responsibility for the shooting and expressed deep remorse,\u201d the filing states.",
      "\"From a rhetorical perspective, Erik and Lyle certainly understand the District Attorney's continued focus on falsehoods they told in the aftermath of the crime and even during their 1993 and 1996 trials,\" the filing states. \"But case law makes clear that this conduct is of relatively little importance to the question of current dangerousness.\"",
      "The district attorney's office did not immediately provide a comment in response to the filing.",
      "Resentencing is only one path the brothers have relied on in their effort to get out of prison.",
      "In 2023, they filed a petition seeking to overturn their conviction that cites what their defense has described as new evidence that supports their claims of sexual abuse. They also filed a clemency request with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Both efforts are ongoing."

      "Trump ramps up his trade war",
      "President Donald Trump unveiled expansive tariffs on the United States\u2019 largest trading partners as he pledged to embark on the biggest reorganization of the global economy since World War II, Rob Wile reports.",
      "Importers seeking to bring goods into the U.S. from other countries will now face tariffs as high as 54% based on how the White House is calculating duties on U.S. exports, as well as \u201cnonmonetary\u201d trade barriers based on countries\u2019 doing things like manipulating their currencies or serving as \u201cpollution havens.\u201d",
      "The result was a list of tariffs that are set to impose major duties on billions \u2014 if not trillions \u2014 of dollars in trade. China, one of the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, would be hit with a 54% tariff, the European Union with 20%, India with 26% and Japan with 24%, among many others.",
      "It was not immediately clear how Trump or the White House had calculated those numbers; a handout listing the tariffs said it included \u201ccurrency manipulation and trade barriers.\u201d",
      "U.S. stock markets sharply reversed earlier gains as Trump made his remarks. In after-hours trading, S&P 500 futures fell 1.5%.",
      "America has been \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered,\u201d Trump said in announcing the latest iteration of his tariff regime set to begin this week. He said from the White House Rose Garden that American industry \u201cwill be reborn\u201d and touted a new \u201cgolden age of America.\u201d",
      "The context: The announcement is an effort to impose sweeping changes on decades-old trading arrangements under which the United States increasingly outsource some labor-intensive manufacturing to foreign countries in return for cheaper goods \u2014 at the cost, critics have said, of America\u2019s industrial base.",
      "The tariffs are expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains, which could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins. The White House and its surrogates have tried to communicate a message of patience and endurance, warning that some pain will be ahead but that the trade-off would be worthwhile eventually.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how that will play with the American public, especially after Trump came into office with promises of stable or even lower prices after an inflation-heavy recovery under President Joe Biden following the vast economic disruptions of the pandemic.",
      "Zooming out on the stock market: Rob also notes that after an initial burst in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory in November, stocks have shifted downward as investors began to digest that Trump was planning to make good on significantly increasing trade duties.",
      "How Congress is responding: Four Senate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine; Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 are expected to vote for a Democratic resolution to block Trump\u2019s Canadian tariffs, Frank Thorp V, Scott Wong and Sahil Kapur report.",
      "If all 47 Senate Democrats also support it, the measure would have enough votes to pass through the upper chamber, though it wouldn\u2019t go anywhere in the House. Trump called out those four GOP senators by name on Truth Social.",

      "Republicans aren\u2019t panicking about Trump or Elon Musk after Tuesday\u2019s elections",
      "Republicans say they\u2019re not panicking as they gear up for major races this year and a fierce battle for control of Congress next year, despite getting shellacked in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \u2014 and seeing their margins decrease notably in a pair of House special election wins in deep-red Florida districts.",
      "Democrats have largely cast the 10-point win by the liberal candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race\u00a0Tuesday as a rejection by voters of Elon Musk, the billionaire White House adviser who took on a starring role in the campaign. And while the two wins by GOP candidates in Florida gave the party some breathing room with its narrow House majority, the sizes of their victories paled in comparison which what Republicans enjoyed in those districts five months ago.",
      "Republicans, however, downplayed the results as expected outcomes \u2014 criticizing some of the GOP candidates, discounting the prospect of any broader fallout from the heavy-handed role Musk played in Wisconsin and suggesting that their candidates do a better job doubling down on explaining to voters Trump\u2019s accomplishments, including divisive ones like his Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Democrats found some early success demonizing Musk in the Wisconsin race and believe they can expand that strategy. But while Musk will \u201ccontinue to be active\u201d in GOP campaigns, his prominent role in the party may be about to change: Trump told members of his Cabinet on March 24, more than a week before Tuesday\u2019s elections, that Musk would leave his government role in the coming months.",

He will find European leaders who are increasingly anxious about continued support from the military alliance\u2019s most dominant member and resentful of the Trump White House.",
      "Several episodes in recent weeks underscore the challenges Rubio will face. Vice President JD Vance\u2019s and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s recent criticisms revealed in a leaked Signal chat immediately reverberated around European capitals. Western diplomats have told me they are further aggrieved by what they see as Trump and Vance\u2019s ambush of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in the Oval Office. And there are concerns over the recent negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, notably including the latest U.S. draft of an agreement that would require Ukraine to sign over not only its minerals but also its oil and gas rights to a Delaware-based fund that the United States would control \u2014 limiting Ukraine\u2019s access to other financing for reconstruction after the war.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister will be in Brussels meeting with NATO ministers and the secretary general but is not scheduled to meet with Rubio as negotiations with the United States are on hold pending an anticipated call Trump has said he will soon have with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "While the U.S. goal at NATO is to further press allies to contribute more to mutual defense, European ministers are focusing on how to go it alone without the United States if necessary by creating a European security force for Ukraine. Poland and Germany have suggested trying to obtain nuclear weapons should Trump withdraw from NATO entirely.",
      "Those tensions will only be exacerbated by Trump\u2019s new tariffs. And then there\u2019s Canada\u2019s furor over Trump\u2019s insistence that it become America\u2019s 51st state, even though that will never happen.",
      "Finally, in the category of \u201cmanifest destiny,\u201d Trump refused to rule out taking Greenland \u2014 a territory owned by Denmark, a NATO ally \u2014 by force in his comments to Kristen Welker last Sunday.",

      "\u201cFertilization,\u201d Trump said at a White House event on March 26 to commemorate Women\u2019s History Month. \u201cI\u2019m still very proud of it, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll be known as the fertilization president and that\u2019s OK.\u201d",
      "But Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a nonprofit group for reproductive health, said one of Trump\u2019s best assets to address IVF was now gone.",
      "\u201cThis is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,\u201d Collura said. \u201cThese are the right people to have at your side.\u201d",
      "Aaron Levine, a professor of public policy at Georgia Tech who has worked with the CDC team over the last decade, called it an \u201cimmediate loss\u201d for patients who want to make a well-informed decision.",
      "\u201cThe data was produced at the clinic level every year, so you could say, \u2018Is this clinic successful 15% of the time, 20% of the time, 25% of the time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can imagine that is super valuable information for patients considering IVF, or maybe considering IVF at multiple clinics, and trying to make their choices.\u201d",
      "Dr. Brian Levine, founding partner and practice director of CCRM Fertility of New York, said about 1 in 6 people experience infertility both globally and in the U.S.",
      "IVF was first used in the 1970s. It involves combining eggs and sperm in the lab to create embryos. Those embryos are then implanted in a woman\u2019s uterus.",
      "IVF is the most common type of infertility treatment in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than 8 million babies have been born via IVF since 1978, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The success rate varies, with age being the strongest factor. Women younger than 35 have a success rate of around 46%, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That drops to 22% for women at age 38.",
      "Patients deserve to know the success rates of each clinic, and the elimination of the CDC group gives them one less resource, Brian Levine said.",
      "\u201cPatients are highly motivated for treatments because they want a family, but they\u2019re also walking in a state of sometimes despair,\u201d he said.",
      "Knowing the success rates also helps keep clinics accountable, forcing them to make changes that could help improve the quality of care.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a pervasive disease like this, it gives a lot of women angst,\u201d Brian Levine said, referring to infertility. \u201cWe typically report to the CDC, so I know that my colleagues across the country are practicing to the same standards.\u201d",
      "A 'tremendous resource'",
      "The Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team was mandated by Congress in 1992. It worked under the CDC\u2019s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted Tuesday.",
      "The team was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF, including whether women gave birth to multiples or delivered prematurely, to ensure both the safety and success of the procedure.",
      "It also provided tools to the public, including an \u201cIVF success estimator\u201d that allowed people to plug in information about themselves and get an estimate of how well IVF would work. People could also look up each individual clinic\u2019s success rates across the U.S.",
      "It also did research on different IVF topics, including how to make it more efficient with fewer side effects, and how to make the extremely expensive procedure more accessible.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a tremendous resource within the government,\u201d Collura said. \u201cThey\u2019re also public-facing. All the content is on the CDC website; they\u2019re putting out all the information for patients.\u201d",
      "\u201cI rely on their information and their data to do my work,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s going to look like now going forward.\u201d",
      "One CDC worker on the team who was terminated Tuesday tried to reconcile Trump\u2019s comments on IVF and the mass layoffs.",
      "The worker, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said the group was preparing to publish new data on the success rates of IVF across states, but now that work has stopped indefinitely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me,\u201d the worker said. \u201cPresident Trump said he was the fertility president. How does cutting this program support that?\u201d",
      "An official at the Department of Health and Human Services said that \u201cthe work will continue\u201d \u2014 although they didn\u2019t provide details on how or when the administration would continue to track and collect data on IVF.",
      "\u201cWe are focused on implementing and bringing Secretary Kennedy\u2019s high-level vision of HHS\u2019 transformation to life,\u201d the official said in. an emailed statement. \u201cThe Department is mapping out what each of the 15 redefined divisions will look like at a detailed level and will share more information soon.\u201d",
      "Aaron Levine, of Georgia Tech, noted that there are other groups that track IVF outcomes, such as the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, a professional group, although the data appears to be more limited.",
      "In a statement, Micah Hill, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, called the cuts to the IVF group\u00a0 \u201cdangerous and devastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe depth of expertise held by CDC personnel will be difficult to replace,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIn many ways, the American public health system has been the global leader, and we are now in danger of throwing that away and doing so in a manner that may be very difficult to recover from.\u201d"

      "Republicans say they\u2019re not panicking as they gear up for major races later this year and a fierce battle for control of Congress next year, despite getting shellacked in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \u2014 and seeing their margins decrease notably in a pair of special House election wins in deep-red Florida districts.",
      "Democrats have largely cast the 10-point win by the liberal candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race on Tuesday as a rejection by voters of Elon Musk, the billionaire White House adviser who took on a starring role in the campaign. And while the two wins by GOP candidates in Florida gave the party some breathing room with their narrow House majority, the size of their victories paled in comparison to what Republicans enjoyed in those districts five months ago.",
      "Republicans, however, downplayed the results as expected outcomes \u2014 criticizing some of the Republican candidates, discounting the prospect of any broader fallout from the heavy-handed role Musk played in Wisconsin, and suggesting that their candidates do a better job doubling down on explaining to voters Trump\u2019s accomplishments, including divisive ones like his Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "They\u2019re also focused on how to get the voters who put Trump over the top in 2024 to come out for other elections and candidates.",
      "Democrats have found some early success demonizing Musk in the Wisconsin race and believe they can expand that strategy. But while Musk will \u201ccontinue to be active\u201d in GOP campaigns, his prominent role in the party may be about to change: Trump told members of his Cabinet on March 24, more than a week before Tuesday\u2019s elections, that Musk would leave his government role in the administration in the coming months.",
      "\u201cI think a spring, off-year election with the deck stacked against you isn\u2019t necessarily a fair analysis of Musk\u2019s impact,\u201d said one Virginia-based Republican strategist about whether the party would be wise to draw conclusions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.",
      "National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said in a Tuesday night statement that Democrats \u201cset their cash ablaze\u201d in the deep-red Florida districts.",
      "\u201cFlorida\u2019s resounding Republican victories send a clear message: Americans are fired up to elect leaders who will fight for President Trump\u2019s agenda and reject the Democrats\u2019 failed policies,\u201d Marinella said.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Musk\u2019s presence in his state was a net-positive: \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt, he just helped,\u201d Johnson said of the recent race.",
      "And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis swept aside the idea of the closer margins in Florida\u2019s 6th Congressional District generating any broader concerns for the party. DeSantis blamed Republican Randy Fine\u2019s 12-point margin \u2014 down from 30-plus points for Trump in the district last year \u2014 on Fine himself, saying the state legislator, with whom DeSantis has clashed in the past, was a lackluster candidate.",
      "\u201cHe repels people,\u201d DeSantis said of Fine, adding that it \u201cwas unique problems with this candidate that was causing this to be a close race.\u201d",
      "Overall, said Jeanette Hoffman, a GOP strategist from New Jersey, which will host a gubernatorial race later this year, \u201cI\u2019m not seeing huge warning signs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m seeing status quo in these elections, and I think Republicans need to focus on running excellent local campaigns based on local issues and making sure their voters turn out in November,\u201d Hoffman continued.",
      "Democrats believe Tuesday\u2019s results show that their party has momentum ahead of this year\u2019s governor\u2019s races in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as next year\u2019s midterms more broadly. The Republican Senate majority looks well-defended, but Democrats need to net just five seats to flip the House.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are running scared,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., told NBC News. \u201cAnd they should be, because they\u2019re not listening to American people. Their agenda is not popular.\u201d",
      "Musk effect",
      "Democrats are also signaling they believe Musk could be an effective boogeyman for the party moving forward.",
      "\u201cIn this short period of time since the last election, we saw in these Florida elections, these bright red districts, the margins cut more than in half. And it\u2019s because folks are rejecting the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "Sam Newton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association, made it clear that the party was preparing to make the 2025 gubernatorial races about Musk and Trump, largely by charging DOGE with ruining lives by taking away government jobs and funding \u2014 a uniquely salient message in Virginia, which is home to more than 340,000 federal workers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of the DOGE effort is having the largest negative impacts,\u201d Newton said. He added that it wouldn\u2019t matter whether Musk left the administration imminently \u2014 or even curtailed his spending in the races later this year.",
      "\u201cThey can try to run from Elon Musk, but it\u2019s too late,\u201d he said.",
      "Republicans in Virginia, however, dismissed those warning shots, forecasting that the party would do more to further build the identity of the main Republican candidate in the race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "\u201cVirginia voters are smart enough to understand that they\u2019re electing a governor,\u201d said another GOP operative in the state. \u201cThey understand who is on the ballot: It\u2019s not Elon Musk. It\u2019s not anybody in the federal government. It\u2019s going to be [Democratic candidate] Abigail Spanberger and Winsome Sears.\u201d",
      "But Ed Rollins, a longtime GOP operative who is running a super PAC supporting conservative radio host Bill Spadea in the New Jersey governor\u2019s race, suggested Musk may be better suited as a traditional billionaire political benefactor for GOP campaigns than as a top surrogate.",
      "\u201dMy preference would be to have his millions of dollars to spend and have him send a check. I don\u2019t think he wants to campaign anymore than he already has. It\u2019s kind of a novelty for him,\u201d said Rollins.",
      "\u201cCampaigning is a whole different perspective and you\u2019ve got to move away from the sideshows,\u201d Rollins later added. \u201cAnd he was a sideshow obviously in Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "Focus on turnout",
      "Some Republicans did say that Tuesday\u2019s results showed that the GOP faces a persistent challenge in turning out Trump voters when the president is not on the ballot.",
      "\u201cSpecial elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,\u201d conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote on X Tuesday night, after referring to the party\u2019s reliance on more sporadic voters.",
      "\u201cThe base that came out to support Donald Trump during the presidential election, a lot of those voters stayed home,\u201d said Hoffman, the New Jersey GOP strategist. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to see a much lower turnout in the New Jersey governor\u2019s race than we did in the presidential race last year. So both parties really need to look at getting their base out and making sure their turnout operation\u2019s top notch.\u201d",
      "Hoffman said that turnout effort will hinge on affordability-focused messaging, with a high cost of living being the top issue in the high-tax state of New Jersey. She noted that Trump\u2019s involvement in the race \u201cwould certainly help to bring out the Republican base.\u201d",
      "Two of the top candidates in the New Jersey race \u2014 Spadea and former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarellii \u2014 have closely aligned with Trump, both meeting with the president last month at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club.",
      "One of the GOP candidates, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, has been more critical of the president generally. But he did not see Tuesday\u2019s results as signs that aligning with Trump is a problematic strategy.",
      "\u201cNovember is not going to be based on who you\u2019re with, who you like, who likes you. It\u2019s going to be: Are people tired of one-party rule in Trenton? I think the Democrats are very, very nervous in that regard, and they probably should be,\u201d Bramnick said.",
      "The two Virginia Republican operatives who said the path to victory for the GOP candidate in the race would rely on her ability to tie herself closely to Trump and to the state\u2019s popular Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited.",
      "\u201cYou need to make certain that you\u2019re locking arms with the president because he\u2019s seized the mantle of common sense \u2014 that\u2019s really powerful, and you need to lean back into that,\u201d said one of the operatives.",
      "Turning out those Trump voters will also be key for Republicans looking to hold onto control of Congress in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the Senate. Just one GOP senator, Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in November, so Democrats will be targeting some seats in states Trump won.",
      "Democrats will also have to reach into Trump territory to net the five seats they need to flip the House. While Democrats have plenty of ripe targets in districts that were decided by close margins last year, DelBene demurred on whether Tuesday\u2019s results show that redder districts are in play.",
      "\u201cOur job and our focus is making sure we take back the majority in the House. It still is, and we are going to be playing in districts across the country to make sure we win,\u201d DelBene said."

      "For now, the couple is simply enjoying each other\u2019s company and preparing to celebrate their fourth dating anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cNot only do I like her personality, but she\u2019s as sweet as all my favorite desserts, and she\u2019s pretty and funny and smart and beautiful and lovely at the same time,\u201d David says of his girlfriend.",
      "It\u2019s an exciting time for the lovebirds, who first met while appearing on \u201cLove on the Spectrum,\u201d a Netflix series that follows the dating lives of people on the autism spectrum.",
      "When the show returns for its third season on April 2, viewers will see more of Abbey and David\u2019s blossoming romance and catch up with other series regulars, including Dani Bowman, Ad\u00e1n Correa, Connor Tomlinson, Tanner Smith and James Jones. They\u2019ll also get to know two new faces this season: Madison Marilla and Pari Kim.",
      "Since they\u2019re fan favorites of the show, Abbey and David often get recognized in public. \u201cI have fans wherever I go,\u201d Abbey notes.",
      "It\u2019s a far cry from how Abbey used to feel in her childhood. \u201cI used to feel isolated and alone as a kid, and I had a lot less language. Autism affected me more when I was a kid. It can affect me still, even as an adult woman. It affects me a little bit, but not a lot,\u201d she says.",
      "If you\u2019ve followed Abbey and David\u2019s journey, you know their love seemed destined from their very first date, when they visited a wildlife learning center in their home state of California. They soon realized they share a love of lions, and a relationship blossomed from there.",
      "When asked why they both admire the king of the jungle so much, the couple is on the same page. Abbey declares, \u201cThey\u2019re brave, and I like being brave.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs an adult woman, I feel accepted for who I am now these days. Before, I felt lonely and left out,\u201d Abbey explains.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control define autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a \u201cdevelopmental disability caused by differences in the brain.\u201d As \u201cLove on the Spectrum\u201d shows, each person experiences autism in a different way, with subtle differences in their ability to communicate, interact and learn.",
      "While growing up, Abbey encountered challenges with communication.",
      "\u201cThe type of autism I have is called autism communication disorder,\u201d she explains. \u201c(It took) 22 years of speech therapy, 15 years of occupational therapy to get where I am today to be able to talk just like this.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David has synesthesia, which the Cleveland Clinic defines as a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s learning my synesthesia by seeing numbers as colors,\u201d David explains as he demonstrates how he associates each number with a color.",
      "Abbey says David also supports her, especially when she encounters unwelcome noises.",
      "\u201cWhen I hear a certain noise, like a baby crying, it really hurts my ears. I have auditory issues,\u201d she says then asks David what he tells her whenever a baby cries near her.",
      "\u201cJust ignore it and keep a distance. You need to remember you must use the noise canceling headsets,\u201d David replies.",
      "\u201cOr you can cover my ears because I don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d Abbey adds.",
      "After nearly four years of dating, Abbey and David have developed some simple yet solid tips for keeping a romance alive.",
      "\u201cThe secret to a good relationship is that we understand each other (and) the way our minds work. We\u2019re kind and patient with each other and we\u2019re our true selves,\u201d Abbey says.",
      "David agrees and adds his own advice, saying, \u201cThe secret to a great relationship is have confidence, gather your courage and be yourself and care for others too.\u201d",
      "The couple has become friends with several other previous stars of \u201cLove on the Spectrum,\u201d including Subodh Garg and Devin Morrissey, and they have some pretty wise advice for anyone else with autism who\u2019s looking for love.",
      "\u201cGive someone a gift to remember them by,\u201d David suggests. \u201cThey must feel confident. Gather their courage and be themselves by caring for others.\u201d",
      "In the end, Abbey says, it all boils down to connecting with the person you\u2019re meeting for the first time.",
      "\u201cYou have to date someone who you have things in common with, same interests or similar interests,\u201d she says.",
      "Abbey and David have plenty in common, like their love for lions and pizza, and they enjoy going on lunch dates together.",
      "\u201cShe makes me feel much better when we\u2019re together,\u201d David says.",
      "In the new season of \u201cLove on the Spectrum,\u201d Abbey sings a beautiful song she wrote for David. When asked what inspired her to share her feelings in a song, Abbey says, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve always wanted a boyfriend and now I\u2019ve got one.\u201d",
      "While reflecting on the romantic moment, David says it was a special moment.",
      "\u201cIt was very special, what I did for him. And he\u2019s special with me,\u201d Abbey says.",
      "If \u201cLove on the Spectrum\u201d gets renewed for Season 4, the lovebirds would be excited to return for another batch of episodes.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d Abbey says."

      "Country artist Tanner Adell thought she had her adoption story figured out, but a surprise DNA match unraveled everything, ultimately leading to a very personal song.",
      "Adell, who was adopted and raised in Manhattan Beach, California, opened up about her early life in a raw and tearful three-part post shared to Instagram on March 23.",
      "In the posts, the singer details the twists, heartache, and journey to healing behind her discovery. Adell began her first post, sharing that she grew up with other adopted siblings, and on one Christmas, they each received Ancestry DNA kits.",
      "While initially Adell's DNA didn't result in meaningful family connections, years later, she received an unexpected email from Ancestry. It notified her of a message from someone she refers to as \"Joe\" for the sake of anonymity.",
      "Then came Joe's message: \u201cHey, my name is Joe, and I think you\u2019re my sister.\u201d",
      "By this point, outside of her Ancestry DNA testing, Adell had learned that her adopted parents suspected Adell had been the result of an affair her birth mother had outside of her marriage at the time.",
      "\"So it wasn\u2019t like absolutely shocking to see a message like that. I just was like, Oh, yeah. Like, I remember hearing that I had like half-siblings out there,\u201d she explains in her second post.",
      "When she and Joe got to speak for the first time they hit it off instantly. The two exchanged photos and compared physical traits, finding that they not only had the same shape of hands and ears but also shared a freckle on their legs. But as they kept talking, they realized their DNA confirmed they had a deeper tie than expected. They were full biological siblings.",
      "Adell and Joe pieced together that in addition to having the same birth mother, they shared the same father: Adell\u2019s biological father was Adell\u2019s birth mother\u2019s husband. The discovery unraveled years of assumptions and stunned them both.",
      "\"We just kind of sat there, and it's really all a blur, but we realized that we were full siblings,\" she explained. \"Somehow, we assumed that my birth mother must have already been pregnant with me by her husband before she had an affair and mistakenly assumed that I must have been from this other man.\"",
      "\"My first question was, 'Does she know that you found me? Do you think she knows that we're actually full siblings, that she didn't need to give me away?'\"",
      "Adell sobs in the video as she describes how Joe then shared that her biological mother had died five years earlier.",
      "\"I just asked for pictures,\" she tearfully recalled. \"And he sent me this picture and my jaw dropped at how beautiful she was. I immediately said, 'She looks like Dolly Parton.'... he said 'She got that all the time.'\"",
      "In her search for a connection to a mother she never knew beyond the stories her brother could tell her, Adell dove into everything related to the famous country music icon, known well for her blonde image but even more so for her larger-than-life persona and vocal chords. Eventually, Adell came across the singer's 1967 breakout song \"Dumb Blonde.\"",
      "The song became a link for Adell, tying together her mother\u2019s frequent comparisons to Dolly Parton with what had long been, for her, a mystery \u2014 why her naturally brown hair would turn blonde in the sun.",
      "\u201cI started to realize how blonde hair felt like protection from my mom. It felt like she\u2019s there with me,\u201d she continued in her third post. \u201cAnd that was when I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going blonde.\u2019 I made my first-ever hair coloring appointment and I got my hair done.\u201d",
      "Over time, lyrics for Adell\u2019s latest song \u201cGoing Blonde\u201d came to mind. The singer\u2019s chorus weaves in the emotional core of Adell\u2019s journey.",
      "\"I\u2019m goin\u2019 blonde and I\u2019m never goin\u2019 back/ Yeah, blonde like the mama that I never had/ She knew what she wanted, she\u2019d give you hell/ She was flirty and gorgeous, but tough\u0435r than nails.\"",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would ever want anyone to hear it, but I\u2019m realizing that there\u2019s a lot of people that have lost someone and try to keep anything of them close... and that\u2019s really what this song is about,\u201d she shared.",
      "Those words became a way for Adell to honor herself as well as the mother she never knew.",
      "Last Friday, on April 28, four years after she learned about her birth mother, Adell's \u201cGoing Blonde\u201d was officially released.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019m ready. I want people to know you\u2019re not alone, and it\u2019s okay \u2014 it\u2019s okay to grieve,\u201d she concluded her post."

      "\u201cI was 7 years old and all of a sudden, Kristine just tried to convince me that I was having my period. Kristine literally just said, \u2018You started your period,\u2019 and she forced me to put the tampon in, and I literally just told her, \u2018I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t do it, it hurts,\u2019\u201d Grace says. \u201cI remember Kristine being mad because I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

      "Did the Barnetts change Natalia Grace\u2019s legal age?",
      "According to an affidavit for probable cause filed by the state of Indiana in 2019, the Barnetts legally changed Grace\u2019s age birth certificate to say she was born in 1989, aging her up from 8 to 22, in June of 2012.",
      "The couple rented an Indiana apartment for Grace to live in on her own starting in July of 2013, according to the affidavit. Afterward, the couple moved to Canada with their three biological children. Kristine Barnett instructed Grace to tell people she was actually 22 years old, per the affidavit.",
      "According to the affidavit, the couple was aware that doctors at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital had determined Grace was a minor in 2012.",
      "In 2019,\u00a0the Barnetts were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent\u00a0and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent. Michael Barnett was acquitted of his charges after a jury trial in 2022 and the charges against his wife were dismissed.",
      "What did Natalia Grace say about her age?",
      "Grace has always maintained that she was a young child when she was adopted, and has said Kristine Barnett forced her to lie about being an adult.",
      "\u201cI was terrified of her. I was terrified, so when Kristine told me to tell people that I was 22, I listened because I didn\u2019t know what she would have me do. I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary. \u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad.\u201d",
      "In the documentary, Grace also says she was initially unaware that the Barnetts had filed a court motion to charge her legal birthdate from 2003 to 1989. Grace says these legal proceedings took place after the Barnetts sent her away to Larue Carter Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Indianapolis, Indiana.",
      "\u201cI did not know that Michael and Kristine were changing my age,\u201d Grace says.",
      "How old is Natalia Grace?",
      "In 2010, a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital examined Grace and determined her age was about 8, according to a 2019 affidavit filed in the Tippecanoe Court in Indiana obtained by\u00a0TODAY.com. A skeletal examination of Grace in 2012 also found that Grace was approximately 11 years old, per the affidavit.",
      "\u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace\u201d provides evidence to support that Grace is in her early 20s.",
      "In one episode, Grace is seen taking a DNA test with a company called TruDiagnostic in August 2023 to determine her true age.",
      "\u201cI just really want people to see the truth,\u201d she says.",
      "In an emotional scene, Grace is told that her DNA test results found she was about 22, meaning she was definitely a child when she was adopted by the Barnetts.",
      "\u201cThis one little piece of paper throws every single lie that the Barnetts have said right into the trash, with a match,\u201d Grace says.",
      "\u201cThis is so big because literally this has been 13 years ... of just two people lying their butts off,\u201d she also says.",
      "The documentary also includes an interview with Dr. Timothy Gossweiler, a dentist who conducted an analysis of Grace\u2019s teeth in 2011.",
      "Gossweiler shows X-rays of Grace\u2019s teeth from that examination, and he says that at the time, Grace \u201chad 12 baby teeth remaining.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is way too many baby teeth to be an adult,\u201d he says in the docuseries, adding that the X-rays offer \u201cindisputable\u201d proof that Grace was a child when the exam was performed.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fake teeth coming in like this,\u201d he says.",
      "The documentary also shows paperwork that was reportedly provided to Kristine Barnett at the time, which states that based on her dental results, Grace was estimated to be 8 or 9 years old in 2011.",
      "Today, Grace is living with Nicole\u00a0and Vincent DePaul, a New York couple with Dwarfism. The Barnetts have since divorced and moved back to the U.S., according to court filings.",

      "Now, the future looks difficult for Le Pen, 56, who was found guilty of running a \u201csystem\u201d of embezzlement that siphoned $3.4 million of European Union funds to her National Rally party.",
      "The implications are also unclear for her party and the wider European far-right movement, which has won friends in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House.",
      "Just like Trump in the United States, Le Pen has attacked the French legal system, condemning the ruling as a rigged attempt to block her from power. Those comments are a marked departure from her years of efforts to become a respected, mainstream force in European politics.",
      "The National Rally leader has vowed to appeal her five-year election ban and two-year suspended prison sentence, plus another two with an electronic ankle tag. She was among two dozen defendants from her party.",
      "But this is \u201cthe kind of obstacle you don\u2019t hop over just by a publicity campaign or ignoring it,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a French studies professor at Stanford University.",

      "Meanwhile, Trump adviser Elon Musk said it was an example of \u201cthe radical left\u201d abusing \u201cthe legal system to jail their opponents\u201d when its members can\u2019t win elections. \u201cThis is their standard playbook throughout the world,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "Trump was convicted last year of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.",

      "Far-right leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u00a0and Dutch anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders have this week voiced support for Le Pen's cause. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called it \u201ca violation of democratic norms.\u201d",
      "That Le Pen was leading the field is undeniable, after softening her party's hard-line image while retaining its staunchly anti-immigration ideology.",
      "An Ifop poll taken four days before her sentencing projected she would get 36% of the vote in 2027. The two-term Macron is ineligible for a third but his ally, \u00c9douard Philippe was second on 25%.",
      "Le Pen is far from the first high-profile French politician to face legal troubles, with former Presidents Jacques Chirac\u00a0and Nicolas Sarkozy both being convicted of corruption.",
      "If she fails in appealing her disbarment, she has a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir-apparent in Jordan Bardella, 29, the millennial darling of the far right with a bootstrap backstory of growing up with Italian-Algerian heritage in Paris' grittier suburbs.",
      "With 2 million TikTok followers, he became the party\u2019s president at 26 and its first not born a Le Pen. He is deeply loyal, and was poised to become Le Pen's prime minister if she won in 2027.",
      "But his mentor's conviction \u201cmight lead to a change in plans,\u201d according to Tara Varma, a visiting fellow at Washington\u2019s Brookings Institution think tank.",
      "Le Pen acknowledged as much in an interview with French television Tuesday, saying Bardella might have to be deployed to run for the top job \u201csooner than necessary.\u201d",
      "A survey by the pollster Harris Interactive the day of Le Pen's sentencing put her and Bardella's popularity on equal footing, but his rise is not a fait accompli, analysts say.",
      "\u201cA lot of internal fights are likely to emerge,\u201d said Alduy at Stanford. And Bardella\u2019s \u201cleadership will be put into question by Marine\u2019s allies.\u201d",

      "Another potential successor is Le Pen\u2019s niece, Marion Mar\u00e9chal, who dropped the family name in 2018. Some commentators said that was an attempt to distance herself from her late grandfather and Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, though she denied it.",
      "The senior Le Pen founded the National Front, as National Rally was then known, but his daughter later kicked him out in her own attempt to distance the party from his record of racist remarks and Holocaust denial.",
      "Mar\u00e9chal still \u201ccarries the Le Pen name\u201d in spirit at least, said Varma, and would continue a lineage unbroken since the 1970s.",
      "Ultimately, the only certain outcome from this week's events for French politics is more drama.",
      "After inconclusive snap elections last year, Macron has cobbled together a fragile coalition which could soon face fresh no-confidence votes from Le Pen, who is still a lawmaker, Alduy said.",
      "Another governmental collapse \u2014 there were two last year \u2014 is not impossible. If that happens, Alduy added, \u201cmore chaos is certainly in store on all sides.\u201d"

      "The evacuation orders appeared to cover nearly all of the city and nearby areas. The military ordered Palestinians to head to Muwasi, a sprawl of squalid tent camps along the coast. The orders came during\u00a0Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive Muslim holiday\u00a0marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.",
      "The order came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated a demand on Sunday for Hamas to disarm and for its leaders to leave Gaza as he promised to\u00a0step up pressure\u00a0on the group\u00a0while continuing\u00a0efforts\u00a0to\u00a0return\u00a0hostages.",

      "Senior\u00a0Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Netanyahu\u2019s comments were a recipe for \u201cendless escalation\u201d in the region.",
      "Netanyahu rejected assertions that Israel, which has resumed its\u00a0bombardment of Gaza\u00a0after a two-month truce and sent troops back into the enclave, was not negotiating, saying \u201cwe are conducting it under fire, and therefore it is also effective\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe see that there are suddenly cracks,\u201d he said in a video statement issued on Sunday.",
      "On Saturday,\u00a0Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group\u00a0had agreed to a\u00a0proposal\u00a0that security sources said included the release of five Israeli hostages each week.\u00a0But he said\u00a0laying down its arms as Israel has demanded\u00a0was a \u201cred line\u201d the group would not cross.",

      "Since Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate areas in northern Gaza where they had returned following the ceasefire agreement in January.",
      "Netanyahu said Israel was demanding that Hamas lay down its arms and said its leaders would be allowed to leave Gaza. He gave no detail on how long Israeli troops would remain in the enclave but repeated that Hamas\u2019s\u00a0military and government capacities must be crushed.",
      "\u201cWe will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary emigration plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the plan, we do not hide it, we are ready to discuss it at any time.\u201d",
      "Trump originally proposed moving the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza to countries including Egypt and Jordan and developing the Gaza Strip as a U.S.-owned\u00a0resort. However, no country has agreed to take in the population and Israel has since said that any departures by Palestinians would be voluntary.",

      "\u201cIn Gaza, our situation is very difficult. Other people are celebrating these rituals in peace and safety, but we do them amid destruction and bombardment,\u201d she said.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu has faced a wave of demonstrations since the military resumed its action in Gaza, with families and supporters of the remaining 59 hostages joining forces with\u00a0protesters\u00a0angry at government actions they see as undermining Israeli democracy.",

      "Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor working at Brown University's medical center was sent home despite having a valid U.S. visa after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching her phone found photos and videos they said were \u201csympathetic\u201d to the former leader of the Hezbollah militant group, whose funeral she told agents she attended last month.",

      "But many of the cases in recent weeks have involved travelers from countries such as France, Germany and Canada \u2014 longtime allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence, has frequent cultural exchanges and does hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. Several of those held have spoken out about being scrutinized and sometimes locked up for days at the border.",
      "Last week, France\u2019s interior minister said a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents after they found messages on his phone criticizing the Trump administration. The CBP said searches of the researcher's electronic media devices \u2014 they have not been named by the French authorities \u2014 led to the \u201cdiscovery of proprietary information\u201d from a U.S. laboratory.",

      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

      "\u201cVery few manufacturers can do what we do,\u201d she said in an interview Monday at an auto parts show in Beijing that drew 1,200 Chinese suppliers. \u201cOr make as many types.\u201d",
      "Zhang said she would consider absorbing up to 15% of the new tariffs but only if her U.S. clients made bigger orders.",
      "\u201cIf they want to keep doing the business (with us), they\u2019ll have to absorb it and maybe increase their own price to consumers,\u201d she said.",
      "Though Chinese-made vehicles are not widely sold in the U.S., China is crucial to the American aftermarket, which serves customers looking to fix their own vehicles.",
      "Auto parts stores such as AutoZone, O\u2019Reilly and NAPA count on Chinese suppliers with their flexible production lines and cheaper labor to provide a broad range of parts at low cost \u2014 requirements not easily replaced by other countries.",
      "\u201cFor Ford, GM, Toyota, BMW, every car that\u2019s sold in the United States, you\u2019re going to want parts for that,\u201d said Jack Perkowski, founder and managing partner of Beijing-based merchant banking firm JFP Holdings. \u201cThe Chinese have gotten very good at figuring out how to make those parts differently, and tooling costs in China tend to be a lot lower.\u201d",
      "At a booth not far from Zhang\u2019s, Gosven Zuo, who makes engine mounts for cars from Ford and General Motors, among others, said he was paying no more than 5% out of the 45% in U.S. tariffs.",
      "His U.S. buyers have absorbed most of the cost of the existing tariffs, Zuo said, though he agreed to take some of the loss when Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff in February.",
      "But the higher the tariffs go, the harder it becomes to push off the cost.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have much room to compromise anymore, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a manufacturer, we don\u2019t have high margins.\u201d",
      "Zuo, who sells about 30% of his products to Americans, is trying to expand to new markets, looking for more buyers at home in China as well as in Europe and the Middle East.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s partially because of the tariffs, but also what we need to do to survive as a factory,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we know is we can\u2019t take orders that make us lose money.\u201d",
      "While Trump says his tariffs will drive manufacturing from countries such as China back to the U.S., Zuo and others say that is unlikely.",
      "\u201cI have dozens of suppliers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic to move them all to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Zhang also said she had no plans to avoid the tariffs by moving production to the U.S., especially when there is so much uncertainty around Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t a big company,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford setting up an\u00a0American factory. The cost is too much.\u201d",

      "As of late Wednesday local time, the death toll from the tremor had climbed above 3,000, Chinese state television station CCTV reported, according to Reuters.",

      "Originating in ancient Egypt, scarabs were commonly used as seals and as amulets and were designed in the shape of a dung beetles. \u201cThis beetle, considered sacred in the eyes of the ancient Egyptians, was a symbol of new life, because of the dung ball it created and then laid its eggs into it, from which new life would hatch,\u201d the Facebook post said.",

      "Antonello Lovato, 39, has been accused of abandoning the injured and bleeding Satnam Singh, 31, and failing to call an ambulance following the incident in Latina, a largely agricultural province south of Rome, on June 17, 2024. Prosecutors originally considered charging Lovato with manslaughter, but raised it to murder with malice after the fact since he was aware the actions could cause death.",
      "At the opening of his murder trial on Tuesday, Lovato said that \u201che lost his head,\u2019\u201d when he saw Singh, who was working in the country illegally, bleeding. \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself. I didn\u2019t want him to die,\u201d he was cited by the news agency ANSA as saying.",

It is a mistake to think this problem can be resolved with this trial. We are worried because the season is starting again.\u201d",

      "Compact spy cameras, microdots in a talcum powder tin and a briefcase abandoned by fleeing Soviet spy Guy Burgess are also part of the show at Britain\u2019s National Archives, which charts the history of a secretive agency that is \u2014 slowly \u2014 becoming more open.",
      "MI5 Director General Ken McCallum told journalists at a preview on Tuesday that the organization\u2019s work \u201cis often different from fiction, whether that fiction is George Smiley or Jackson Lamb\u201d \u2014 the brilliant spymaster of John le Carre\u2019s novels and the slovenly supervisor of MI5 rejects in Mick Herron\u2019s \u201cSlow Horses\u201d series.",
      "Many stories told in the exhibition, however, would not be out of place in a thriller.",
      "The lemon, now black and shriveled, helped convict Karl Muller, a German spy in Britain during World War I. It was found by police in his bedside table, along with another in his overcoat pocket. Evidence at his secret trial showed their juice had been used to write invisible-ink letters detailing British troop movements.",
      "Muller was executed by firing squad at the Tower of London in 1915.",
      "In a coda that would not be out of place in \u201cSlow Horses,\u201d MI5 pretended Muller was still alive and wrote to his German handlers to ask for more money.",

      "Failures include the years-long betrayal of the upper-crust \u201cCambridge Spies,\u201d whose members spilled secrets to the Soviet Union from the heart of the U.K. intelligence establishment. Recently declassified MI5 documents on display include the 1963 confession of Cambridge spy Kim Philby, who denied treachery for years before he was exposed and fled to Moscow.",

      "There are admissions of past mistakes. The exhibition notes that MI5 was slow to recognize the threat from fascism in the 1930s, and later spent too much time spying on the small Communist Party of Great Britain. MI5 didn\u2019t need to break into the party\u2019s offices \u2014 it had a key, which is on display.",
      "There are only a few items from the past few decades, showing how MI5\u2019s focus has shifted from counterespionage to counterterrorism. Displays include a mortar shell fired by the Irish Republican Army at 10 Downing St. in 1991 while Prime Minister John Major was holding a Cabinet meeting.",
      "MI5 only began releasing records to the U.K.\u2019s public archives in 1997, generally 50 years after the events have passed. Even now, it controls what to release and what to keep secret.",
      "\u201cIt would be a mistake to assume everything is in the exhibition,\u201d said author Ben Macintyre, whose books on the history of intelligence include \u201cOperation Mincemeat\u201d and \u201cAgent Zigzag.\u201d But he said it still marks \u201ca real sea-change in official secrecy.\u201d",
