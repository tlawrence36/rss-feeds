      "The annual AFI Life Achievement Award presentation is always a starry night in Hollywood, but Saturday\u2019s ceremony at the Dolby Theatre brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema to honor Francis Ford Coppola",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most classic films of the late 1970s and 1980s",
      "\u201cMe love you long time,\u201d a Vietnamese sex worker tells the U.S. troops, swiveling her hips as she hawks her services. \u201cYou party?\u201d The first female character in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam War classic \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d she appears for just a moment \u2014 and halfway through the film.",
      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously.",
      "Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party.",

      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",
      "The Welsh soccer team's remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high \u2014 returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.",
      "It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team.",
      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job.

      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",

      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",

      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",

Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements began Wednesday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s rape retrial, five years after his original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful figures.",
      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",
      "The retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the first trial, and two accusers who testified then are expected to return.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first, which happened during the height of the #MeToo movement. Along with the charges being retried, he faces an additional allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t involved in the first case.",
      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.

They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version.

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",

      "Opening statements are set in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements are set for Wednesday in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case.",
      "After a dayslong selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors by Monday, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can\u2019t see the trial through.",
      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",
      "But in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York\u2019s highest court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge\u2019s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Drawn from Manhattan\u2019s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.",
      "One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master\u2019s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.",
      "Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein \u2014 \u201cthe first word that came in my head was \u2018pig,\u2019\u201d said one man who was soon let go.",
      "Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.",
      "\u201cYou may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\u201d defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",
      "Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think, \u2018OK, that\u2019s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I\u2019m deciding this case\u2019? Everyone can put that aside?\u201d Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn\u2019t part of the original trial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is challenging a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "San Francisco has moved closer to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",
      "Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.",
      "But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.",
      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",
      "Brendan Harris, who said he has been clean for six years, countered that harm reduction tactics cannot go on forever and people need a firm if compassionate push into treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep enabling drugs over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.",
      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",
      "As amended, Dorsey's proposal states that the \u201clong-term remission of substance use disorders for individuals, with the help of fully supported and staffed evidence-based recovery and behavioral health services, shall be the primary goal.\u201d",
      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",
      "The full Board of Supervisors votes on the proposal next month. It is expected to pass, with seven of the 11 members sponsoring or cosponsoring.",

    "story": [
      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

      "With the world awash in stress and anxiety, nature can be the perfect spring antidote",
      "HALLE, Belgium -- Gilles Gui was looking for the magical purple bluebells that raise their heads each spring under the budding beech leaves of the Hallerbos forest, an annual explosion of color that draws crowds from around the world.",
      "And in these times full of stress and anxiety about wars, economic threats and other tensions, he found something else too: a sense of tranquility.",
      "\u201cI notice that there\u2019s a lot of silence in my head when I\u2019m done,\u201d Gui said. \u201cYeah, it helps me keep some peace in my mind, really just take my mind away from everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Spending time in nature, experts have long said, can be a balm in troubled times.",
      "\u201cFrom a stroll through a city park to a day spent hiking in the wilderness, exposure to nature has been linked to a host of benefits, including improved attention, lower stress, better mood, reduced risk of psychiatric disorders, and even upticks in empathy and cooperation,\u201d a 2020 article of the American Psychological Association said.",
      "\u201cThese are extraordinary times,\u201d said Ignace Glorieux, a sociology professor at Brussels University, adding that the under-30 generation in particular is under pressure.",
      "\u201cThis is also the generation maybe that suffered most from the COVID crisis,\u201d Glorieux said. \u201cAnd now they come into a situation where there\u2019s a lot of international uncertainty. So especially this group, maybe more than (the older) generation, is suffering from that and feels very uncertain about their future.\u201d",
      "Gui, 26, knows what Glorieux is talking about. \u201cI do know of people my age who are worried and also with financial situations going on, who try to keep level heads, but it\u2019s very hard for them,\u201d he said.",
      "During the pandemic, the bluebell woods were closed off for fear that throngs of people would make it a hive of transmission instead of a haven of peace. Restrictions kept some parks under seal and mandated masks in some others.",
      "\u201cIt was a difficult period for everyone,\u201d said Mark Demesmaeker, a former member of the European Parliament, gardening enthusiast and city councilor in Halle, where he has walked the woods for decades. Now, at least, nature is there to welcome those with anxious minds.",
      "\u201cThese bluebells \u2014 but in other times of year as well, walking here, the forest valleys, the wildlife, the forest streams \u2014 you know, they work into your mind all year round. And it\u2019s really a big green hug that you get here,\u201d Demesmaeker said.",
      "That hug from nature is just about everywhere right now. Japan is awash in a sea of cherry blossoms, which mesmerize people around the world. Bluebell season also coincides with the prime tulip season in the Netherlands. The renowned Keukenhof garden there has become a playground for influencers and those seeking that ultimate selfie.",
      "The Keukenhof and the Dutch tourism board suggest good spots to \u201cmake your image come alive.\u201d",
      "To Glorieux, that's where 21st-century humans push it too far.",
      "\u201cWe have to be busy all the time, even in our leisure time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to perform.\"",
      "Instead, he advised, \u201cFocus! If you go out walking, focus on walking. If you go out jogging, focus only on jogging.\u201d",
      "Such advice was not wasted on Philippe Thiry, 64, a southern Belgian recently retired and ready to embrace the rest of his life. He had no phone as he set off in the sunshine to look for bluebells.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to use it here because I\u2019m here just to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, just to see the flowers and to see, to listen to the birds.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Novavax's closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is on track for full approval after additional discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said Wednesday.",
      "The news sent company shares soaring more than 21% in morning trading and appeared to resolve concerns that Trump administration officials might be holding up a decision on the shot.",
      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. It is still being sold under emergency use authorization \u2014 unlike mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "The FDA recently asked Novavax to develop a plan for collecting additional clinical data from those who have gotten the shot, the company said in a statement. It said it is \u201cengaging with the FDA expeditiously\u201d in hopes of receiving approval \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "At FDA, full vaccine approval is the gold standard. The agency was on track to sign off on Novavax\u2019s license by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "But FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Dr. Sara Brenner, directed the agency\u2019s lead official overseeing the vaccine to pause the decision, according to one of the people. The delay, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sparked concerns of political interference under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who spent decades leading antivaccine groups before joining the federal government as health secretary.",

      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

      "A 4-month-old gray seal named Witje swims gracefully through one of nine new tanks at the World Heritage Centre, a recently opened rescue facility in the north of the Netherlands",
      "LAUWERSOOG, Netherlands -- Gliding gracefully through the waters at his new home, Witje pauses briefly to peer through a large window at the curious and admiring visitors.",
      "The 4-month-old gray seal is a lucky survivor able to swim in one of nine new tanks at the World Heritage Center, or WEC, a recently opened seal rescue facility in Lauwersoog, in the north of the Netherlands.",
      "He was brought in after being orphaned and was suffering from a swollen flipper and a damaged eye.",
      "\u201cOn a yearly basis, we roughly treat about 200 seals,\u201d Sander van Dijk, the curator of the center, told The Associated Press. In 2024, researchers at Wageningen University in the Netherlands counted around 24,000 seals across the Wadden Sea.",
      "Most are pups who get separated from their mother, known as howlers for their plaintive wailing. Others are injured by floating debris or are struck by passing vessels.",
      "\u201cIf we look at our own data over the past 15 years, we just see every year more seals that somehow get entangled in waste in the sea, mostly fishing nets,\u201d Van Dijk said.",
      "The WEC, which officially opened to the public Saturday, replaces the Pieterburen Seal Center, a rescue facility set up in 1971 to treat injured seals found in and around the nearby Wadden Sea, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
      "Witje\u2019s tank is an upgrade from his previous quarters. He gets to swim in water directly from the sea, rather than tap water, in order to maintain a habitat as close as possible to the seals\u2019 natural environment.",
      "\u201cThey are adapted to living in seawater. It\u2019s good for their fur. But also seawater, through its salt, has some properties that makes wounds heal faster,\u201d Van Dijk said.",
      "The WEC can treat around 70 seals at a time and has 12 intensive-care units for animals with serious injuries who are able to recover in special enclosures which offer a calm environment. They are prevented from swimming in order to rest and the space is cleaned frequently to prevent infections from waste.",
      "The new building, which cost over 40 million euros ($45 million), with financing provided by local and regional governments as well as charitable organizations, tells more than just the story of the seas. It\u2019s an educational space which teaches visitors about the Wadden Sea, the largest continuous system of intertidal flats in the world, extending along the coasts of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark.",
      "The new facility is significantly closer to the sea than the previous location. The tanks for the 10 seals currently residing at WEC look out over the water. Caregivers at the center are optimistic that Witje will soon recover enough to be released back into the waves.",

    "story": [
      "Europe\u2019s plan for spending more on defense is finding previously unimaginable political backing",
      "MADRID -- Inside a sprawling hangar in Spain, workers bolt together a fuselage for European aerospace giant Airbus, which churns out jets and other military equipment.",
      "The multinational conglomerate is a rarity in Europe\u2019s defense industry, backed by Spain, Germany, France and Britain. The norm for defense industries on the continent is big-name national champions and hundreds of small companies mostly working to fill orders for state governments.",
      "That piecemeal paradigm could hinder Europe\u2019s plan for spending more on defense, which has been given a jolt \u2014 and previously unimaginable political backing \u2014 following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to not protect NATO allies in the context of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "For years, Trump has accused NATO allies of spending too little on their own defense. In recent months, the chasm in trans-Atlantic ties has grown. The Trump administration has signaled that U.S. priorities lie beyond Europe and Ukraine and that the time has come \u201cfor Europe to stand on its own feet.\u201d",
      "The shortfall in defense spending is most evident is Spain.",
      "Last year, it trailed all NATO allies in defense spending as a share of GDP, forcing the country to play catch-up this year to reach the alliance's 2% spending goal. NATO leaders are expected to again increase that goal this summer.",
      "Europe-wide, industry leaders and experts have pointed out challenges the continent must overcome to be a truly self-sufficient military power, chiefly its decades-long reliance on the U.S. as well as its fragmented defense industry.",
      "\u201cEurope procures a majority of its defense material outside of Europe, and that\u2019s really something we have to depart from,\u201d said Jean-Brice Dumont, head of air power at Airbus Defense and Space at the aircraft maker's factory outside Madrid. \u201cThe journey until we get full autonomy is a long journey, but it has to be started.\u201d",
      "The pro-defense shift in Europe can be seen in the stock markets, where major European arms makers such as BAE Systems (UK), Leonardo (Italy), Rheinmetall (Germany), Thales (France) and Saab (Sweden) have all been on the rise despite recent turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs.",
      "European companies are poised to benefit from a push by European Union policy makers to ensure that as many euros as possible end up in European companies, as opposed to flowing across the Atlantic. The challenge is daunting, but not as scary as having to face a potential military threat without American help.",
      "One question is: How quickly can production scale up?",
      "An EU white paper published last month bluntly stated that Europe\u2019s defense industry is not able to produce defense systems and equipment sufficient for what member states need. It noted where much of the bloc\u2019s spending has taken place: the U.S.",
      "Europe has relied on the U.S. not just for military equipment but also intelligence, surveillance and even software updates. Supply chain complexities mean that European-made equipment often use software or other components built and even operated by U.S. companies.",
      "Airbus\u2019 A330 MRTT air-to-air refueling plane, made outside Madrid, is an example of specialized equipment called enablers that Europe largely lacks.",
      "Another example is Sweden\u2019s Gripen fighter made by Saab, which has an engine made by American firm General Electric, noted Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher at the Stockholm Peace Research Institute who studies Europe's arms industry.",
      "According to a recent SIPRI report, more than half of Europe\u2019s arms imports from 2020 to 2024 came from the U.S.",
      "Changing this paradigm will take years of sustained investment, Scarazzato said, and common vision across the bloc. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive overhaul of the whole command and control structure.\"",
      "A fragmented defense industry in Europe reduces the interoperability of equipment, experts say, and makes it harder to build economies of scale.",
      "For example, there are at least 12 types of tanks produced across the 27-nation EU, compared to just one used by the U.S. military, according to the European Defense Agency.",
      "But there have been some recent positive developments in the private sector, the International Institute for Strategic Studies noted in its 2025 Military Balance report. Leonardo and Rheinmetall started a joint venture last year for combat vehicles.",
      "Europe\u2019s capitals have historically looked to spend on their own local industries \u2014 not neighboring ones \u2014 to ensure jobs and feed national pride ingrained in manufacturing military hardware, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at IISS.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental economic heft is there. Partly it\u2019s a question of political will, partly the question of national pride and national identities,\" Barrie said. \"While politicians can kind of advocate for consolidation, it has to be driven by individuals within industry, and it will be the industrialists who will see a logic in this.\u201d",
      "The urge for European governments to favor local manufacturers \u2014 instead of shopping among other European companies for better value \u2014 was evident this month when Spain announced that it will raise defense spending by an additional 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) this year.",
      "The government said 87% of that money would go to Spanish companies in the hopes of generating nearly 100,000 direct and indirect jobs and boosting Spain\u2019s GDP by 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points.",
      "\u201cEvery time there is a political interest in consolidation, that\u2019s what you bump into,\u201d Barrie said.",
      "The European Commission is offering 150 billion euros ($170 billion) for member states and Ukraine to buy air defense systems, drones and strategic enablers like air transport, as well as to boost cybersecurity.",
      "It\u2019s part of a package of measures that include easing budgetary rules for defense spending and reshuffling EU funds to reflect security priorities.",
      "Under the proposals, member states will be invited to buy at least 40% of defense equipment \u201cby working together\u201d and trade at least 35% of defense goods between EU countries, as opposed to outside ones, by 2030.",
      "Airbus' Dumont said his message for Europe's leaders was clear.",
      "\u201cEurope has to fund its European industry to prepare the defense of tomorrow, for the day after tomorrow and for the years to come. And that\u2019s what we see happening now.\u201d",

      "\u201cMs. Kardashian is reserving her testimony for the court and jury and does not wish to elaborate further at this time,\u201d they said. \u201cShe has great respect and admiration for the French justice system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities. She wishes the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion, in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",
      "In interviews and on her family\u2019s reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified as robbers pointed a gun at her.",

    "story": [
      "A violin made in 1941 inside the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau was found to contain a hidden note from its maker, Polish Jewish prisoner Franciszek Kempa",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- During World War II, within the walls of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, a Jewish prisoner secretly penned a short note and hid it inside a violin he had crafted under harrowing circumstances \u2014 a message to the future that would remain undiscovered for more than 80 years.",
      "\u201cTrial instrument, made under difficult conditions with no tools and materials,\u201d the worn note read. \u201cDachau. Anno 1941, Franciszek Kempa.\u201d",
      "The origins of the violin, built in 1941 by Franciszek \u201cFranz\u201d Kempa while imprisoned by the Nazis at Dachau in southern Germany, remained unnoticed for decades. It wasn\u2019t until art dealers in Hungary sent the instrument out for repairs \u2014 after having stored it for years among a set of purchased furniture \u2014 that its history came to light.",
      "Although the instrument's craftsmanship pointed clearly to a skilled maker, the professional repairing it was puzzled by the poor quality of the wood and the crude tools used to create it, which didn\u2019t match the evident skill involved.",
      "\u201cIf you look at its proportions and structure, you can see that it\u2019s a master violin, made by a man who was proficient in his craft,\u201d said Szandra Katona, one of the Hungarian art dealers who discovered the origins of the violin. \u201cBut the choice of wood was completely incomprehensible.\u201d",
      "Motivated by the contradiction, the professional disassembled the violin, revealing Kempa\u2019s hidden note \u2014 an apparent explanation, even an apology, from a master violin maker forced by the brutal limitations of his captivity to build an instrument that fell short of his own standards.",
      "Dachau, located near Munich, was the first concentration camp established by the Nazis in March 1933. It initially housed political prisoners but later became a model for other camps, imprisoning Jews, Roma, clergy, homosexuals, and others targeted by the Nazi regime.",
      "Over time, it became a site of forced labor, medical experiments, and brutal punishment, and remained in operation until it was liberated by American forces on April 29, 1945. At least 40,000 people are believed to have died there due to starvation, disease, execution, or mistreatment.",
      "There is ample evidence that musical instruments were present in concentration camps across Central and Eastern Europe during World War II. For propaganda purposes, the Nazis often permitted or even encouraged the formation of musical groups to give a false impression to the outside world about life in the camps.",
      "However, all known instruments that survived Dachau are believed to have been brought in by prisoners. Kempa\u2019s \u201cviolin of hope,\u201d as it has come to be called, is the only known instrument actually built inside the camp.",
      "It is unknown how the violin left Dachau and ultimately made its way to Hungary. But Kempa, according to documents provided to the Hungarian art dealers by the museum at the Dachau memorial site, survived the war and returned to his native Poland to continue making instruments before dying in 1953.",
      "The documents also suggest that Kempa was known to the Nazis as an instrument maker \u2014 something Tam\u00e1s T\u00e1losi, one of the art dealers, believes may have spared him the fate of millions of others that perished in the camps.",
      "\u201cWe named it the \u2018violin of hope\u2019 because if someone ends up in a difficult situation, having a task or a challenge helps them get through a lot of things,\u201d T\u00e1losi said. \u201cYou focus not on the problem, but on the task itself, and I think this helped the maker of this instrument to survive the concentration camp.\u201d",

      "Israel\u2019s military campaign decimating the Gaza Strip has made pregnancy and childbirth more dangerous for Palestinian women and their babies",
      "KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza City -- Nearly seven months pregnant, Yasmine Siam couldn\u2019t sleep, living in a crowded tent camp in Gaza and shaken often by Israeli bombardment. She couldn\u2019t find proper food and hadn\u2019t eaten meat for more than a month. Weak and losing weight, she saw doctors every day. There was little they could do.",
      "One night this month, pain shot through her. She worried labor was starting but was too terrified of gunfire to leave her tent. Siam waited till daybreak to walk to the nearest mobile clinic. The medics told her to go to Nasser Hospital, miles away.",
      "She had to take a donkey cart, jolted by every bump in the bombed-out roads. Exhausted, the 24-year-old found a wall to lean on for the hourslong wait for a doctor.",
      "An ultrasound showed her baby was fine. Siam had a urinary tract infection and was underweight: 57 kilos (125 pounds), down 6 kilos (13 pounds) from weeks earlier. The doctor prescribed medicine and told her what every other doctor did: Eat better.",
      "\u201cWhere do I get the food?\u201d Siam said, out of breath as she spoke to The Associated Press on April 9 after returning to her tent outside the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "\u201cI am not worried about me. I am worried about my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be terrible if I lose him.\u201d",
      "Siam\u2019s troubled pregnancy has become the norm in Gaza. Israel\u2019s 18-month-old military campaign decimating the territory has made pregnancy and childbirth more dangerous, even fatal, for Palestinian women and their babies.",
      "It has become worse since March 2, when Israel cut off all food, medicine and supplies for Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people.",
      "Meat, fresh fruits and vegetables are practically nonexistent. Clean water is difficult to find. Pregnant women are among the hundreds of thousands who trudge for miles to find new shelters after repeated Israeli evacuation orders. Many live in tents or overcrowded schools amid sewage and garbage.",
      "Up to 20% of Gaza\u2019s estimated 55,000 pregnant women are malnourished, and half face high-risk pregnancies, according to the United Nations Population Fund, or UNFPA. In February and March, at least 20% of newborns were born prematurely or suffering from complications or malnutrition.",
      "With the population displaced and under bombardment, comprehensive miscarriage and stillbirth figures are impossible to obtain. Records at Khan Younis\u2019 Nasser Hospital show miscarriages in January and February were double the same period in 2023.",
      "Dr. Yasmine Shnina, a Doctors Without Borders supervisor of midwives at Nasser Hospital, documented 40 miscarriages a week in recent weeks. She has recorded five women a month dying in childbirth, compared with around two a year before the war.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need to wait for future impact. The risks are emerging now,\u201d she said.",
      "For Siam and her family, her pregnancy \u2014 after a whirlwind, wartime marriage \u2014 was a rare joy.",
      "Driven from Gaza City, they had moved three times before settling in the tent city sprawling across the barren coastal region of Muwasi.",
      "Late last summer, they shared a meal with neighbors. A young man from the tent across the way was smitten.",
      "The next day, Hossam Siam asked for Yasmine\u2019s hand in marriage.",
      "She refused initially. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect marriage in war,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to meet someone.\u201d",
      "Hossam didn\u2019t give up. He took her for a walk by the sea. They told each other about their lives. \u201cI accepted,\u201d she said.",
      "On Sept. 15, the groom\u2019s family decorated their tent. Her best friends from Gaza City, dispersed around the territory, watched the wedding online",
      "Within a month, Yasmine Siam was pregnant.",
      "Her family cherished the coming baby. Her mother had grandsons from her two sons but longed for a child from her daughters. Siam\u2019s older sister had been trying for 15 years to conceive. Her mother and sister \u2014 now back in Gaza City \u2014 sent baby essentials.",
      "From the start, Siam struggled to get proper nutrition, relying on canned food.",
      "After a ceasefire began in January, she and Hossam moved to Rafah. On Feb, 28, she had a rare treat: a chicken, shared with her in-laws. It was her last time eating meat.",
      "A week later, Hossam walked for miles searching for chicken. He returned empty-handed.",
      "Israel has leveled much of Gaza with its air and ground campaign, vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. It has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",
      "In the Oct. 7 attack, militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. They still hold 59 hostages after most were released in ceasefire deals.",
      "In Gaza's ruins, being pregnant is a formidable struggle.",
      "It\u2019s not just about quantity of food, said Rosalie Bollen, of UNICEF, \u201cit\u2019s also about nutritional diversity, the fact that they have been living in very dire, unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the ground, sleeping in the cold and just being stuck in this permanent state of very toxic stress.\u201d",
      "Nine of the 14 hospitals providing maternal health services before the war still function, though only partially, according to UNFPA.",
      "Because many medical facilities are dislocated by Israeli military operations or must prioritize critical patients, women often can\u2019t get screenings that catch problems early in pregnancy, said Katy Brown, of Doctors Without Borders-Spain.",
      "That leads to complications. A quarter of the nearly 130 births a day in February and March required surgical deliveries, UNFPA says.",
      "\u201cEven the basics are impossible,\u201d Brown said.",
      "Under the blockade, over half the medicines for maternal and newborn care have run out, including ones that control bleeding and induce labor, the Health Ministry says. Diapers are scarce. Some women reuse them, turning them inside out, leading to severe skin infections, aid workers say.",
      "Israel says the blockade aims to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages. Rights groups call it a \u201cstarvation tactic\u201d endangering the entire population and a potential war crime.",
      "At Nasser Hospital\u2019s maternity ward, Dr. Ahmad al-Farra witnessed things go from bad to worse.",
      "Israeli forces raided the hospital in early 2024, claiming it housed Hamas fighters. Incubators in a warehouse were wrecked. The maternity ward was rebuilt into Gaza\u2019s largest and best equipped for emergencies.",
      "Since Israel broke the two-month ceasefire on March 18, the hospital has been flooded with wounded.",
      "Up to 15 premature babies at a time need respirators, but the hospital has only two CPAP machines to keep preemies breathing. Some are put on adult respirators, often leading to death, al-Farra said.",
      "Twenty CPAP machines languish outside Gaza, unable to enter because of the blockade, along with 54 ultrasounds, nine incubators and midwifery kits, according to the U.N.",
      "A lack of cleaning supplies makes hygiene nearly impossible. After giving birth, women and newborns weakened by hunger frequently suffer infections causing long-term complications, or even death, said al-Farra.",
      "Yasmine Zakout was rushed to Nasser Hospital in early April after giving birth prematurely to twin girls. One girl died within days, and her sister died last week, both from sepsis.",
      "Before the war, al-Farra said he would maybe see one child a year with necrotizing pneumonia, a severe infection that kills lung tissue.",
      "\u201cIn this war, I treated 50 cases,\u201d al-Farra said. He removed parts of the lungs in nearly half those babies. At least four died.",
      "Pregnant women are regularly among the wounded.",
      "Khaled Alserr, a surgeon at Nasser Hospital, told of treating a four months pregnant woman after an April 16 strike. Shrapnel had torn through her uterus. The fetus couldn\u2019t be saved, he said, and pregnancy will be risky the rest of her life. Two of her children were among 10 children killed in the strike, he said.",
      "In her sixth month of pregnancy, Siam walked and rode a donkey cart for miles back to a tent in Muwasi after Israel ordered Rafah evacuated.",
      "With food even scarcer, she turned to charity kitchens distributing meals of plain rice or pasta.",
      "Weakened, she fell down a lot. Stress was mounting \u2014 the misery of tent life, the separation from her mother, the terror of airstrikes, the fruitless visits to clinics.",
      "\u201cI just wish a doctor would tell me, \u2018Your weight is good.\u2019 I\u2019m always malnourished,\u201d she told the AP, almost pleading.",
      "Hours after her scare on April 9, Siam was still in pain. She made her fifth visit to the mobile clinic in two days. They told her to go to her tent and rest.",
      "She started spotting. Her mother-in-law held her up as they walked to a field hospital in the dead of night.",
      "At 3 a.m., the doctors said there was nothing she could do but wait. Her mother arrived from Gaza City.",
      "Eight hours later, the fetus was stillborn. Her mother told her not to look at the baby. Her mother-in-law said he was beautiful.",
      "Her husband took their boy to a grave.",
      "Days later, she told the AP she breaks down when she sees photos of herself pregnant. She can\u2019t bear to see anyone and refuses her husband\u2019s suggestions to take walks by the sea, where they sealed their marriage.",
      "She wishes she could turn back time, even for just a week.",
      "\u201cI would take him into my heart, hide him and hold on to him.\u201d",
      "She plans to try for another baby.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The United Nations\u2019 highest court opens hearings Monday into Israel\u2019s obligation to \u201censure and facilitate\u201d urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories, bringing the ongoing conflict in Gaza back into focus in The Hague.",
      "A week of hearings has been scheduled in response to a request last year from the U.N. General Assembly, which asked the International Court of Justice to weigh in on Israel\u2019s legal responsibilities after the country blocked the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees from operating on its territory.",
      "In a resolution sponsored by Norway, the General Assembly requested an advisory opinion, a non-binding but legally important decision from the court, on Israel's obligations in the occupied territories to \"ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival of the Palestinian civilian population?\u201d",
      "Hearings open as the humanitarian aid system in Gaza is nearing collapse. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other humanitarian supplies since March 2. It renewed its bombardment on March 18, breaking a ceasefire, and seized large parts of the territory, saying it aims to push Hamas to release more hostages. Despite the stepped-up Israeli pressure, ceasefire efforts remain deadlocked.",
      "The World Food Program said last week its food stocks in the Gaza Strip have run out under Israel\u2019s nearly 8-week-old blockade, ending a main source of sustenance for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the territory. Many families are struggling to feed their children.",
      "The United Nations will be the first to address the court on Monday, followed by Palestinian representatives. In total, 40 states and four international organizations are scheduled to participate. Israel is not scheduled to speak during the hearings, but could submit a written statement. Israel's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The United States, which voted against the U.N. resolution, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday.",
      "The court will likely take months to rule. But experts say the decision, though not legally binding, could profoundly impact international jurisprudence, international aid to Israel and public opinion.",
      "\u201cAdvisory opinions provide clarity,\u201d Juliette McIntyre, an expert on international law at the University of South Australia, told The Associated Press. Governments rely on them in international negotiations and the outcome could be used to pressure Israel into easing restrictions on aid.",
      "Whether any ruling will have an effect on Israel, however, is unclear. Israel has long accused the United Nations of being unfairly biased against it and has ignored a 2004 advisory ruling by the ICJ that found its West Bank separation barrier illegal.",
      "On Tuesday, South Africa, a staunch critic of Israel, will present its arguments. In hearings last year in a separate case at the court, the country accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza \u2014 a charge Israel denies. Those proceedings are still underway.",
      "Israel\u2019s ban on the agency, known as UNRWA, came into effect in January. The organization has faced increased criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies, who claim the group is deeply infiltrated by Hamas. UNRWA rejects that claim.",
      "Israel alleged that 19 out of UNRWA\u2019s approximately 13,000 staff in Gaza took part in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and set off the war in Gaza. UNRWA said it fired nine staffers after an internal U.N. investigation concluded that they could have been involved, although the evidence was not authenticated and corroborated. Israel later alleged that about 100 other Palestinians in Gaza were Hamas members, but never provided any evidence to the United Nations. Israel has also accused Hamas of using U.N. facilities for cover, building tunnels near U.N. buildings and diverting aid deliveries for its own use.",
      "The Israeli ban doesn't apply directly to Gaza. But it controls all entry to the territory, and its ban on UNRWA from operating inside Israel greatly limits the agency's ability to function. Israeli officials say they are looking for alternative ways to deliver aid to Gaza that would cut out the United Nations.",
      "UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding Israel's creation the previous year until there is a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
      "The agency has been providing aid and services \u2014 including health and education \u2014 to some 2.5 million Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "The Vatican has closed the Sistine Chapel, where cardinals will gather for the conclave to elect the next pope after the death of Pope Francis on April 21 at age 88.",
      "Francis was buried Saturday after a funeral in St. Peter's Square that gathered world leaders and hundreds of thousands of others, and a nine-day period of mourning is continuing before the conclave can start.",
      "But the church is at the same time turning its attention to the next steps.",

      "One key task: installing the chimney where ballots will be burned after votes.",
      "Those visitors who managed to enter on Sunday considered themselves lucky, since there is no telling how long the conclave will last, and how long the gem of the Vatican Museums will remain off-limits.",
      "\u201cI think we felt very lucky to be able to be the last group of visitors to come in today,\" said Sumon Khan, a tourist from the United States. \u201cYou know, our trip would not have been complete without seeing this beautiful place.\u201d",
      "According to a schedule determined by church law, the conclave can only begin after the nine-day mourning period. It is expected to start between May 5 and May 10.",
      "When it does, the cardinals will enter solemnly to participate in a secretive process said to be guided by the holy spirit that will result in the selection of the next leader of the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic church. The choice will determine whether the next pontiff will continue Francis' reforms, with his focus on the poor and marginalized and the environment, or whether they will choose a pontiff closer in style to conservative predecessors like Benedict XVI focused on doctrine.",
      "For inspiration, the cardinals will also have the great beauty of the frescoes painted by Michelangelo and other renowned Renaissance artists. The most recognizable is Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, showing God's outstretched hand imparting the divine spark of life to the first man.",
      "The chapel is named after Pope Sixtus IV, an art patron who oversaw the construction of the main papal chapel in the 15th century. But it was a later pontiff, Pope Julius II, who commissioned the works by Michelangelo, who painted the ceiling depicting scenes from Genesis from 1508 and 1512 and later returned to paint the Last Judgement on one of the walls.",
      "When the conclave opens, cardinals will chant the Litany of Saints, the solemn, mystical Gregorian chant imploring the intercession of the saints, as they file into the chapel and take an oath of secrecy. The chapel's thick double doors will close and the master of liturgy will utter the Latin words \u201cExtra omnes,\u201d meaning \u201ceveryone out.\u201d",
      "The secretive process is part of a tradition aimed at preserving the vote from external interference.",
      "The world will then wait for a sign that a successor to Francis has been chosen. Black smoke coming from the chimney in the Sistine Chapel will indicate that they haven't achieved the two-thirds majority for a new pope.",
      "But when a pope is finally chosen, white smoke will rise and bells will toll.",

      "Early Monday, the Houthis aired footage of what it described as a U.S. strike targeting the \u200b\u200bBani Al Harith District north of Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa. Blood stains could be seen among the rubble and a damaged truck. The Houths' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported that eight people were killed in the strike, something not immediately acknowledged by Health Ministry officials.",
      "Strikes also hit Yemen's Amran and Saada governorates during the night, the Houthis added. Two others were killed on Sunday, the Houthis said.",
      "Assessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn\u2019t released specific information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites. Funeral notices suggest high-ranking Houthis have been killed in the American attacks.",
      "\u201cTo preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,\u201d Central Command said Monday. \u201cWe are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we\u2019ve done or what we will do.\u201d",
      "But the military hasn't acknowledged strikes killing civilians \u2014 something activists warn likely has happened in the intense campaign.",
      "The U.S. is conducting strikes from its two aircraft carriers in the region \u2014 the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea.",
      "On April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign. Central Command on Monday offered an explanation for why it hit the port.",
      "\u201cU.S. strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities,\u201d it said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly sought to control the flow of information from the territory it holds to the outside world. It issued a notice Sunday that all those holding Starlink satellite internet receivers should \u201cquickly hand over\u201d the devices to authorities.",
      "\u201cA field campaign will be implemented in coordination with the security authorities to arrest anyone who sells, trades, uses, operates, installs or possesses these prohibited terminals,\u201d the Houthis warned.",
      "Starlink terminals have been crucial for Ukraine in fighting Russia's full-scale invasion and receivers also have been smuggled into Iran amid unrest there.",

      "A joint statement by the finance ministries of Saudi and Qatar said the decision to pay Syria\u2019s nearly $15 million debt to the World Bank was made during this month's meetings in Washington by the World Bank and IMF.",
      "Syria\u2019s Foreign Ministry thanked the two oil and gas-rich nations for paying the debt saying it opens the way for activating cooperation toward recovery and reconstruction after a 14-year conflict that killed half a million people and caused wide destruction in the country.",
      "Since the fall of Bashar Assad\u2019s government in early December, when insurgent groups led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham stormed his seat of power in Damascus, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been main backers of the country\u2019s new leadership.",

      "A main obstacle for development projects in Syria are Western sanctions that were imposed on the country more than a decade ago mainly targeting Assad\u2019s government and officials.",
      "The Trump administration has yet to formally recognize the new Syrian government led by president and HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. HTS remains a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and the sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad remain in place.",
      "However, Washington has eased some restrictions. The U.S. Treasury in January issued a general license, lasting six months, that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government, including some energy sales and incidental transactions.",
      "The European Union, meanwhile, has begun to ease some energy and transport sanctions and banking restrictions against Syria, suspending measures targeting oil, gas and electricity as well as transport, including the aviation sector.",
      "The British government said Thursday it was lifting sanctions against a dozen Syrian entities, including government departments and media outlets.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's president on Sunday visited those injured in a huge explosion that rocked one of the Islamic Republic's main ports, a facility purportedly linked to an earlier delivery of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant.",
      "The visit by President Masoud Pezeshkian came as the toll from Saturday's blast at the Shahid Rajaei port outside of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran's Hormozgan province rose to 40 dead with about 1,000 others injured.",
      "While Iran's military sought to deny the delivery of ammonium perchlorate from China, new videos emerged showing an apocalyptic scene at the still-smoldering port. A crater that appeared meters (yards) deep was surrounded by burning smoke so dangerous that authorities closed schools and businesses in the area.",
      "Containers appeared smashed or thrown as if discarded toys, while the burned carcasses of trucks and cars sat around the site.",
      "\u201cWe have to find out why it happened,\u201d Pezeshkian said during a meeting with officials aired by Iranian state television.",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader, the 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, separately offered his condolences over the blast \u2014 and left open the possibility that sabotage caused the explosion.",

      "Authorities described the fire as being under control, saying emergency workers hoped that it would be fully extinguished later Sunday. Overnight, helicopters and heavy cargo aircraft flew repeated sorties over the burning port, dumping seawater on the site. Satellite pictures taken Sunday by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press showed a huge plume of black smoke still over the site.",
      "Provincial Gov. Mohammad Ashouri gave the latest death toll, Iranian state TV reported. Pir Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran\u2019s Red Crescent society, said that only 190 of about 1,000 injured remained hospitalized on Sunday, according to a statement carried by an Iranian government website. The governor declared three days of mourning.",
      "Private security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March. It was part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times. The chemical used to make solid propellant for rockets was going to be used to replenish Iran\u2019s missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Ship-tracking data analyzed by the AP put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said.",
      "\u201cThe fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\u201d Ambrey said.",
      "In a first reaction on Sunday, Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Reza Talaeinik denied that missile fuel had been imported through the port.",
      "\u201cNo sort of imported and exporting consignment for fuel or military application was (or) is in the site of the port,\u201d he told state television by telephone. He called foreign reports on the missile fuel baseless \u2014 but offered no explanation for what material detonated with such incredible force at the site. Talaeinik promised authorities would offer more information later.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why Iran wouldn\u2019t have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel \u2014 meaning potentially that it had no place to process the chemical.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast, like in the Beirut explosion.",
      "Meanwhile on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed several emergency aircraft to Bandar Abbas to provide assistance.",

      "Roman Catholic faithful have begun visiting the tomb of Pope Francis",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Roman Catholic faithful began visiting the tomb of Pope Francis on Sunday, filing past the simple white tomb in St. Mary Major Basilica a day after he was bade farewell by the powerful of the world and a crowd of hundreds of thousands.",
      "A single white rose was placed on the tomb that said \u201cFranciscus\" \u2014 the pope's name in Latin. A light cast its warm glow over the tomb and a reproduction of the late pontiff's pectoral cross on the wall above it.",
      "People filed past, many crossings themselves or snapping photos with their phones.",
      "\u201cPope Francis for me was an inspiration, a guide,\u201d said Elias Caravalhal.",
      "Caravalhal lives in Rome but was unable to pay his respects to Francis when he was lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica after his death on Easter Monday at the age of 88. He said he visited the tomb to bid farewell to him, and \u201cto thank him for what he has done.\u201d",
      "The tomb was opened on the second of nine days of official mourning for Francis, after which a conclave will be held to elect the next pope.",
      "No date has yet been set for the conclave, but it must start by May 10. Cardinals who traveled to Rome for Francis' funeral will be meeting regularly this week ahead of the conclave as they start to chart a way forward for the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic Church.",
      "Pope Francis chose his place of burial in St. Mary Major Basilica, near an icon of the Madonna that he revered, because it reflects his \u201chumble, simple and essential\" life, the archbishop who administers the basilica said Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that he\u2019s no more with us,\u201d said Susmidah Murphy, who visited the bomb during a visit to Rome from her home in India. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that we don\u2019t get popes like this very often.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- One of the suspects in the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian said he plans to take responsibility for his role in the 2016 high-profile heist and will apologize in court as the trial begins Monday in Paris.",
      "Yunice Abbas, 71, who has publicly acknowledged his participation in the heist, is among 10 suspects facing charges including armed robbery and kidnapping.",
      "\u201cI will apologize,\u201d Abbas told The Associated Press. \u201cI mean it sincerely.\u201d",
      "Kardashian, 44, is expected to testify in person at the trial scheduled to run through May 23. In interviews and on her family\u2019s reality TV show, she has described being terrified as robbers pointed a gun at her to steal millions of dollars worth of jewelry in an apartment where she was staying for Paris Fashion Week. She said she thought she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "Abbas said he acted as a lookout at the reception area on the ground floor, ensuring the escape route was clear. He said he was unarmed and did not personally threaten Kardashian, but acknowledged he shared responsibility for the crime.",
      "He was arrested in January 2017 and he spent 21 months in prison before being released under judicial supervision. In 2021, he co-authored a French-language book titled \u201cI Sequestered Kim Kardashian.\u201d",
      "In her account to investigators, Kardashian described two men forcing their way into her bedroom and pointing a gun towards her, asking for her ring. She said she was tied up with plastic cables and tape while the intruders were looking for jewels, including her engagement ring worth millions of dollars.",
      "In a 2020 appearance on David Letterman\u2019s Netflix show, she tearfully recalled thinking: \u201cThis is the time I\u2019m going to get raped. I\u2019m like, \u2018What is happening? Are we gonna die? Just tell them I have children. I have babies, I have a husband, I have a family\u2019.\u201d",
      "She told investigators the men brought her in the bathroom before they ran off and she managed to free herself.",
      "The residency\u2019s concierge, held at gunpoint and forced to lead the robbers to her apartment, also suffered psychological impact.",
      "Investigators found Abbas' DNA on plastic ties used to tie the hands of the concierge.",
      "Asked about the trauma Kardashian suffered, Abbas said : \u201cIt\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t think about it. I recognize that because I did not brutalize her myself\u2026 I was not blaming myself regarding this aspect, and yet I\u2019m responsible for it too.\u201d",
      "According to Abbas, minutes after the raid started, his accomplices came down from Kardashian's apartment and gave him a bag of jewelry.",
      "As he was fleeing the scene on a bicycle, he saw a police car, but officers were not yet aware of the robbery. Abbas said as he rode the bicycle the bag containing the jewelry became caught in the front wheel and he fell to the ground, spilling the contents of the bag. \u201cI picked the jewels up and left,\u201d he said.",
      "The following morning, a passerby found a diamond-encrusted cross in the street and handed it to police. That was the only jewel from the robbery that was ever recovered.",
      "French justice estimated stolen items to be worth $6 million in total.",
      "Abbas said he didn\u2019t know Kardashian\u2019s identity at the time of the robbery.",
      "\u201cI was told about a famous person, a rapper\u2019s wife. That\u2019s all the information I had,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the next morning, when I heard on TV about the influencer. That\u2019s when I understood who she was.\u201d",
      "He said he will detail his role during the trial, which will be conducted with a jury, a procedure in France reserved for the most serious crimes \u2013 yet he would not denounce his accomplices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m only an outsider. I\u2019m not the one who masterminded the case. I take my share of responsibility,\u201d he said.",
      "Most of the suspects have denied involvement, except for Abbas and another man whose DNA was also found at the scene.",
      "Thierry Niemen, the journalist who co-authored Abbas' book, said Abbas approached him because he wanted to \u201ctell his own truth\u201d amid what he saw as inaccurate or sensationalized accounts.",
      "The book also revealed investigative details, including how the FBI helped French police identify Abbas\u2019 DNA despite him wearing gloves.",
      "\u201cThis is the case of all superlatives,\u201d Niemen said. \u201cThe FBI overseeing an investigation on French territory \u2014 that\u2019s already a superlative.\u201d Kardashian was then the top influencer in the world and the case was the most popular topic on the social media in 2016, Niemen stressed.",
      "Abbas\u2019 earnings from the book have been frozen pending the outcome of the trial.",

      "BATAN ISLAND, Philippines -- The U.S. military has deployed an anti-ship missile launcher for the first time on Batan Island in the Philippines, as Marines unloaded the high-precision weapon on the northern tip of the archipelago, just a sea border away from Taiwan.",
      "U.S. and Philippine forces separately unleashed a barrage of missile and artillery fire that shot down several drones acting as hostile aircraft in live-fire drills on Sunday in Zambales province facing the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The mock battle scenarios over the weekend in the annual Balikatan exercises between the U.S. and its oldest treaty ally in Asia, the Philippines, not only simulated real-life war. They were also staged near major geopolitical hotspots, which have become delicate frontlines in the regional rivalry between China and the U.S. under former President Joe Biden and now Donald Trump.",
      "About 9,000 American and 5,000 Filipino military personnel took part in the combat maneuvers. At least 260 Australian personnel also joined, with smaller observer delegations from Japan and other countries.",
      "China has fiercely opposed the combat drills as provocative. Its aircraft carrier group sailed by a few days earlier near Batanes, where the U.S. military had deployed the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System on Saturday on Batan near the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan, a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",
      "\"The introduction of NMESIS into the first island chain for sea denial, sea control is another step in our force design journey,\u201d U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm told a small group of journalists, including from The Associated Press, who were invited to witness the transport of the missile system aboard a C-130 Air Force aircraft to Batanes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not here practicing a war plan,\u201d said Cederholm. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing for the defense of the Philippines.\u201d",
      "The U.S. and the Philippines have denied the annual combat maneuvers \u2014 which both said would focus on a \u201cfull-scale battle scenario\u201d this year \u2014 were aimed at China or any adversary. The lines between what\u2019s mock and real, however, have been at times murky.",
      "Asked if U.S. forces would pull out the anti-ship missile system from Batanes after the combat drills, Cederholm did not reply clearly.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t broadcast when we\u2019re going in, when we\u2019re coming out and how long things are going to stay,\u201d Cederholm said. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say is we\u2019re here at the invitation and with the support of the Philippine government.\u201d",
      "\"But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s here,\u201d he said.",
      "Additionally, China had repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to the U.S. Army deployment last year of a mid-range missile system in the Philippines for joint exercises.",
      "The U.S. Army launcher with at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles was repositioned in January from an international airport in northern Laoag city to a northwestern coastal area facing the Scarborough Shoal, where China\u2019s forces have used water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard and fishery ships and fired flares near Manila\u2019s patrol planes, a Philippine official then told The AP.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to a lack of authority to discuss the delicate issue publicly.",
      "Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range.",
      "During the combat exercises from April 21 to May 9, American and Filipino forces will also practice jointly defending Philippine islands by repelling hostile forces attempting to assault from the sea in the western Philippine province of Palawan, which faces the South China Sea, and in northern Cagayan province near Batanes.",
      "Philippine Brig. Gen. Michael Logico said the combat exercises were crucial to strengthening deterrence against aggression in the Bashi Channel.",
      "\"A peaceful region can only be maintained through a proper balance of strength between opposing forces until such time that \u2026 both countries decide that it\u2019s not going to be worth it to fight over this area,\u201d Logico said.",
      "Early this month, the Chinese military staged largescale drills in the waters around Taiwan and renewed a warning to the self-ruled democracy not to seek independence. Chinese navy, air, ground and rocket forces staged the drills.",
      "The Philippines used to host two of the largest U.S. Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland. The bases were shut down in the early 1990s after the Philippine Senate rejected an extension, but American forces returned for large-scale combat exercises with Filipino troops under a 1999 agreement.",
      "Cederholm cited the tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel, along with Filipino scouts, buried in the vast American cemetery in Manila as proof of Washington\u2019s commitment to help defend the Philippines beyond the U.S. bases era in the Philippines.",
      "\"We take our treaty obligations very seriously,\u201d Cederholm said.",

      "TORONTO -- Donald Trump might as well be on the ballot when Canadians vote for a new government.",
      "The U.S. president's trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st state have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in nationalism that has helped the Liberal Party flip the narrative heading into Monday's parliamentary election, at least in opinion polls.",
      "\u201cTrump is the campaign,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cThe ballot question is who is the person we are going to choose to face Trump. Everything has changed.\u201d",
      "Foreign policy hasn't affected a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States dominated the political discourse.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney, the Liberal leader who was sworn in on March 14 following Justin Trudeau\u2019s resignation, led in the polls heading into Monday, marking a dramatic turnaround for a party that seemed destined for a crushing defeat until Trump started launching broadsides at Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty.",
      "\"We are in a crisis. President Trump is threatening Canada, he\u2019s threatening our companies, he\u2019s threatening our workers, he\u2019s threatening the savings our our retirees,\u201d Carney said Tuesday. \u201cThis threat is not only an economic threat, it is an existential threat.\u201d",
      "Until a few months ago, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre was seen as a shoo-in to become the next prime minister by shepherding his opposition faction back into power for the first time in a decade.",
      "Charest, a moderate who led Canada's French-speaking province from 2003-2012, said if Trump wants to help his ideological allies abroad, he needs to tone down the bluster.",
      "\"At what point are the Trump folks going to think this thing through and measure what are the consequences?\u201d Charest said.",
      "\u201cIn the White House, they should sit down and think about the effect Trump has in the world,\" he added.",
      "Carney has accused Trump of severing the close relationship that Canada and the U.S. long enjoyed.",
      "Poilievre, meanwhile, would be \u201cvery much in sync\u201d with the \u201cnew direction in America,\u201d said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a Conservative ally.",
      "As such, Poilievre has offered a more muted response to Trump's rhetoric and economic maneuvering, imploring Canadians to deny the Liberals a fourth-straight term after what he described as \u201ca lost Liberal decade.\u201d",
      "Trump has threatened to slap steep tariffs on Canadian goods, and both Carney and Poilievre said that, if elected, they would accelerate renegotiations of the countries' free trade deal in an effort to end the uncertainty hurting both of their economies.",
      "Carney plans to diversify Canada's exports and is reviewing the remaining purchase order of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options \u201cgiven the changing environment.\u201d Carney visited Paris and London, not Washington, for his first trips as prime minister.",
      "But almost 80% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "\u201cLet's be honest, if Canada does a remarkable job \u2014 a remarkable job \u2014 of diversifying trade, what is that going to look like?\" said former Foreign Minister John Baird, noting that even shifting 3-5% over five years would be quite an achievement.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s keep our eye on the main ball. They are 78% of our customers so we need to tackle that challenge,\" said Baird, a Conservative who works as a senior advisor at a law firm.",

In the latest Nanos poll, which was conducted during a three-day period that ended April 25, the Liberals led by three percentage points nationally and five points in Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, which has 122 of the 343 seats in Parliament.

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A peace proposal by the Trump administration that includes recognizing Russian authority over Crimea shocked Ukrainian officials, who say they will not accept any formal surrender of the peninsula, even though they expect to concede the territory to the Kremlin, at least temporarily.",
      "Giving up the land that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 is also politically and legally impossible, according to experts. It would require a change to the Ukrainian constitution and a nationwide vote, and it could be considered treason. Lawmakers and the public are firmly opposed to the idea.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezkho, a lawmaker with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s party. \u201cWe will never recognize Crimea as part of Russia.\u201d",
      "Unlike a territorial concession, a formal surrender would permanently relinquish Crimea and abandon the hope that Ukraine could regain it in the future.",
      "The Ukrainian public largely understands that land must be ceded as part of any armistice because there is no way to retake it militarily. Polls indicate a rising percentage of the population accepts such a trade-off.",
      "But much of the public messaging about land concessions has suggested that they are not necessarily permanent, as when Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko told the BBC recently that Ukraine may need to temporarily give up land as part of a peace deal.",
      "Saying otherwise would effectively admit defeat \u2014 a deeply unpopular move, especially for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation who hope to be liberated and reunited with their families one day. It also would call into question the sacrifices made by tens of thousands of Ukrainian service members who have been killed or wounded.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump underscored the Crimea proposal in an interview published Friday in Time magazine: \u201cCrimea will stay with Russia. Zelenskyy understands that, and everybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time.\u201d",
      "His comments offered the latest example of the U.S. leader pressuring Ukraine to make concessions to end the war while it remains under siege. Trump has also accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war by resisting negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Crimea, a strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, was seized by Russia years before the full-scale invasion that began in 2022. The Russian takeover followed large protests that ousted former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union.",
      "In the lead-up to peace talks, Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press for months that they expect Crimea and other Ukrainian territory controlled by Russia to be among Kyiv\u2019s concessions in the event of any deal. But Zelenskyy has said on multiple occasions that formally surrendering the land has always been a red line.",
      "Elements of Trump\u2019s peace proposal would see the U.S. formally recognizing Crimea as Russian and de facto accepting Moscow\u2019s rule over occupied Ukrainian territories, according to a senior European official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.",
      "Whether the U.S. formally recognizes Crimea as Russian is out of Zelenskyy\u2019s hands. But many obstacles prevent the Ukrainian president from doing so, even under immense pressure. He cannot unilaterally sign any such proposal, and he could be reprimanded by future governments for even attempting it, experts said.",
      "Ukraine began to accept that it would not regain its lost territories after the failure of the country's 2023 summer counteroffensive. From then on, the Ukrainian military concentrated on defending the territory it still held.",
      "In return for territorial concessions, Ukraine wants robust security guarantees that ideally would include NATO membership or concrete plans to arm and train its forces against any future Russian invasion with the pledged support of allies. One scenario envisions European boots on the ground, which Russia rejects.",
      "Zelenskyy has said negotiations over occupied Ukrainian territory will be drawn out and will not likely occur until a ceasefire is in place. In late March, he told reporters after a call with Trump that the U.S. president \u201cclearly understands that legally we will not recognize any territories.\u201d",
      "He said giving up territory would be \u201cthe most difficult question\u201d and \u201ca big challenge for us.\u201d",
      "Formal recognition of Crimea would also amount to political suicide for Zelenskyy. It could expose him to legal action in the future, said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and a former economics minister.",
      "Signing a potentially unconstitutional document could be interpreted as high treason, Mylovanov said.",
      "The Ukrainian government cannot act either. It has no constitutional means to accept a violation of its territorial integrity, and altering the territorial makeup of the country requires a nationwide referendum.",
      "If Ukrainian lawmakers were even to entertain the idea of surrendering Crimea, it would trigger a long, drawn-out legal debate.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why Russia is pushing it, because they know it\u2019s impossible to achieve,\u201d Mylovanov said.",
      "\u201cAnything related to constitutional change gives so much policy and public communication space to Russia,\" he added. \"This is all they want.\u201d",
      "Soldiers on the front line say they will never stop fighting, no matter what the political leadership decides.",
      "\u201cWe lost our best guys in this war,\u201d said Oleksandr, a soldier in the Donetsk region, who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used in line with military protocols. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop until all Ukrainian lands are free.\u201d",

      "In the U.S., newborns are screened for treatable genetic conditions. In Senegal, newborn screening is not routine. Infants who appear healthy at birth might go undiagnosed and experience irreversible decline. Glutaric acidemia type I, for example, can cause brain damage, seizures, coma and early death.",
      "San\u00e9 is waiting for genetic testing results for Aissata\u2019s one-year-old sister Aminata. Patients can live long, healthy lives if they start treatment before the onset of symptoms. That includes following a strict diet, avoiding protein-rich foods like nuts, fish and meat and taking the supplement L-carnitine. Though consultation with Rodriguez was free, lifelong treatment is not. If Aminata shares her sister\u2019s disease, San\u00e9 will need government assistance to buy medication.",
      "Dr. Moustapha Ndiaye, head of the neurology department at Fann, hopes young physicians will graduate prepared to assist rare disease patients not just in Senegal but in other African countries.",
      "\u201cStudents travel from across Africa to study here,\u201d Ndiaye said.",
      "At the start of her career, Dr. Henriette Senghor saw patients who were hospitalized for months. Some died, and no one knew why.",
      "\u201cThere was this problem\u2014there was this void,\u201d said Senghor, who\u2019s now training with Rodriguez.",
      "In 2021, Rodriguez established a partnership between the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar and the Center for National Center for Genomic Analysis in Barcelona. Rodriguez collects patients\u2019 blood samples and delivers them to Barcelona, where scientists analyze the extracted DNA, storing the answers it holds in a large database. Almost 1,300 participants\u2014patients and families\u2014have enrolled in his study of rare disease in West Africa.",
      "In the Gambia, Fatou Samba\u2019s sons Adama, 8, and Gibriel, 4, like to play soccer and feed the sheep in their backyard. On a recent afternoon, they took turns playing with a toy airplane and a globe. Adama, who hopes to be a pilot, pointed to where he wanted to go: the U.S. Outside, he started to climb a pile of bicycles propped up against the wall, and Gibriel followed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re climbing Mount Everest,\u201d Adama said.",
      "Standing on a bicycle wheel, Adama hesitated. Samba reached for him, setting him down on solid ground. There is a tiny scar on his forehead where broken skin has been stitched back together. Last year, Samba couldn\u2019t explain his frequent falling, so she sought answers in Dakar. Rodriguez confirmed Adama had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gibriel's genetic test results are pending. Children often lose the ability to run or climb stairs first, and later can\u2019t walk or raise their arms. In adulthood, they develop heart and breathing problems.",
      "Both boys are taking corticosteroids, which can slow disease progression for patients diagnosed early.",
      "\u201cWithout the medication, it would have been terrible. Once we started, after a few weeks we saw improvement,\u201d Samba said. \u201cDoctors are destined to investigate (the disease) and find a cure \u2026 I pray doctors will find a cure.\u201d",
      "Back at Fann Hospital, Rodriguez and Senghor consult with Woly Diene, 25, and her mother and brother. When Diene was 15, she started falling at school. Soon, she felt pain throughout her body. She couldn\u2019t move. She lost her hearing, the strength in her hands and control of the muscles in her face.",
      "Diene, who comes from a rural village in Senegal, has riboflavin transporter deficiency. High doses of vitamin B2\u2014a supplement available on Amazon\u2014can slow, stop and even reverse damage from this condition that is fatal without treatment.",
      "Diene took her first dose when she was diagnosed in August 2023. She still has some difficulty hearing, but Diene is walking again. She has regained the strength in her face and hands. Diene\u2019s brother Thierno said vitamin B2 is expensive, but he knows his sister needs it for the rest of her life.",
      "\u201cI am happy,\u201d Diene said, smiling. \u201cI hope to keep improving.\u201d",
      "While efforts like these help patients, they also allow doctors to collect data\u2014and that\u2019s vital for rare disease research, policy and drug development, said Lauren Moore, chief scientific officer at the National Ataxia Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe most prevalent diseases get the most attention and the most funding,\u201d she said. \u201cData \u2026 really is the first step.\u201d",
      "A $50,000 grant from the foundation allows Rodriguez and colleagues to enroll study participants in Senegal and Nigeria with inherited ataxias\u2014which can lead to muscle weakness, loss of mobility, hearing and vision difficulties and life-shortening heart problems.",
      "The USAID cuts have not affected his research, but grant awards are limited. Rodriguez, Senghor and Dr. Rokhaya Ndiaye, professor of human genetics at the University of Dakar, are making plans to ensure genetic testing continues in Senegal.",
      "Global collaboration is essential, said Ndiaye\u2014and strengthening local infrastructure is just as important.",
      "\u201cThe need is there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of hope.\u201d",

      "The briefing Monday by several senior officials of different government ministries appeared aimed at shoring up confidence with promises of support for companies and the unemployed, easier lending conditions and other policies to counter the impact of combined tariffs of up to 145% on U.S. imports from China.",
      "It followed a meeting of China's powerful Politburo last week that analysts said had focused on ways to counter keep growth on track despite slowing exports.",
      "\u201cChinese policymakers are on heightened standby mode,\u201d Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics said in a a report. She noted that the policies were similar to earlier pronouncements.",
      "Uncertainty persists over the status of exchanges, if any, between the White House and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",

      "Beijing denied that any such talks were underway, and China has retaliated against Trump's tariffs by putting 125% import duties on products from the U.S., among other measures.",
      "The officials who spoke Monday reiterated China's rejection of what leaders there call bullying.",
      "\u201cThey make up bargaining chips out of thin air, bully and go back on their words, which makes everyone see one thing more and more clearly, that is the so-called \u2018reciprocal tariffs\u2019 severely go against historical trends and economic laws, impact international trade rules and order and seriously impair the legitimate rights and interests of countries,\u201d said Zhao Chenxin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country\u2019s main economic planning agency.",
      "The trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has the potential to bring on a recession in the U.S., with repercussions across the globe. China has been struggling to recharge its own growth after the job losses and other shocks of the pandemic.",
      "Still, Chinese officials say they believe the economy has the momentum to expand at the target rate of about 5% this year, in line with growth in 2024.",
      "Yu Jiadong, a vice minister of Human Resources and Social Security, told reporters in Beijing that a full and objective analysis shows China's \u201cemployment policy toolbox is sufficient.\u201d",

      "\u201cEnterprises reducing or even stopping energy imports from the United States will have no impact on our country\u2019s energy supply,\u201d he said.",
      "China has been gradually cutting its imports of U.S. grains and other farm products, and Zhao said that stopping such purchases would not compromise the food supply. Most grain purchases were for livestock feed and the international market has adequate stocks to make up for any reduction in imports of corn, sorghum, soy and oil from American suppliers, he said.",
      "A deputy governor of the central bank, Zou Lan, said the People's Bank of China will cut interest rates and relax reserve requirements as needed to encourage lending.",
      "\u201cIncremental policies will be introduced in a timely manner to help stabilize employment, enterprises, markets, and expectations,\u201d Zou said.",
      "China can expand domestic demand through various policies including rebates for swapping old vehicles, appliances and factory equipment for new ones, Zhao said, forecasting that demand for equipment upgrades will exceed 5 trillion yuan ($34.8 billion) a year.",
      "In the longer term, China also is promoting the shift of more people to cities from the countryside, Zhao said.",
      "\u201cEvery 1 percentage point increase in the urbanization rate can stimulate trillions of investment demand,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country has very real potential and space to expand domestic demand.\u201d",

      "As Trump's trade war locks the world\u2019s two largest economies on a collision course, America's unnerved allies and partners are cozying up with China to hedge their bets. It comes as Trump's trade push upends a decade of American foreign policy \u2014 including his own from his first term \u2014 toward rallying the rest of the world to join the United States against China. And it threatens to hand Beijing more leverage in any eventual dialogue with the U.S. administration.",
      "With Trump saying that countries are \u201ckissing my ass\u201d to negotiate trade deals on his terms or risk stiff import taxes, Beijing is reaching out to countries far and near.

      "Horror movies are often one-week wonders at the box office, but Ryan Coogler\u2019s\u201cSinners\u201d is defying the odds and proving to be true event cinema.",
      "In its second weekend in theaters, \u201cSinners\u201d earned $45 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. That\u2019s down a miniscule 6% from its Easter holiday launch, the smallest drop in any genre since \u201cAvatar\u201d in 2009. Worldwide, \u201cSinners\u201d has now made $161.6 million.",
      "For the industry, the showing proves the film's reach has broadened beyond horror fans to mainstream audiences wanting to see what the hype is about. Last weekend, men made up 56% of the audience. This weekend, the gender divide narrowed to 50/50. Premium large format showings, like the 70mm IMAX screens, are also a big draw. IMAX screens worldwide accounted for some 21% of the second weekend globally, a nearly 9% increase from last weekend.",
      "The original ensemble movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, rode into theaters on a wave of great reviews. And, to be fair, \u201cSinners\u201d isn\u2019t simply a horror film: It blends elements of drama, action and musical into its southern gothic milieu.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the lowest second weekend holds for an overperforming wide release ever,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute phenomenon.\"",
      "Hollywood expects significant drop off in a movie's second week of release. Even a 50% dip is considered a solid number, baked into the movie math. When it's anything less than that, it's notable.",
      "\u201cYou can buy a great opening weekend with marketing, but if a movie doesn\u2019t have the goods, it\u2019ll drop off,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere's no greater barometer of success than a second weekend hold like this.\"",
      "The film was produced by Coogler\u2019s Proximity Media and Warner Bros., which handled the theatrical release. After some disappointments earlier in the year, it's the second major win for the studio after \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d helped energize the box office earlier this month.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d easily topped the biggest new competition this week: \u201cThe Accountant 2,\u201d a sequel starring Ben Affleck and released by Amazon MGM Studios, which opened in third place with an estimated $24.5 million in its first weekend. Gavin O'Connor directed the film, which played in 3,610 theaters in North America. Audiences gave it a promising A- CinemaScore.",
      "The film that beat \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d for second place was a 20-year-old Star Wars movie: \u201cRevenge of the Sith.\u201d The anniversary re-release took in an estimated $25.2 million over the weekend, with many sellouts reported, more than doubling last year\u2019s release of \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d Internationally, it earned $17 million from 34 territories, giving it a $42.2 million global weekend. It's one of the top grossing re-releases ever.",

      "The scary video game adaptation \u201cUntil Dawn\u201d also opened this weekend to an estimated $8 million. Sony Pictures released the film, starring Ella Rubin and Michael Cimino, which has earned $18.1 million globally.",
      "The \u201cMinecraft\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d wins have meant a huge boost for the April box office, which is up 102% from April 2024.

      "The U.S. coal industry has been in a steep decline for decades, and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed several changes that would affect it",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- President Donald Trump's administration has proposed several changes that would affect the struggling U.S. coal industry.",
      "Trump issued executive orders this month to allow mining on federal land. He has used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet the rising demand amid the growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars.",
      "The Republican president also granted nearly 70 older coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals.",
      "Trump's government efficiency team, run by Elon Musk, made plans earlier this year to terminate the leases of 34 U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration offices in 19 states.",
      "The coal industry once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production. But it has been in steep decline for decades as operators went out of business and utilities installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "U.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons (907,000 metric tons) in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons (524 million metric tons) by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Coal employment nationally peaked in the 1920s when there were about 900,000 miners. It was at about 350,000 in 1950 and has declined steadily since 1980. After the coronavirus pandemic, employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation\u2019s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112). Despite having just 15 mines, Wyoming was the highest-producing coal state due to mechanization and more accessible coal.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.",
      "MSHA is responsible for enforcing U.S. mine safety laws. It is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year. The cuts proposed by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and that could mean less thorough inspections, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for that agency.",
      "According to the DOGE website, ending the MSHA leases is projected to save $18 million. It is unclear whether inspectors\u2019 positions and other jobs from those offices would be moved to other facilities.",
      "Seven of the MSHA offices set for closing are in Kentucky and four are in Pennsylvania. West Virginia is among the states with two targeted offices. Also under consideration for closure are the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, shrinking the national footprint of an agency created during the Carter administration to restore land damaged by strip mining, and reclaim abandoned and damaged mine lands.",
      "A recent review of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by MSHA staff in the facilities on the chopping block.",
      "Industry advocates have long contended that there are other uses for coal, some of which use cleaner technology.",
      "Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Core Natural Resources is working to develop a process using West Virginia coal to create a synthetic material that can be used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, reducing U.S. dependence on countries such as China, according to Matthew Mackowiak, the company\u2019s director of government affairs.",

      "President Donald Trump's executive orders aimed at boosting coal are getting a warm embrace in West Virginia",
      "FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. -- The winner of this year's West Virginia Coal Festival teen beauty pageant walks among the ruins of a community abandoned 70 years ago and imagines the rusted remains of coal tipples and processing plants coming back to life.",
      "Ava Johnson knows West Virginia coal will not ever be what it once was. But as she makes her way along overgrown railroad tracks near the abandoned Kay Moor mine in the New River Gorge National Park looking for spikes for her collection, the 16-year-old history buff says she has heard people talking with hope about the future of an industry that has brought good-paying jobs to her state for the better part of two centuries.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t appreciate being a true West Virginian unless you realize that people risk their lives every single day to make ours better,\u201d she said.",
      "Much of that renewed sense of hope is based on the actions of President Donald Trump, who earlier this month issued new executive orders aimed at reviving an energy source that has long been flagged by scientists as the world's most polluting fossil fuel, one that directly contributes to the warming of the planet.",
      "Trump, who has pledged since his first run for the presidency in 2016 to \u201csave coal,\u201d issued orders to allow mining on federal land and to loosen some emissions standards meant to curb coal\u2019s environmental impact.",
      "\u201cAll those plants that have been closed are going to be opened, if they're modern enough,\u201d Trump said at the signing ceremony. \u201c(or) they\u2019ll be ripped down and brand-new ones will be built.\u201d",
      "The news was met with enthusiasm in West Virginia, where residents like Johnson say the coal industry is misunderstood and that they are tired of feeling unheard by their fellow Americans. But others do not think Trump will be able to fulfill promises he has made to some of his most loyal constituents.",
      "Trump and his allies are \u201cspinning a false narrative,\" said Tyson Slocum, who teaches energy and climate policy at the University of Maryland Honors College and is the energy program director for the nonprofit Public Citizen. He said market forces have shifted away from coal in ways that cannot be reversed, an opinion widely shared among economists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that Trump can do that\u2019s going to materially impact the domestic coal market,\u201d Slocum said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe energy markets, the steel markets, have fundamentally changed. And learning how to adapt and how to provide the real solutions to the concerns and fears in coal communities would be a more effective strategy than promising them a return that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d",
      "That was not the prevailing mood at a recent coal exposition in Charleston, attended by Johnson and many others who found encouragement in the Republican president's words, even if some expressed skepticism about his ability to make coal great again.",
      "\u201cFor years, our industry has felt like it\u2019s been a little bit of a whipping boy, like a political, sacrificial pawn,\u201d said Steven Tate of Viacore, a company that makes an apparatus that helps mine operators limit the amount of coal dust in a mine. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re finally starting to get the recognition that our industry deserves.\u201d",
      "Some said Trump's orders demonstrated respect for workers who gave their lives in the mines \u2014 21,000 in West Virginia, the most out of any state \u2014 and for a resource that helped build America.",
      "\u201cTrump stood his ground all the way through,\" said Jimbo Clendenin, a retired mine equipment specialist whose grandson started working in coal mining three years ago. \"He said he was for coal. And a lot of people \u2014 even a couple of them here in West Virginia \u2014 said, \u2019I just think he said that to get into office.\u2032",
      "\"Now, nobody\u2019s got any doubt. He\u2019s for coal.\u201d",
      "In recent decades, the Democratic Party\u2019s aggressive push toward clean energy led to the installation of more renewable energy and the conversion of coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "In 2016, Trump seized on the issue, promising to end what he described as Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d and to save miners\u2019 jobs. It helped in West Virginia, where a majority of voters in every county supported Trump in three presidential elections.",
      "Trump did not bring the industry back during his first term. In West Virginia, which employs the most miners of any state, the number of coal jobs fell from 11,561 at the start of his presidency to 11,418 at the end of 2020, perhaps slowing coal\u2019s steep decline but not stopping it.",
      "Slocum said Trump can defang the federal Environmental Protection Agency and deregulate mining, but he cannot save coal.",
      "\u201cIt's not the EPA, it\u2019s not Democrats that declared this war on coal,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cIt was capitalism and natural gas. And being honest about the reasons for coal\u2019s decline is the least we can do for coal-dependent communities instead of lying to them, which the Trump administration is doing. Sometimes people want to believe a lie, because it\u2019s easier than facing a hard truth.\u201d",
      "In 2009, the EPA found that planet-warming greenhouse gases put public health and welfare in danger, a determination that new EPA chief Lee Zeldin has urged Trump to reconsider. Scientists oppose Zeldin\u2019s push, and Slocum said the endangerment finding and the need to move away from coal dependence \u201cis not a theoretical debate. It is a factual, scientific one, albeit one that does not occur within the current Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Still, there is no doubt that the culture of coal is woven into the fabric of West Virginia. A miner can be a coal industry worker, but also a sports team mascot, an image emblazoned on the state flag or the name of a breakfast sandwich at Tudor\u2019s Biscuit World.",
      "In the 1950s, more than 130,000 West Virginians worked in the industry, which then had a population of around 2 million. Production peaked in 2008, a year before Johnson was born. But by then, the number of coal workers had dropped to 25,000, mostly due to mechanization.",
      "Heather Clay, who runs West Virginia Coal Festival\u2019s beauty pageant and social media, said losing coal jobs \u2014 often six-figure incomes \u2014 was especially significant in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest poverty rates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than what people outside of West Virginia understand,\u201d she said. \u2019They\u2019re always saying, \u2018Shut down coal,\u2019 \u2018Shut down coal.\u2019 So you want to shut down our economy? You want to shut down our families? You want to shut down our way of life? And it has, for a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Trump and coal industry advocates say keeping coal in the U.S. energy portfolio is essential for maintaining the power grid, servicing growing demand from innovations like artificial intelligence centers and keeping America energy-independent.",
      "But John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, said it would take a significant shift in the underlying economics for it to make financial sense for utilities to build new coal-fired plants.",
      "Natural gas is cleaner and cheaper, he said, and it\u2019s the direction most utilities are moving in. Earlier this year, First Energy announced plans to convert its two remaining coal-fired power plants to natural gas.",
      "Johnson wears the sash and crown from her pageant victory over a black dress and sneakers as she traipses through the ruins of the abandoned Kay Moor mine. She talks enthusiastically about the industry's past, but also, occasionally, about what she thinks could be a brighter future for coal in West Virginia because of what Trump has done.",
      "\u201cI think that it will positively impact not just the industry,\" she said, \u201cbut people's lives.\u201d",

      "As the White House simultaneously injects turmoil into financial markets with its trade war and dismisses fears of a downturn, retired and near-retired Americans are anxiously looking on, worried about outliving their savings or having to put off entries on their bucket lists.",
      "Keeping logged off his account has made Montgomery\u2019s days less worrisome. He and his wife adjusted their portfolio after Election Day, including moving more money into bonds. But he\u2019s not sure what more he can do if the entire world economy can be affected by Washington\u2019s decisions.",
      "\u201cI hope like hell I don\u2019t lose all my retirement savings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut where else could you put the money that these people could not disorder? They can\u2019t get into your mattress but that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "Many experts warned U.S. stocks were overpriced and due for a correction even before President Donald Trump reclaimed the Oval Office. But a historic blanket of tariffs have injected new uncertainty into the market.",
      "Though stocks rallied this week, the S&P 500 is down 10% from an all-time high reached in February. Losses in the Nasdaq and among small-cap stocks are steeper. Even bonds and the U.S. dollar have been volatile. Many economists are warning of a possible recession.",
      "It has 71-year-old Jeanne Oats Estridge feeling so \u201cparanoid\u201d she called her financial planner with an idea.",
      "\u201cHow about we put it all in cash?\u201d Oats Estridge asked.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t advise it,\u201d she heard back.",
      "Oats Estridge, who lives in Dayton, Ohio, retired from a job in software engineering and now writes books, including her latest, on four octogenarian women kidnapped by sex-trafficking aliens. Her account is down more than $40,000 and she gets angry thinking about how some in Washington have reacted to the market volatility, including Trump\u2019s recent market assessment that it was \u201ca great time to buy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere am I supposed to come up with the money to buy? My underwear drawer?\u201d Oats Estridge asks.",
      "Earlier this month, the Cboe Volatility Index, considered a \u201cfear gauge\u201d of investor pessimism, reached its highest level in five years.

      "Trump has urged people to \u201cbe cool\u201d in assessing the impact of tariffs on their investments. Asked about his own savings earlier this month, he chuckled and replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t checked my 401(k).\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meantime, brushed off the possibility that some might need to delay retiring, saying people \u201cdon\u2019t look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what\u2019s happening.\u201d",

      "Americans\u2019 retirement savings totaled about $44 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Investment Company Institute. The composition of those savings has shifted increasingly toward stocks in the last couple decades as the 401(k) has become employers\u2019 typical offering.",

Older Americans were also more likely to say they're stressed about the stock market.",

      "South Korea\u2019s main liberal opposition party has tapped its former leader Lee Jae-myung as presidential candidate in the June 3 vote",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung, a liberal who wants greater economic parity in South Korea and warmer ties with North Korea, became the main opposition party's presidential candidate Sunday, solidifying his position as front-runner to succeed recently ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "The former Democratic Party chief had led the opposition-controlled parliament\u2019s impeachment of Yoon over the imposition of martial law in December. The country's Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon earlier this month, prompting an early presidential election on June 3 to find a new president.",
      "In a nationally televised announcement, the Democratic Party announced that Lee won its presidential nomination with nearly 90% of the votes cast during the primary that ended Sunday, defeating two competitors.",
      "\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I\u2019ll humbly uphold that ardent, serious task,\u201d Lee said in a victory speech.",
      "Lee, 60, who served as the governor of South Korea\u2019s most populous Gyeonggi province and a mayor of Seongnam city, is the clear favorite to win the election.",
      "In a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday, 38% of respondents chose Lee as their preferred choice, while all other aspirants obtained single-digit ratings. The main conservative People Power Party will nominate its candidate next weekend. Its four presidential hopefuls competing to win the party ticket won a combined 23% of support ratings in the Gallup survey.",
      "It will be Lee's third bid to run for president. He lost the 2022 election to Yoon in the narrowest margin in the country\u2019s presidential elections. In 2017, Lee ranked third in a Democratic Party primary.",
      "Lee has long established an image as an anti-establishment figure who can eliminate deep-rooted inequality and corruption in South Korea. But his critics view him as a populist who relies on stoking divisions and demonizing opponents and worry his rule would likely further polarize the country.",
      "Lee currently faces five trials for corruption and other criminal charges. If he becomes president, those trials will likely stop as he will enjoy special presidential immunity from most criminal charges.",
      "Lee's rise comes as conservatives are struggling to win back public confidence in the wake of Yoon's martial law decree that plunged the country into turmoil. The People Power Party is grappling with internal feuding between senior members defending Yoon\u2019s action and reformist members who voted for his impeachment.",
      "\u201cThis election is a venue where the people hand down their judgment on Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition after the Constitutional Court issued a judicial judgment on it,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s subsequently difficult for the People Power Party to win the election if they slide over the martial law issue and fail to apologize.\u201d",
      "When Yoon declared martial law and sent troops to the National Assembly, Lee livestreamed as he went to the assembly and urged people to gather there to protect lawmakers from possible arrests. Lee and others managed to enter an assembly hall to vote down Yoon's decree, forcing him to lift it.",
      "Lee has recently made few comments that could be portrayed as too radical and has focused on ways to revive the economy, ease economic polarization and overcome a national divide.",
      "\u201cRestoring democracy is the path to national unity. Reviving economic growth is the path to national unity. Narrowing the gaps between us is the path to national unity,\u201d Lee said during Sunday's speech.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has underscored the importance of a trilateral South Korea-U.S.-Japan security partnership. But he's also called for healing badly frayed ties with North Korea, saying peace can drive South Korea's economic growth.",
      "In a recent online talk show, Lee said that he thinks the U.S. would pursue better ties with North Korea as a way to contain China and that such a stance would provide South Korea with diplomatic room to restore ties with the North.",

Keller-Sutter also serves as Switzerland\u2019s finance minister.",

The bilateral trade volume in goods and services between Switzerland and the U.S. reached a total of $185.9 billion in 2023, the embassy says on its website.",
      "Keller-Sutter said a memorandum of understanding was to be drawn up after which negotiations can begin. A document would also lay out the most important topics, and \u201cwe have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration,\u201d she was quoted as saying.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. authorities have clearly expressed their desire to find a solution with Switzerland,\u201d Keller-Sutter told SRF. She said no timetable had been set, but the two sides agreed to move forward quickly \u201cbecause uncertainty is poison for the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the \u201cimportant role of Swiss companies and investments\" in the U.S.",
      "Hours later, Trump announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation \u2014 which was not confirmed \u2014 in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.",
      "On Thursday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, during a trip to Beijing, said the U.S. tariffs have thrust the affected countries into \u201ca sort of coalition\u201d to try to reach a deal with the United States. And on Monday, Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years \u2014 an unspecified amount of which has already been under way.",

      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes slowed in March, a sluggish start to the spring homebuying season as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective home shoppers.",
      "Existing home sales fell 5.9% last month from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The March sales decline is the largest monthly drop since November 2022, when sales fell 6.7% from the previous month.",
      "Sales fell 2.4% compared with March last year. The latest home sales fell short of the 4.12 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.",
      "The average cost of a U.S. mortgage, which climbed to its highest level in two months last week, is a significant barrier for would-be homebuyers, said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.",
      "\u201cResidential housing mobility, currently at historical lows, signals the troublesome possibility of less economic mobility for society,\u201d Yun said.",

      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "Higher mortgage rates also dampened the start of the spring homebuying season in 2024. This year, after climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained mostly elevated, climbing last week to 6.83%, its highest level in eight weeks, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",
      "Sales fell in March even as home shoppers more homes hit the market for the spring homebuying season.",
      "There were 1.33 million unsold homes at the end of last month, an 8.1% increase from February, NAR said.",
      "That translates to a 4-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 3.2-month pace at the end of March last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.",
      "\u201cI felt that more inventory would lead to more sales, but that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Yun said.",

      "BERLIN -- The German government forecast Thursday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, will stagnate this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance following months of political uncertainty.",
      "Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the government cut its 2025 outlook to zero from the modest growth of 0.3% it predicted at the end of January. For next year, it is forecasting growth of 1%, slightly lower than the 1.1% it predicted three months ago.",
      "\u201cThere is above all one reason for this, namely Donald Trump's trade policy and the effects of the trade policy on Germany,\u201d Habeck told reporters in Berlin. He noted that Germany also hasn't had a government with a parliamentary majority to set policy since early November, and the new government isn't yet in place after an election in February.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president\u2019s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.",
      "Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump\u2019s trade policies will increase prices \u201ca lot\u201d and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up \u201csomewhat,\u201d according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.",
      "While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn\u2019t mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.",
      "Three months into his second term, Trump\u2019s handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That\u2019s roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Matthew Wood, 41, said he\u2019s waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he\u2019s feeling anxious.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,\u201d said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. \u201cPersonally, it hasn\u2019t affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don\u2019t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.\u201d",
      "Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump\u2019s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he\u2019s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That\u2019s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn\u2019t previously have an opinion on tariffs.",
      "Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.",
      "\u201cActually, I think he shouldn\u2019t have suspended it,\u201d said Manis, a retired sheriff\u2019s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. \u201cBecause now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.\u201d",
      "Not quite 100 days into Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.",
      "Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He\u2019s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes \u2014 albeit partially suspending some of them \u2014 launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump\u2019s tariff pronouncements.",
      "Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.",
      "Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.",
      "Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not \u201csustainable.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance.

      "\u201cThis whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,\u201d said Nicole Jones, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge \u2014 and everybody\u2019s losing on it.\u201d",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday found the U.S. government liable to the state of North Dakota for more than $28 million in the state's lawsuit for recouping millions of dollars for policing the protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Wednesday found the state of North Dakota entitled to nearly $28 million for responding to protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 a win for the state in its multiyear effort to recoup the costs from the federal government.",
      "The state filed the lawsuit in 2019, seeking $38 million for policing the protests. The sometimes-chaotic demonstrations drew international attention for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline\u2019s Missouri River crossing upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline, fearing an oil spill polluting its water supply.",
      "A trial played out over several weeks in early 2024 in federal court in Bismarck, the state capital. People who testified included former North Dakota governors Doug Burgum, who took office in December 2016 during the protests\u2019 height, and Jack Dalrymple, whose administration responded to the protests\u2019 early months.",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers liable to the state on all claims and for more than $27.8 million in damages.",
      "The judge wrote: \u201cThe bottom line: United States had a mandatory procedure, it did not follow that procedure, and harm occurred to the state of North Dakota. The law allows reimbursement for this harm. More than that, the rule of law requires this Court to hold the United States liable to remind it of its role in the larger picture of ensuring peace, not chaos.\u201d",
      "Thousands of people camped and demonstrated against the pipeline near the crossing for months. Hundreds of arrests resulted. Sometimes-violent clashes occurred between protesters and law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers from around the state and region responded to the protests.",
      "\u201cIt was a violent, unlawful protest. And \u2018protest\u2019 is a gentle word,\u201d North Dakota Attorney Drew Wrigley said last year before trial.",
      "The protest camps were cleared in February 2017. An attorney for the state said the protests ended in a response of more than seven months involving 178 agencies, resulting in 761 arrests and requiring four days of cleanup of the camp to remove millions of pounds of trash.",
      "\u201cAlthough the unlawful protest was burgeoning before everyone's eyes and the damages and dangers were so apparent, the federal government refused to offer assistance and enforce the legal obligations on the people who were encamped,\" Wrigley said.",
      "Attorneys for the government said at trial that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials \u201cacted reasonably given limited options at their disposal\u201d during the protests, and that the state's claim is \u201cgreatly overstated.\" The government asked the judge to find a lack of legal jurisdiction for the state's claims, that the state hasn't proven its claims and is not entitled to damages.",
      "The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017. Many state government officials and industry leaders support the pipeline as crucial infrastructure in the country\u2019s No. 3 oil-producing state. The pipeline carries roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.",
      "In 2017, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer, donated $15 million to help cover the response costs. That same year, the U.S. Justice Department gave a $10 million grant to the state for reimbursing the response. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how that amount affected the damages.",
      "Then-President Donald Trump denied a 2017 request from the state for the federal government to cover the costs through a disaster declaration.",
      "The pipeline is operating while a court-ordered environmental review of the river crossing is carried out.",
      "A North Dakota jury recently found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims brought by the pipeline's builder in connection with protest activities, with damages surpassing $660 million for three Greenpeace organizations.",

      "France favors a system where the islands would be jointly managed by the two countries, but the U.K.'s decision last year to hand over control of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius has spurred some in Madagascar to push for full control of the Scattered Islands \u2014 which are known as the Eparses Islands in France.",
      "Madagascar and France \u201care determined to find a solution together,\u201d Rajoelina said.",
      "Macron said he would work with Madagascar over the agreed return of three skulls that were taken from Madagascar more than 125 years ago and displayed in a Paris museum. One of them is believed to be the skull of King Toera of the Sakalava people, who was beheaded by French troops in 1897.",

This is a guy that is in the prime of his career and he\u2019s just going through it a little bit,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI tell our players all the time, you make a career at this long enough and you\u2019re going to face some challenging moments, you\u2019re going to face some adversity along the way.\u201d",
      "Williams was among the major leagues' most dominant pitchers with the Brewers from 2019-24, with a 1.83 ERA, 68 saves in 78 chances, an average of 14.39 strikeouts per nine innings and a .156 opponents' batting average. He has dropped to 9.0 strikeouts per nine innings and a .343 opponents' batting average this season.",
      "Batters had a .097 average last year against his changeup, known as the \u201cAirbender.\u201d They are hitting .273 against it this season. Batters are hitting .462 against his fastball, up from .111.",
      "\u201cIt's just a matter of conviction in what I\u2019m doing on the mound and the pitches I\u2019m throwing and sequences we\u2019re doing,\" Williams said.",
      "Weaver learned about the closer role last year, when he was 4 for 4 in save chances in September and 4 for 7 in the postseason.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intense, but you kind of welcome it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou find out kind of who you are out there. You find out if you thrive in it, if it adds more pressure. It tests you in your mental capacity.\u201d",
      "AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil, sidelined since Feb. 28 because of a high-grade lat strain, started his throwing program Sunday.",
      "\u201cImportant step in the process,\u201d Boone said.",
      "Gil is on the 60-day injured list and is projected to return in June at the earliest.",
      "Returning from internal brace elbow surgery on April 12 last year, 30-year-old right-hander Jonathan Lo\u00e1isiga threw 11 pitches and struck out one in a perfect sixth inning on Saturday for Class A Tampa against Dunedin. It was the first rehab outing for Lo\u00e1isiga, who could rejoin the Yankees in late May or June.",
      "Veteran infielder DJ LeMahieu, sidelined since straining his left calf in his spring training debut on March 1, made a fourth rehab appearance Sunday for Double-A Somerset and is 6 for 10 with a double and a home run. He has been playing second base and will start to play third next week.",

      "Liverpool has been crowned Premier League champion after a 5-1 win against Tottenham",
      "LIVERPOOL, England -- A selfie with Mohamed Salah. An impromptu sing-along with Arne Slot. Fireworks and flares.",
      "It was party time at Anfield as Liverpool sealed the Premier League title in style.",
      "The 5-1 rout of Tottenham was almost a side issue as a record-equaling 20th English league championship was confirmed Sunday \u2014 matching the achievement of Liverpool's great rival Manchester United.",
      "\u201cEveryone was sitting on the bus saying there is no way we are going to lose the game,\u201d said Slot, standing in the middle of the field after being dowsed in champagne by his players.",
      "Fans had turned up long before kickoff, lining the streets around the stadium in anticipation of a title celebration. And despite going behind to an early goal from Dominic Solanke, Liverpool didn't let them down \u2014 racing to a 3-1 lead by halftime to effectively ensure there would be no further delay to a title victory that has looked likely for much of the season.",
      "\u201cYou see so many fans already outside in red early on and you just want to get the job done,\u201d captain Virgil van Dijk said, adding \u201cit was incredible to be part of.\u201d",
      "The smell of sulfur filled the air early in the day as red smoke canisters were let off outside the famous stadium that has been home to so many championship-winning Liverpool teams. Flags were hung from nearby houses.",
      "Inside the ground, giant banners floated across the stands, celebrating icons past and present.",
      "Slot has joined that list of club greats in only his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp.",
      "He also joins a select group of managers by winning the title in his first year in the Premier League \u2014 following Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte.",
      "He has managed it with plenty to spare, with Liverpool 15 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal with four rounds of the season to go.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big job and the manager did it in his own way together with his staff,\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cHe definitely deserves a lot of credit for that.\u201d",
      "Slot is also the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League, which is some feat considering serial trophy winners like Louis van Gaal, Guus Hiddink and Erik ten Hag have all managed in English soccer's top flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always special to win something. It\u2019s even more special if you\u2019re the first one, and even more special at a club where it\u2019s not common that you win the league every year,\u201d said Slot, who paid tribute to his predecessor by singing Klopp's name to fans after the final whistle.",
      "Klopp had led Liverpool to a full set of trophies in more than eight years in charge, including the Champions League and that long-awaited Premier League. Few could have expected Slot to have such an instant impact in his first year in a new country \u2014 halting Manchester City's dominance of English soccer at the first attempt.",
      "Slot thanked Liverpool's owners for their faith in hiring him from Dutch team Feyenoord last year.",
      "\u201cFor them to trust me to be in this position, maybe now everybody says \u2018That makes complete sense,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut the moment they signed me, maybe not everyone was as convinced as everyone is now.",
      "\u201cSo, that tells you also what a special club this is that they don\u2019t always go for the maybe the most simple or obvious choice \u2013 they make the choice that they think is best for the club.\u201d",
      "City manager Pep Guardiola was quick to congratulate Slot on a \u201cwell deserved\u201d victory.",
      "This was Liverpool\u2019s second title in five years, having ended a 30-year wait to be champion in 2020. But this time there was a crucial difference as the triumph was shared with supporters.",
      "Five years ago Liverpool had to finish off the season behind closed doors as the U.K. faced lockdown restrictions because of the COVID pandemic. Now there was a packed stadium to erupt at the final whistle and watch as the players danced and embraced on field.",
      "\u201cThis is way better, 100%,\u201d Salah said. \u201cIt feels more special with the fans. You have a different group now, a different manager. To show you are able to do it again is something special.\u201d",
      "Throughout the match a packed Anfield crowd had been in rapturous voice, singing the club\u2019s anthem \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d in the final moments.",
      "It was reprised later as Slot and his players stood facing the famed Kop stand to be serenaded by fans.",
      "Having spent 206 days at the top of the standings, Liverpool only needed one more point to be confirmed champion.",
      "For a brief moment Solanke's 12th-minute header had threatened to spoil the party, but the home team powered back with strikes from Luis Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gapko before halftime. Salah added another after the break and Destiny Udogie's own-goal rounded off the rout.",
      "In the end, the victory was so comfortable that Salah even had time to pose for a selfie in front of the crowd after scoring his 33rd goal of the season in all competitions.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored in added time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Manchester United at Bournemouth in the other Premier League game on Sunday.",
      "United was on course to lose for a 16th time in the league this season after Antoine Semenyo\u2019s first-half strike. But a late flurry of pressure paid off for United after Bournemouth went down to 10 men and Hojlund converted from close range for his ninth goal of the season.",
      "The point moved United up to 14th in the standings.",
      "Semenyo fired a low shot from inside the box to beat United goalkeeper Andre Onana in the 23rd minute.",
      "Bournemouth had chances to extend its lead with Dango Ouattara hitting the post with a free kick after the break. But when Evanilson was sent off for a lunge on Noussair Mazraoui following a VAR review in the 70th, United began to increase the pressure.",
      "The visitors still had to wait until the sixth minute of added time for Hojlund to divert Manuel Ugarte\u2019s effort past Kepa Arrizabalaga.",
      "Manchester City reached the FA Cup final for the third year in a row by beating Nottingham Forest 2-0 at Wembley Stadium to maintain a chance of ending a dismal season with a trophy.",
      "City scored early in each half of the semifinal as Rico Lewis put his team ahead in just the second minute and defender Josko Gvardiol doubled the lead in the 51st with a header from a corner.",
      "City will play Crystal Palace in the final on May 17.",

      "Shedeur Sanders\u2019 dramatic fall to Day 3 of the NFL draft baffled fans, analysts and some general managers and coaches",
      "Shedeur Sanders\u2019 dramatic fall to Day 3 of the NFL draft baffled fans, analysts and some general managers and coaches.",
      "Sanders was considered a top-five overall pick after finishing his career at Colorado but he wasn\u2019t even among the first five quarterbacks selected.",
      "He slipped all the way to the fifth round without any obvious explanation, leaving everyone to speculate about his shortcomings and question whether his Hall of Fame dad Deion Sanders somehow scared teams away.",
      "Shedeur Sanders was never involved in any off-field incidents yet his character was assailed by various media outlets who cited unidentified sources in the weeks leading up the draft.",
      "An anonymous assistant coach in an NFL Network report labeled him \u201centitled\u201d and said Sanders \u201chad the worst formal interview\u201d he\u2019d been involved in during his career. That coach also said Sanders blamed teammates and had \u201chorrible body language.\u201d",
      "The Cleveland Browns ended up taking Sanders with the 144th pick after they were thought to be considering him at No. 2 overall. The Browns even selected Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel in the third round at No. 94 but then moved up in the draft to snag Sanders one pick before the Philadelphia Eagles were on the clock.",
      "Though the Eagles have a franchise QB in Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts, Browns general manager Andrew Berry worked in Philadelphia with GM Howie Roseman and knows he\u2019s not afraid to take the best-available player on the board.",
      "That\u2019s how Hurts ended up on the Eagles in 2020 when Carson Wentz was already there. That doesn\u2019t mean Philly was targeting Sanders but Cleveland had waited long enough.",
      "\u201cWe felt like he was a good, solid prospect at the most important position,\u201d Berry said. \u201cWe felt like it got to a point where he was probably mispriced relative to the draft. Really, the acquisition cost was pretty light, and it\u2019s a guy that we think can outproduce his draft slot.",
      "\u201cI think, obviously, Shedeur has kind of grown up in the spotlight, but our expectation is for him to come in here and work and compete. Nothing\u2019s been promised. Nothing will be given.\u201d",
      "Sanders, who played for his father in college, said all the right things after he was finally selected.",
      "\u201cNothing really affected me the last couple of days, just really pushed having faith, understanding God really had me,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m blessed. Besides that, it\u2019s not really anything that changes. The love of the game is still the same. When you get on the field, it wasn\u2019t too much negativity being said. I know I\u2019ve got to clean up some things in my game for me to be at my best, but that\u2019s why I take each offseason one at a time and fix it. So I think that was just outside of football getting in the way, but therefore I have an opportunity now. Then we\u2019re about to get on grass really soon.\u201d",
      "Three team officials told the AP on Friday they had first-round grades on Sanders. Another team executive said he gave him a second-round grade. All four had starting QBs. Broncos coach Sean Payton and Patriots personnel boss Eliot Wolf both said it was \u201csurprising\u201d to see Sanders drop that far.",
      "Payton watched his pro day and said Sanders was \u201coutstanding.\u201d Titans general Mike Borgonzi praised him. So did Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, though Pittsburgh kept passing him and wound up with Will Howard in the sixth round.",
      "So what caused Sanders\u2019 unprecedented slide?",
      "The knocks against Sanders\u2019 football skills are that he takes too many sacks, isn\u2019t athletic enough and doesn\u2019t have great arm strength.",
      "Louis Riddick, an ESPN analyst who was a director of pro personnel with Philadelphia and Washington, called that \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a personal discussion. It\u2019s whether or not teams are comfortable with everything that comes along with Shedeur in terms of who he is as a person, all the people that are surrounding him in terms of his inner circle and whether or not teams deem that something they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d Riddick said on Saturday\u2019s broadcast. \u201cRight or wrong, that\u2019s the only conclusion you can come to at this point because, obviously, it\u2019s a subjective argument as to what his actual physical skills are on the football field.",
      "\u201cBut I think if you are trying to be objective about it, and remove everything else surrounding this young man and everything that comes along with him, he can play the game of football. This is a guy who\u2019s extremely accurate. He\u2019s extremely mobile. He has a lot of mental horsepower. He played the game at a high level. It\u2019s as simple as that but if you go into this whole evaluation process and you\u2019re already biased toward feeling you want to emphasize the negative and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case for me, but if you want to emphasize some of the things that really don\u2019t have to do with anything on the football field and you get caught up in all the rest of it, it can start skewing your judgment as to what this young man actually brings in terms of value.\u201d",
      "Sanders, like his \u201cPrime Time\u201d father, oozes confidence that can be misconstrued as arrogance. He probably made more money off NIL deals in college than he will in his rookie contract. His flash and style could rub some folks \u2014 maybe old-school assistant coaches \u2014 the wrong way.",

      "Rest for the best.",
      "Oklahoma City, which finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA at 68-14, closed out a four-game sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday with a 117-115 victory. The Thunder, who have won eight straight dating to the regular season, await the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Denver Nuggets series that is tied 2-2.",

I think trying to find a balance between those two is going to be important, however long it is that we have to wait until this next series.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City dominated the first two games at home and then faced a tougher challenge on the road. After winning Game 1 by 51 points and capturing Game 2 by 19, the Thunder had to overcome a 29-point deficit in Game 3 before holding off a late Memphis rally in Game 4.",

      "It was all so much to absorb \u2014 his teammates mobbing him on the ice, his good friend Nathan MacKinnon bear-hugging him on the bench, the crowd thunderously chanting his name.",

      "It was almost a surreal scene when Landeskog's second-period snap shot found the back of the net after a pass from Brock Nelson. The crowd instantly erupted and Landeskog's teammates on the ice rushed over to celebrate. The Avalanche bench was elated, too, as he passed through for glove taps \u2014 and eventually that bear hug from MacKinnon.",

      "Landeskog\u2019s injury traces back to the 2020 \u201cbubble\u201d season when he was accidentally sliced above the knee by the skate of teammate Cale Makar in a playoff game against Dallas. Landeskog eventually underwent a cartilage transplant procedure on May 10, 2023, with no timetable for a return \u2014 or even if he could return.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of more than just a playoff goal,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cI think it was a life goal. It meant a lot to all of us for him to score a goal, and then he had an assist.\u201d",
      "After the game, his teammates made Landeskog wear the oversized Avalanche hat, which is part of the celebration to recognize the team's top player in a win. To think, that particular celebration was his idea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been quite entertaining seeing guys put it on and wear it and look quite silly,\u201d said Landeskog, whose team plays Game 5 on Monday in Dallas. \u201cAnd then I got to put it on and guys always joke about how big my head is, so it was quite snug on me. But it was fun to finally put it on, no doubt.\u2019\u2019",

      "\"This morning, I woke up and it\u2019s just no excuses. I don\u2019t want to make this about me missing X-amount of days or whatever. It\u2019s a huge playoff game for us, a must-win here at home and and I think our team played that way, and played real hard and real well. I think I was no different than anybody else tonight.

      "Artificial intelligence technology that works well for the world\u2019s billions of people of color was a business imperative for Google when the company asked sociologist Ellis Monk to help make its AI products more inclusive",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- After retreating from their workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs, tech companies could now face a second reckoning over their DEI work in AI products.",
      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A lawsuit against Florida's ban on \u201clab-grown\u201d meat is still alive after a federal judge tossed four parts of the suit on Friday but kept a fifth.",
      "Northern District of Florida Chief Judge Mark Walker declined to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that argued Florida's restrictions give an unconstitutional advantage to Florida farmers over out-of-state competitors. Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last year by Upside Foods, represented by the nonprofit law firm the Institute for Justice.",
      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis was flanked by cattle farmers last May when he signed the state\u2019s cultivated meat ban into law.",
      "\u201cWe stand with agriculture, we stand with the cattle ranchers, we stand with our farmers because we understand it\u2019s important for the backbone of the state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cTake your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere.\u201d",

      "X, the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on technology law, said in an interview Friday that it's important to separate the free-speech issues from whatever one thinks about the controversial Musk.",
      "\u201cI'm almost positive that this will be struck down,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",
      "\u201cPeople want to be fooled, and it's very bad for our democracy, but it\u2019s not something I think can be solved with a deepfakes ban,\" he said.",

      "Google\u2019s first-quarter performance illustrated the continuing power of its long-dominant search engine in a sea of uncertainty. While grappling with competitive threats emerging as artificial intelligence reshapes technology, Google is also battling court decisions condemning its search engine and digital ad network as illegal monopolies.",

      "Google's long-dominant search engine is countering the new competition with a feature called AI Overviews that appear above web links in its results. It is also testing a conversational tool called AI Mode that would usher in an even more radical change to its business model.",
      "\u201cThe company delivered a sound response to those questioning the solidity of the search business amid ever-increasing AI demand,\u201d Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said.",
      "But Google is trying to keep its business intact as by the U.S. Justice Department attempts to break up the company and impose other restraints after a federal judge last year branded its search engine an illegal monopoly. To make matters worse, its digital ad network also was found to be illegally abusing its power earlier this month in another case brought by the Justice Department.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has injected more uncertainty into the mix by rattling the financial markets amid fears the tariffs will reignite inflation while dragging the economy into a recession. Although Google\u2019s digital services aren\u2019t directly impacted by the tariffs, a recession would likely curtail the spending on ads that generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.",
      "But there were few signs of a slowdown in the past quarter. Google's ad revenue during the period totaled $72.5 billion, an 11% increase from the same time a year ago.",
      "The steady growth emboldened Alphabet to stand firm on plans to invest $75 billion on AI and other technologies this year while also pursuing approval of a $32 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz.",

      "BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world\u2019s largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
      "Here are some of the key players:",
      "Great Wall Motors, with the Haval, Wey, Ora, Poer and Tank brands, is banking on overseas sales to keep growing after seeing its sales inside China fall by nearly 15% last year, even as the company\u2019s net profit jumped more than 80%. The company has factories in Russia, Thailand and Brazil, where it is challenging Toyota\u2019s popular Hilux pickup truck with its GWM Poer, a hybrid pickup of its own. Another mainstay is the Haval H6, a hybrid sports SUV.",
      "Great Wall has smoothed its transition to overseas production by buying factories of other automakers. In Thailand, it took over a factory formerly operated by General Motors Corp. In Brazil, it purchased a former Mercedes-Benz plant.",
      "\u201cIt is essential for volume to be big, otherwise the cost of production is too high,\u201d Great Wall\u2019s chairman, Wei Jianjun, said in a media huddle at the show. Wei, who also goes by the name Jack Wey, was born in Beijing but moved to nearby Hebei, home of the Great Wall. He led the company\u2019s transition from vehicle modification to automaking, becoming China\u2019s biggest maker of pickup trucks and a leading SUV maker. The company has a joint venture for EVs with BMW.",
      "State-owned Chery Automobile says it was the first Chinese automaker to export overseas. It has sold more than 15 million of its Chery, Exeed, Omoda and Jetour models overseas, mostly in the developing world and emerging markets, including Turkey and Ukraine. Chery reported selling 2.6 million vehicles overseas last year and is aiming for 3 million in 2025. It\u2019s quickly expanding overseas production, setting up factories in Russia and Spain. It is expanding rapidly in Latin America.",
      "Chery\u2019s tie-up with EV-maker Visionary Vehicles aimed to sell in North America but has not yet achieved that goal. The company has a 50-50 joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India that makes Jaguars and Land Rovers in China. It also collaborates with Huawei Technologies and e-commerce giant Alibaba.",

      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",

      "BYD barely nudged ahead of Tesla in production of battery-powered EVs in 2024, making 1,777,965 compared with Tesla\u2019s 1,773,443.",
      "Geely Auto is perhaps the most famous Chinese automaker that many people have never heard of. The privately held company was founded as a refrigerator-maker by businessman Li Shufu in 1997 in eastern China\u2019s Taizhou, which early on became a hub of private industry.",
      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus. It formed a 50-50 joint venture to make Smart city cars with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. It also works with Renault SA of France on powertrains and owns a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda.",

One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The State Bar of California has disclosed that some multiple-choice questions in a problem-plagued bar exam were developed with the aid of artificial intelligence.",
      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,\u201d Leah Wilson, the State Bar\u2019s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement.",
      "Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering admission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "Rubio says the week ahead is \"critical\" in reaching a deal.",
      "President Donald Trump said Sunday he wants a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war in \"two weeks or less,\" but later said a little more time might be acceptable.",
      "Trump's deadline comes a day after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Vatican City while they were in Rome for Pope Francis' funeral.",
      "\"I think the meeting went well, we'll see what happens over the next few days. We'll probably learn a lot,\" Trump told reporters on the tarmac at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey before returning to Washington.",
      "Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" that Russia continued to carry out missile and drone strikes in Ukraine days after he had implored Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the attacks while negotiations continued.",
      "When asked what he and Zelenskyy talked about, Trump said Zelenskyy emphasized their need for more weapons.",
      "\"He told me that he needs more weapons and we're going to see what happens -- I want to see what, with respect to Russia -- with Russia I've been surprised and disappointed when they did the bombing,\" Trump said.",
      "When asked what he wants from Putin, Trump replied, \"I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal. We have the confines of a deal I believe and I want him to sign it and be done with it and just go back to life.\"",
      "Trump also said that Ukraine reclaiming its territory in Crimea that Russia occupied in 2014 would be complicated while blaming former President Barack Obama for allowing Russia to take the region. Asked whether he thought Ukraine would give up Crimea, Trump said \"I think so.\"",
      "Earlier Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Russia and Ukraine are closer to a deal after Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy, but a deal is still not there.",
      "He said the U.S. will now need to weigh if it's time for the U.S. to step in to mediate talks.",
      "\u201cWell, I think they're closer in general than they've been any time in the last three years, but it's still not there,\u201d Rubio told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue, as I said, to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it's not going to come to fruition. So the last week has really been about figuring out how close are these sides really and are they close enough that this merits a continued investment of our time as a mediator in this regard.\u201d",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy met in Vatican City on Saturday while both were in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said the two had a \"very productive session.\" Zelenskyy described the meeting as \"good\" in a post on X and said, \"Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.\"",
      "After their meeting, Trump blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's continued bombardments of Ukrainian cities, which continued overnight into Sunday morning with more drone attacks on six Ukrainian regions. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces downed eight Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday morning.",
      "Rubio was asked why the U.S. trusts that Putin won't invade Ukraine again or another European country as he has never acknowledged Ukraine's right to exist.",
      "\u201cWell, I don't think peace deals are built on trust. I think peace deals have to be built on verification. Have to be built on facts, have to be built on action, have to be built on realities,\" Rubio said. \"So this is not an issue of, well, of trust. It's an issue of building in these sorts of things, verification, security, guarantees, things that have been discussed in the past,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. has made \"real progess, but those last couple steps of this journey were always going to be the hardest ones, and it needs to happen soon.\u201d",
      "Rubio wouldn\u2019t elaborate on a timeline of a deal but instead stressed this is a \"critical week\" for the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in, or if it's time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more important, in some cases, but we want to see it happen, there are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic, of course, as well,\" he said. \"We're close, but we're not close enough.\u201d",
      "Asked if he supported negotiations, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN's \"State of the Union that he fears Trump will cave in to Putin and \"sell out\" Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cWell, look, my great fear, Dana, is that Trump will just cave in to Putin,\" Schumer told CNN's Dana Bash. \"That's been the overall indications all along. And, of course, the bottom line is very simple, that if we cave to Putin, if Trump caves in to Putin, it's three -- it's bad in three very bad ways:\u201d abandoning Ukraine would be a \"moral tragedy, he said, and would \"tear asunder\" alliances with European allies.",
      "\"But, third, and maybe worst of all, it's a sign that the United States is weak. It sends a signal to every dictator in China, in North Korea, in Iran that, if you stand up and bully Trump, you're going to get your way,\" he said.",
      "National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that more sanctions against Russia could be coming as the U.S. tries to force it to make a deal.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital killed at least eight people overnight, the Houthi rebels said Monday, as the American military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in their monthlong campaign.",
      "The overnight statement from the U.S. military's Central Command also said its \u201cOperation Roughrider\u201d targeting the rebels had \u201ckilled hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,\u201d including those associated with its missile and drone program. It did not identify any of those officials.",
      "The U.S. insisted it would continue to carry out its airstrikes, which began March 15 under President Donald Trump as he seeks a deal with Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime.\u201d",
      "It added: \"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region.\"",
      "The U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis also are the last militant group in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.",
      "Early Monday, the Houthis aired footage of what it described as a U.S. strike targeting the \u200b\u200bBani Al Harith District north of Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa. Blood stains could be seen among the rubble and a damaged truck. The Houths' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported that eight people were killed in the strike, something not immediately acknowledged by Health Ministry officials.",
      "Strikes also hit Yemen's Amran and Saada governorates during the night, the Houthis added. Two others were killed on Sunday, the Houthis said.",
      "Assessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn\u2019t released specific information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites. Funeral notices suggest high-ranking Houthis have been killed in the American attacks.",
      "\u201cTo preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,\u201d Central Command said Monday. \u201cWe are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we\u2019ve done or what we will do.\u201d",
      "But the military hasn't acknowledged strikes killing civilians \u2014 something activists warn likely has happened in the intense campaign.",

      "On April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign. Central Command on Monday offered an explanation for why it hit the port.",
      "\u201cU.S. strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities,\u201d it said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly sought to control the flow of information from the territory it holds to the outside world. It issued a notice Sunday that all those holding Starlink satellite internet receivers should \u201cquickly hand over\u201d the devices to authorities.",
      "\u201cA field campaign will be implemented in coordination with the security authorities to arrest anyone who sells, trades, uses, operates, installs or possesses these prohibited terminals,\u201d the Houthis warned.",
      "Starlink terminals have been crucial for Ukraine in fighting Russia's full-scale invasion and receivers also have been smuggled into Iran amid unrest there.",

And nobody's better at creating this leverage than President Trump. You know, he's shown these -- the high tariffs, and here's the stick. This is where the tariffs can go. And the carrot is \"Come to us, take off your tariffs, take off your non-tariff trade barriers, stop manipulating your currency, stop subsidizing labor and capital and then we can talk.\"",
      "On how long negotiations with China, other countries will take",
      "Raddatz: According to Bloomberg, you said a comprehensive deal between the U.S. and China could happen in two to three years. Trump said a deal will come quickly. You've heard him say that. You said, obviously, it was going to be a slog. So how long do you think?",
      "Bessent: Well, look, I think that there is a path here. So the first path will be, again, a deescalation, which I think the Chinese are going to have to have. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle, these 17 or 18 important trade deals that we're negotiating, the actual papering of the trade deal. A trade deal can take months, but an agreement in principle and the good behavior and staying within the parameter of the deal by our trading partners can keep the tariffs there from ratcheting back to the maximum level, sure.",
      "On investors' confidence in the U.S. economy",
      "Raddatz: And it's very rare, I think it happened a couple times in the '70s, for the dollars, stocks and bonds to get hit as hard as they simultaneously did over the last few weeks. If the goal is to get countries to stand with us against China, does it worry you at all that investors seem to be losing confidence in the U.S.?",
      "Bessent: Well, again, you're saying losing confidence. And the -- I don't think that this is necessarily losing confidence. And anything -- I've been in the markets for 35, 40 years. Anything that happens over a two-week, one-month window can be either statistical noise or market noise. And they -- you know, we're in this for the long term. And the important thing is that we are setting the fundamentals for a strong dollar, a strong economy, a strong stock market, and for investors to know that they -- that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world.",

      "\"Thank you to @SecretService @ICE and our law enforcement partners for finding and arresting the criminal who stole my bag on Easter Sunday as I shared a meal with my family at a Washington DC restaurant,\" Noem posted on X.",

      "Noem said in her post that the person arrested is \"a career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, so many families in this country have been made victims by crime, and that\u2019s why President Trump is working every single day to make America safe and get these criminal aliens off of our streets,\" she said.",
      "Later Sunday, the Secret Service said it had made two arrests in the case -- one in Washington and one in Miami.",
      "The Secret Service said the defendant arrested in D.C., who it didn't identify, is a serial offender and said the theft \"had no protective nexus to Secretary Noem or her role as Secretary of Homeland Security.\" It also said its investigation revealed alleged potential device and credit card fraud and would maintain jurisdiction over the case.",
      "The person arrested in Miami is believed to be a co-conspirator with the first person in a pattern of thefts and robberies in D.C. and is believed to be the primary defendant in stealing Noem's bag, the Secret Service said. The person is being held on an immigration detainer and their name will be released when charges are finalized, the Secret Service said.",
      "In an interview on Thursday, Noem said she thought the theft was \"professionally done.\"",

      "Noem said she wasn't sure if she was targeted because she was the DHS secretary. She said she felt something brush against her leg where the bag was at her feet, but thought it was one of her grandchildren.",

      "\"Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren -- she was using the cash withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts,\" the official said.",

    "story": [
      "He told Time magazine negotiations would be \"finished\" in 3-4 weeks.",
      "President Donald Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine published Friday, claimed he's already \"made 200 deals\" on tariffs and said he's spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "In the cover story, in which Trump's discussed his first 100 days in office, the president was asked about White House trade adviser Peter Navarro\u2019s prediction of \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ve made 200 deals,\" Trump said. When asked to confirm that number, Trump said \"100%.\"",
      "Trump, though, would not elaborate on what countries he's solidified deals with or the terms. He's met with various foreign officials at the White House in recent weeks on tariffs and other economic issues, but has not yet announced any agreements.",
      "\"I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way,\" Trump told Time. \"We'll be finished.\"",
      "On the issue of China -- which faces the highest tariff rate from the administration -- Trump said President Xi has called him.",
      "\"He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf,\" Trump said.",
      "The White House in recent days has softened its stance on China, telling reporters that talks with Beijing were moving in the right direction. But Chinese officials, before Trump's Time interview was published, disputed the White House's characterization.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Thursday called the administration's claims active discussions were happening \"fake news.\" On Friday, the Jiakun said \"China and the United States have not consulted or negotiated on the tariff issue\" and \"the United States should not confuse the public.\"",
      "As he left the White House on Friday, Trump was pressed multiple times by reporters to elaborate on the call with Xi he mentioned to Time but sidestepped. When asked specifically if he'd spoken to him since the tariffs, Trump said, \"I don't want to comment on that but I've spoken to him many times.\"",
      "Here are other key takeaways from the Time interview.",
      "Deportations and Kilmar Abrego Garcia",
      "Time reported that the idea of Trump sending migrants to El Salvador started back in the summer of 2024, when Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele invited lawmakers to visit the country's infamous CECOT. Matt Gaetz, then a Republican congressman from Florida, pitched the idea to Stephen Miller, who then floated the idea to Trump, according to Time, and a deal was quietly made in February.",
      "Trump told Time he liked the idea, in part, because he believed it would be \"a greater deterrent.\"",
      "Trump also told Time that he was originally \u201cnot happy\u201d that his administration had \u201cmistakenly\u201d deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia under the Alien Enemies Act, but then \"found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member.\" Abrego Garcia's family and attorney deny that claim.",
      "Trump said he has not asked Bukele to return Abrego Garcia despite the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.",
      "Asked if Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court, Trump repeatedly said it's up to the Justice Department, but eventually said it wouldn\u2019t bother him if he received his due process.",
      "\"That\u2019s not my determination,\" Trump said. \"It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer.\"",
      "Russia-Ukraine war",
      "President Trump again blamed Kyiv for initiating the war they are in with Russia, saying Ukraine's desire to join NATO was to blame despite Russian President Vladimir Putin launching a full-scale invasion.",
      "Amid recent comments from Trump and other top officials that the U.S. could walk away from negotiations if a deal isn't reached soon, Trump projected optimism.",
      "\"We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal,\" he told Time.",
      "The negotiated peace Trump is pursuing would hand Putin some 20% of Ukrainian territory.",
      "\u201cCrimea will stay with Russia,\u201d Trump told the magazine.",
      "Trump was asked about his repeated comments of ending the war in Ukraine on Day 1 of his presidency. Trump argued he meant that \u201cfiguratively.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended.\u201d",

      "Dugan was charged with two criminal counts of \"obstructing and impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States\" and \"concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest,\" according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday.",
      "County court records show the undocumented immigrant in the Milwaukee case -- Eduardo Flores-Ruiz -- was set to appear in court on April 18 before Dugan for a pretrial conference in a case where he has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of battery/domestic abuse connected to an incident on March 12. The case is ongoing.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege Flores-Ruiz illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico and was issued an Expedited Removal order in January 2013, according to a criminal complaint.",
      "Bondi alleged that Flores-Ruiz beat his roommate and a woman so badly that they needed to be hospitalized and that he continued to be belligerent in the hospital before his arrest.",
      "According to the complaint, Dugan allegedly sought to help Flores-Ruiz evade arrest by federal officers from an ICE task force.",
      "When Judge Dugan learned ICE officers were present in court to arrest Flores-Ruiz, she became \"visibly angry\" and said the situation was \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and entering her chambers, according to the complaint, which cited witnesses who spoke to the FBI.",
      "Dugan and another unidentified judge then allegedly approached the arrest team in the public hallway, according to the complaint. She was \"visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor\" and asked one of the officers whether they were present for a court appearance, the complaint alleged.",
      "When the officer replied they were there to make an arrest, the complaint alleges Judge Dugan asked if they had a judicial warrant, to which the officer responded, \"No I have an administrative warrant.\"",
      "Multiple witnesses cited in the complaint later allegedly said Judge Dugan returned to her courtroom after directing members of the arrest team to the office of the court's chief judge.",
      "\"The courtroom deputy then saw Judge DUGAN get up and heard Judge DUGAN say something like 'Wait, come with me,'\" the complaint states. \"Despite having been advised of the administrative warrant for the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Judge DUGAN then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the 'jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse.\"",
      "\"So she continues, continues with her docket, finishes her docket. Two victims sit in court all morning long waiting and at the end. The prosecutors say 'What happened? Why didn't the case get called?'\" Bondi said.",
      "A DEA agent saw Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the public hallway of the courthouse and he appeared to be making efforts to evade arrest, the complaint says. After he was encountered by FBI and DEA agents outside the building, Flores-Ruiz \"turned around and sprinted down the street\" before he was ultimately apprehended, according to the complaint.",
      "Dugan was arrested Friday morning at the courthouse, a law enforcement official confirmed to ABC News.",
      "She appeared in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on Friday on the two charges, but did not enter a plea. She was released on her own recognizance.",

      "\"They didn't get it because she let a criminal defendant walk out a door. She helped them. She obstructed justice,\" Bondi told Phillips.",
      "Judge Dugan's arrest angered Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who accused the federal agents of \"showboating\" and contended Dugan was not a flight risk.",

      "The Trump administration has promised to restore funding to a landmark study on women's health days after researchers leading the study announced their funding had been cut -- news that prompted outcry from medical experts and scientists.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Friday to ABC News that it will restore funding to the Women's Health Initiative, a 30-year study of over 160,000 women that has led to discoveries in women's health on everything from cancer and hormone therapy to chronic disease, aging and osteoporosis.",
      "\"These studies represent critical contributions to our better understanding of women's health. While NIH initially exceeded its internal targets for contract reductions, we are now working to fully restore funding to these essential research efforts,\" the agency said in a statement, referring to the National Institutes of Health, the agency within HHS that oversees the study. \"The NIH remains deeply committed to advancing public health through rigorous gold standard research and we are taking immediate steps to ensure the continuity of these studies.\"",
      "Researchers leading the Women's Health Initiative, or WHI, announced earlier this week that they had been informed HHS would terminate contracts for the study's four regional centers at the end of September. Funding for the study's clinical coordinating center would continue through January 2026, according to the researchers, and then remain uncertain.",
      "Garnet Anderson, Ph.D., principal investigator of the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, told ABC News on Friday that the center has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study will be restored.",
      "She added that while she hopes the funding for the WHI is restored, she is also worried that it may come at the expense of funding for \"other, equally deserving studies.\"",
      "\"The decision-making process now is opaque,\" Anderson told ABC News by email. \"It isn't clear that we are getting the best return on our investment -- prioritizing and supporting research on the most important issues in public health and the most promising scientific opportunities.\"",
      "Anderson's work on the WHI over the past 30 years included research on hormone therapy and women.",
      "Additional discoveries stemming from the decades' worth of data collected by the WHI include major information on preventing chronic disease in women; slowing memory loss; preventing and treating breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers in women; and better understanding of how conditions earlier in life like pregnancy, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes impact women later in life, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, one of the long-term principal investigators of the WHI.",
      "\"This is the largest and most groundbreaking study of women's health, and we're learning so much about prevention of chronic disease, healthy aging, extending health span, years of life that are free of major chronic diseases with good memory and cognition and mobility, and quality of life,\" Manson, who is also Preventive Medicine division chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Manson said the research findings the WHI continues to produce have not only shaped public health guidelines and clinical health guidelines, meaning the medical advice doctors give to patients, but have also shaped a generation of researchers of women's health.",
      "\"There have been more than 5,000 investigators who have been involved with publications and with the science, and it will be difficult to keep that together,\" she said of the potential impact of the funding cuts. \"Also, the WHI has played an enormous role in training and mentoring the next generation of researchers in women's health and healthy aging that is likely to be disrupted.\"",

      "\"We've got blood samples, literally hundreds of thousands of blood samples, that have been collected over the years. It isn't clear if those bio-specimens can be fully utilized and used to advance the science that is also threatened,\" Manson said, later adding, \"We need to see whether these bio-specimens can be preserved, whether they can still be made available for ancillary study by investigators around the country, whether new biomarkers can be measured in these blood samples -- it's really unclear.\"",
      "On Friday, Manson told ABC News that she has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study would continue.",
      "A third WHI regional center, located at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, also told ABC News Friday it had not been informed by the NIH of a decision to restore funding.",
      "Dr. Marian Neuhouser, a principal investigator of the WHI at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said one of the primary duties of the study's regional centers, whose funding was originally set to be terminated in September, is to continually collect data from the tens of thousands of women still enrolled in the study.",
      "\"There aren't many studies that have such a large database of older women. We have something like 13,000 women over the age of 90 and some up to age 108,\" Neuhouser told ABC News on Thursday. \"We need to learn about these women -- what keeps them healthy, what puts them at risk, how people can remain living independently. This information helps clinicians as they interact with patients.\"",
      "She added of the women enrolled in the WHI, \"They want to be studied. They want to be part of the answer.\"",
      "Experts like Neuhouser note that the work of the WHI is landmark in part because as recently as three decades ago, women were not required to be included in medical research.",
      "In the 1970s, for example, the first clinical studies on the effects of estrogen -- the sex hormone responsible for female physical features and reproduction -- were done on men.",
      "It was only with the passage of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act in 1993, signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton, that the inclusion of women and people of color became required in federally funded research.",

    "summary": "Seven in 10 Americans think Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on international trade will drive up U.S. inflation, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 47% of Republicans think tariffs will negatively impact inflation.",
      "Seven in 10 Americans think President Donald Trump's tariffs on international trade will drive up U.S. inflation, outweighing hopes that they'll boost manufacturing employment and fueling a 64% disapproval rate of how he's handling the issue.",
      "Even nearly half of Republicans -- 47% in the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Friday -- said they think tariffs will negatively impact inflation. That jumps to 75% among independents, a swing group in national politics.",
      "The tariffs admittedly are a moving target. The administration has paused some (albeit not those on China) pending negotiations.",
      "And there is a perceived positive: 59% said they think the tariffs will have a positive impact on creating manufacturing jobs in the United States, including 90% of Republicans and 60% of independents. That, along with bringing prices down, were some of Trump's key campaign promises.",
      "But -- given the current state of play -- the scale tips negative again on a third factor: 56% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, think Trump's handling of tariffs will negatively impact America's economic leadership in the world vs. 42% who see a positive impact.",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "Democrats, for their part, are roundly opposed to the tariffs. Nine in 10 think they will negatively impact inflation (90%) and U.S. economic leadership in the world (89%) alike, and a near-unanimous 96% disapprove of Trump's handling of them. Democrats aren't sold on tariffs creating manufacturing jobs, either: 68% think they'll hurt, not help.",
      "Given inflation fears, Trump's overall rating for handling tariffs is a broad 30 percentage points underwater, 34%-64%. That's far worse than his 7-point deficit in approval on handling immigration (as reported here), demonstrating that public sentiment is especially prickly when economic well-being is on the line.",
      "Indeed, in his own party, 25% of Republicans disapprove of Trump's handling of tariffs, as do 30% of conservatives. And disapproval reaches 48% among non-college-educated white men and 47% of rural Americans, two of Trump's core support groups.",
      "Methodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults. Partisan divisions are 30%-30%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.",
      "Results have a margin of error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect. Error margins are larger for subgroups. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.",

      "Former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr is set to stand trial in the death of Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year old man and Congolese immigrant who was shot and killed by the officer three years ago",
      "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- The trial of a former Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder in the killing of a 26-year-old Black man is set to begin in Grand Rapids, three years after the case sparked weeks of protest and national outrage.",
      "Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant who sought refuge with his family in the U.S. to flee violence in his home country, was fatally shot by former officer Christopher Schurr, who is white.",
      "Lyoya was shot in the back of the head while facedown on the ground following a traffic stop. Schurr\u2019s attorneys argue he acted in self-defense.",
      "Opening statements in the trial begin Monday in downtown Grand Rapids and the trial is expected to last at least a week.",
      "Here is what to know.",
      "Schurr pulled over a vehicle driven by Lyoya over improper license plates on a rainy morning April 4, 2022, in a Grand Rapids residential neighborhood.",
      "Body camera footage and dash camera footage shows Lyoya run from Schurr after the officer asks for his driver's license. Schurr tackles Lyoya and a struggle ensues as Schurr attempts to shoot his Taser at Lyoya.",
      "Schurr\u2019s body camera footage appears to show Lyoya reaching for the officer\u2019s Taser. The body camera footage goes out before the shooting.",
      "A passenger of the vehicle recorded a video. The cellphone footage shows the officer tell Lyoya to let go of the Taser multiple times.",
      "While Lyoya is facedown on the ground and Schurr is on top of him, the officer takes out his firearm and shoots Lyoya in the back of the head.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s family has said he came to the U.S. to get away from prolonged civil unrest involving several rebel groups vying for control of territories in the mineral-rich eastern Congo. He was raising two children in Grand Rapids, a city of around 200,000 people located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.",
      "After fleeing violence back home, Lyoya ultimately joined a list of names of Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S. only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement.",
      "Before him, there was Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima, all men whose cases increased awareness around the global impact of systemic racism in policing.",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who eulogized Lyoya at his 2022 funeral, noted then that Lyoya was killed on April 4, the anniversary of the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Lyoya came to America in search of a better life and \u201cran into an America that we know too well,\u201d Sharpton said.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s killing prompted weeks of protest in the west Michigan city and calls to reform the police department.",
      "Schurr, now 34, was fired by the police department shortly after he was charged with one count of second-degree murder in June 2022.",
      "He had worked for the department for seven years.",
      "Schurr has said he acted in self-defense while prosecutors say the use of lethal force was unnecessary and excessive. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "The role of the Taser is likely to play a significant role in Schurr's defense. Prosecutors have argued the Taser already had been deployed and therefore did not pose a threat to Schurr.",
      "Tasers are generally considered non-lethal by police but the narrative often flips when handled by someone who is not law enforcement, said Ian Adams, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina.",
      "Whether Schurr gave proper warning of his use of lethal force also will likely be of note to the jury, Adams said.",
      "\u201cIn the video, you can hear the officer say, \u2018Drop the taser,\u2019 which is a command,\" Adams said. \u201cBut whether or not it\u2019s a warning that an officer is about to use lethal force is going to be contested.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a highly salient case in U.S. policing right now,\u201d Adams said.",
      "Charles Joe Key, who has testified as a consulting witness in police use of force in a different Michigan case, said the Taser can still cause pain and could have incapacitated Schurr even after it had been discharged. Key expected the physical struggle the two engaged in will likely be another factor of Schurr\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cGiven the officer's continued attempts to have the person quit, let go of the Taser, etcetera, then it would be a reasonable analysis by the officer that the person would continue to fight,\u201d Key said.",

      "NEW YORK -- A Brooklyn woman said she feared for her life as she was chased, kicked, spit at and pelted with objects by a mob of Orthodox Jewish men who mistook her as a participant in a protest against Israel\u2019s far-right security minister.",
      "The assault, recorded by a bystander, unfolded Thursday near the global headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in Crown Heights, where an appearance by Itamar Ben-Gvir set off clashes between pro-Palestinian activists and members of the neighborhood\u2019s large Orthodox Jewish community.",
      "The woman, a neighborhood resident in her 30s, told The Associated Press she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.",
      "\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\" she said.",
      "As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.",
      "Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.",
      "\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d",
      "At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.",
      "\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d",
      "After several blocks, the officer hustled the woman into a police vehicle, prompting one man to yell, \u201cGet her!\u201d The crowd erupted in cheers as she was driven away.",
      "The woman, a lifelong New Yorker, said she was left with bruises and mentally shaken by the episode, which she said police should investigate as an act of hate.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid to move around the neighborhood where I\u2019ve lived for a decade,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like anyone in any position of power really cares.\u201d",
      "A police spokesperson said one person was arrested and five others were issued summons following the demonstration, but did not say whether anyone involved in assaulting the woman was charged.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams said Sunday that police were investigating \u201ca series of incidents stemming from clashing protests on Thursday that began when a group of anti-Israel protesters surrounded the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters \u2014 a Jewish house of worship \u2014 in Brooklyn.\u201d",
      "He said police had spoken to a different woman on the pro-Palestinian side of the protest who suffered injuries after she was harassed by counter-protesters. Photos shared online showed that woman with blood streaming down her face.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: None of this is acceptable, in fact, it is despicable,\u201d Adams added. \u201cNew York City will always be a place where people can peacefully protest, but we will not tolerate violence, trespassing, menacing, or threatening.\u201d",
      "The protest was one of several in recent days against Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist settler leader who is embarking on his first U.S. state visit since joining Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet three years ago.",
      "Previously convicted in Israel of racist incitement and support for a terrorist group, he has called on his supporters to confront Palestinians and assert \u201cJewish Power.\"",
      "The protest against Ben-Gvir\u2019s Brooklyn appearance generated condemnations from some Jewish groups, who accused participants of targeting a religious site.",
      "The neighborhood around the Chabad headquarters also was the site of the 1991 Crown Heights riot, in which Black residents outraged by boy's death in a crash involving a rabbi's motorcade attacked Jews, homes and businesses for three days.",
      "A Chabad-Lubavitch spokesman, Rabbi Motti Seligson, denounced both the anti-Ben-Gvir protesters and the mob that chased the woman.",
      "\u201cThe violent provocateurs who called for the genocide of Jews in support of terrorists and terrorism \u2014 outside a synagogue, in a Jewish neighborhood, where some of the worst antisemitic violence in American history was perpetrated, and where many residents share deep bonds with the victims of Oct 7 \u2014 did so in order to intimidate, provoke, and instill fear,\u201d Seligson said.",
      "\u201cWe condemn the crude language and violence of the small breakaway group of young people; such actions are entirely unacceptable and wholly antithetical to the Torah\u2019s values. The fact that a possibly uninvolved bystander got pulled into the melee further underscores the point,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in a years-long legal battle over an FBI raid on the wrong Atlanta house",
      "ATLANTA -- Before dawn on Oct. 18, 2017, FBI agents broke down the front door of Trina Martin's Atlanta home, stormed into her bedroom and pointed guns at her and her then-boyfriend as her 7-year-old son screamed for his mom from another room.",
      "Martin, blocked from comforting her son, cowered in disbelief for what she said felt like an eternity. But within minutes, the ordeal was over. The agents realized they had the wrong house.",
      "On Tuesday, an attorney for Martin will go before the U.S. Supreme Court to ask the justices to reinstate her 2019 lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the agents of assault and battery, false arrest and other violations.",
      "A federal judge in Atlanta dismissed the suit in 2022 and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision last year. The Supreme Court agreed in January to take up the matter.",
      "The key issue before the justices is under what circumstances people can sue the federal government in an effort to hold law enforcement accountable. Martin's attorneys say Congress clearly allowed for those lawsuits in 1974, after a pair of law enforcement raids on wrong houses made headlines, and blocking them would leave little recourse for families like her.",
      "FBI Atlanta spokesperson Tony Thomas said in an email the agency can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. But lawyers for the government argued in Martin's case that courts shouldn\u2019t be \u201csecond-guessing\u201d law enforcement decisions. The FBI agents did advance work and tried to find the right house, making this raid fundamentally different from the no-knock, warrantless raids that led Congress to act in the 1970s, the Justice Department said in court filings starting under the Biden administration.",
      "In dismissing Martin's case, the 11th Circuit largely agreed with that argument, saying courts can't second-guess police officers who make \u201chonest mistakes\u201d in searches. The agent who led the raid said his personal GPS led him to the wrong place. The FBI was looking for a suspected gang member a few houses away.",
      "Martin, 46, said she, her then-boyfriend, Toi Cliatt, and her son were left traumatized.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be the same, mentally, emotionally, psychologically,\u201d she said Friday at the neat, stucco home that was raided. \u201cMentally, you can suppress it, but you can\u2019t really get over it.\u201d",
      "She and Cliatt pointed out where they were sleeping when the agents broke in and the master bathroom closet where they hid.",
      "Martin stopped coaching track because the starting pistol reminded her of the flashbang grenade the agents set off. Cliatt, 54, said he couldn\u2019t sleep, forcing him to leave his truck driving job.",
      "\u201cThe road is hypnotizing,\" he said of driving tired. \"I became a liability to my company.\u201d",
      "Martin said her son became extremely anxious, pulling threads out of his clothes and peeling paint off walls.",
      "Cliatt initially thought the raid was a burglary attempt, so he ran toward the closet, where he kept a shotgun. Martin said her son still expresses fear that she could have died had she confronted the agents while armed.",
      "\u201cIf the Federal Tort Claims Act provides a cause of action for anything, it\u2019s a wrong-house raid like the one the FBI conducted here,\u201d Martin's lawyers wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.",
      "Other U.S. appeals courts have interpreted the law more favorably for victims of mistaken law enforcement raids, creating conflicting legal standards that only the nation\u2019s highest court can resolve, they say.

    "story": [
      "U.S. states are adopting and expanding programs that use taxpayer money to pay for private schools even as their costs rise and budget pictures become more uncertain",
      "State lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to use more taxpayer dollars to pay for private school tuitions and homeschooling expenses even as they try to figure out how to budget in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "A $1 billion-per-year voucher program the Texas Legislature sent to the governor last week and a longshot push in Congress to expand vouchers nationally, including to states that have rejected them, are focusing attention on the issue.",
      "In states that already have programs to pay private education costs for most students, the expense has quickly gobbled up more of their budgets as revenue growth has slowed or stalled. Besides Texas, Tennessee adopted a program this year, and North Dakota gave serious consideration to one before a veto last week likely ended its prospects this year.",
      "States are required to produce annual spending plans that don't exceed what they bring in. With pandemic-era federal money mostly phased out, voucher opponents fear the programs will come at the expense of other priorities, including public schools.",
      "\u201cEven if they\u2019re being funded by separate revenue sources, it can feel like school choice programs and public schools are competing for the same slice of an increasingly smaller pie,\u201d said Page Forrest, who analyzes state finances at the nonpartisan think tank Pew.",
      "Until five years ago, the boldest school choice programs were limited to lower-income and special-needs students. More recently, scholarships and state-funded savings accounts open to most or all families have been catching on, especially in Republican-controlled states.",
      "This approach costs far more, at least in the short term. That is partly because studies of the efforts in several states have found most of the first students to enroll were already attending private schools, and not receiving taxpayer subsidies at all before the choice programs' launch.",
      "In the coming school year, voucher programs are expected to cost Florida taxpayers almost $3.9 billion, or about $1 in every $13 from the state\u2019s general revenue fund. In Arizona, it\u2019s nearly 5% of the general budget.",
      "An analysis by The Associated Press found the costs in Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma are over 3% of state general spending this year, or are projected to be in the coming budget year.",
      "Spending is a smaller portion of the budget in states where the scholarship programs are still ramping up. Those include Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.",
      "A flood of campaign money from voucher proponents has been a key factor in convincing previously resistant Republican lawmakers to endorse school choice plans, particularly as advocates have called for more school options coming out of the COVID pandemic.",
      "Programs were approved last year in Alabama and Louisiana and this year in Tennessee, where Republican Gov. Bill Lee has said the $447 million program will be available for the upcoming school year.",
      "A New Hampshire bill raising income limits on an existing program has been moving through the legislature.",
      "In Texas on Thursday, lawmakers sent the governor a bill that would allot more than $10,000 per year for students in accredited private schools. The cost would be capped at $1 billion in the 2026-27 school year, which is a little over 1% of the annual state general funding. But by 2030, a legislative analysis found, it could cost $4.5 billion a year. That could partially be offset by a little over $800 million in savings, because there would be fewer public school students to subsidize.",
      "The Texas House also approved a nearly $8 billion boost to the public education system, which advocates say doesn't cover extra expenses due to inflation.",
      "In energy-dependent North Dakota, GOP Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed an education savings account program, saying it wouldn't expand options for all students and there were implementation problems. He has since said the concept remains a priority for him.",
      "Erin Oban, an organizer with North Dakotans for Public Schools, said the program's costs and unknowns about the state's financial outlook make it a bad time to start a voucher program.",
      "\"I think it would be a very long-term challenge to fund something in the short term you think might be a good idea or that somehow we can afford right now,\u201d she said.",
      "Congressional Republicans are looking to extend an assortment of tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, plus enact new tax cuts for overtime, tips and Social Security benefits. Proponents of the school choice credit will face stiff competition when it comes to getting included in that mix.",
      "In Ohio, under a budget proposed by House Republicans, vouchers would see a bigger funding increase than public schools starting in July 2026. The plan, which was passed this month, also calls for a way for the state to take back some property tax money already collected by school districts.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney said she doesn\u2019t have a problem with vouchers, so long as public schools are fully funded. But she says the budget plan falls short of that.",
      "It also would continue to increase the amount available for scholarships to private schools, including for the first time making a portion of them available to institutions that operate without any state oversight.",
      "\u201cNinety percent of Ohio\u2019s kids are still in the public schools,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThey are increasing still more into vouchers while still not giving the public schools what they need \u2014 even though that\u2019s where the bulk of the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Rachel Brady, a mother of four in Wake Forest, North Carolina, was a leader in a successful push last year for lawmakers to fully fund scholarships after one of her children, and thousands of others, were put on a waiting list after the initial allocation was exhausted.",
      "Lawmakers should look to cut costs elsewhere if they have to in order to keep the programs going, she said.",
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein \u2014 like Arizona's Katie Hobbs, another Democratic governor \u2014 has proposed scaling back the scholarships. But there is no indication the GOP-controlled legislatures will pump the brakes in either state.",
      "The budget advanced this month by the North Carolina House includes scholarship funding and a smaller raise for public school teachers than Stein proposed.",
      "\u201cThis is a great investment in the future of our kids,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving them what they need to be successful in life. I can\u2019t think of a better way to invest in the future of our state.\u201d",

      "\u201c\u201dWe have a lot of fishing and boating, but we also have a lot of just plain tourists coming through to see the dam,\" Broyhill said of Pickstown, located a little more than a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) east of the dam on the Missouri River, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) north of the Nebraska state line.",

      "In western Kansas, Sue Graham, manager of Knothead\u2019s bait shop and camping supply store on the east side of Wilson Lake, was skeptical of a plan to limit a campsite there to daytime use as of May 15. The lake is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Kansas City, home to the Corps district office for parts of Kansas, Missouri and southern Nebraska.",
      "Graham doesn't think the move will save much money because the campsite is used only by residents who own boat ramps nearby, but Corps officials would \u201cshoot themselves in the foot\u201d if they went further because of lost fee revenues, she said, adding that she does not expect her shop to be affected.",
      "\u201cPeople are still going to come out,\u201d Graham said.",
      "The Kansas City district plans to close visitor information centers at two Kansas lakes including Hillsdale, outside the Kansas City area, and Kanopolis, in central Kansas. The Corps will not allow overnight camping in 25 \u201cprimitive,\u201d no-amenities spots in two areas at Harlan County Lake in western Nebraska near the Kansas state line. The sites and water nearby still will be accessible during the day.",
      "Emily Coffin, the district's natural resource section chief, said the district has pursued efficiency initiatives for five or six years that will lead to fewer visitor-staff interactions. They include self-service campsite registrations, cashless parking and payments through codes scanned with smartphones.",
      "\u201cIt just may be a little bit more noticeable because we have more of that built on than maybe we did two years ago,\u201d she said.",
      "In March, the Corps' Baltimore district closed three campgrounds at Raystown Lake in central Pennsylvania and a campground, swimming beach and boat ramp at Cowanesque Lake in northern Pennsylvania.",

      "Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official.

      "Chris Murphy has been touring the country talking to voters, and some people are starting to view the Democratic senator from Connecticut as worthy of the national spotlight",
      "SAXAPAHAW, N.C. -- Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy isn\u2019t drawing stadium-size crowds like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are as he tours the country talking to voters. But in a packed concert hall in rural North Carolina, people are starting to view the Democrat as worthy of the national spotlight.",
      "Murphy and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., have been staging events in Republican congressional districts in recent weeks, trolling GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Richard Hudson, who represents the area they visited Thursday. Hudson, the chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, has discouraged Republicans from holding town halls, so Murphy and Frost decided to hold one on his home turf in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the job that these Republican congressmen and senators won\u2019t do,\u201d Murphy told the hyped-up crowd of mostly older voters at the event, while acknowledging that Democrats need to do more to soothe their anxiety and counter President Donald Trump. \u201cI want to make sure that everywhere, in every corner of this country, people are willing to stand up and fight.\u201d",
      "As other Democrats grasp for a response to Trump\u2019s election, unsure of how to confront him, Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a sustained blitz of television appearances, fundraising appeals, Senate floor speeches and events like the one in North Carolina. He also is talking directly to voters on social media, including through lengthy live videos on Instagram where he sits in his kitchen with a cocktail and tries to explain what he sees as \u201cthe central story\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 \u201cthe billionaire takeover of our government made possible by the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "It's a methodical approach for Murphy, 51, a serious-minded legislator who has been most well known for his yearslong fight to stem gun violence in the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 first-grade students and six educators.",
      "While the kitchen talks on Instagram seem to come more naturally to Murphy than riling up a crowd, his message is clearly resonating with his party's base of voters, many of whom are angry at Democrats in Washington for inaction. He raised around $8 million in the first quarter of the year, a significant sum that could rival the totals for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who have been drawing much larger crowds on a tour together.",
      "\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not Bernie Sanders,\u201d Murphy said in an interview after the event in Saxapahaw. \u201cI\u2019m not going to draw 70,000 people. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t still have an obligation to try to go out and support a national mobilization.\u201d",
      "Frustration with the Democratic Party\u2019s leaders came to a boil last month, with most of the anger directed at Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who voted for a Republican bill to keep the government open just as the base was hoping to see more fight from their elected officials. Murphy was strongly against the bill, even if opposing it meant Democrats would trigger a government shutdown.",
      "\u201cI think when people see us engaged in risk adverse behavior, then they are much less likely to show up for rallies to ultimately engage in the kind of civil disobedience we might need to save the democracy,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "His fundraising haul, and his barrage of media and events, begs questions about his future ambitions. But it is unclear where Murphy\u2019s moment might lead. He insists that he is not thinking about a presidential bid or a future in Senate leadership after the No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, announced this week that he will retire next year.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that my content is breaking through and more people are listening to me at a time when I\u2019m not getting up every day thinking about my personal political future,\u201d said Murphy, who was reelected to the Senate last year.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an election in 2028 if we don\u2019t win this fight right now. So it seems kind of silly to think about anything other than the emergency that exists today. I\u2019m not trying to avoid the question. It\u2019s not a cop out. That is legitimately what drives me.\u201d",
      "Ron Osborne, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Alamance County, where Thursday\u2019s event was located, said he had not previously considered Murphy a major contender for the presidency in 2028. But \u201che\u2019s doing the right things,\" Osborne said.",
      "\"He is speaking out where others could do the same thing and have not,\u201d Osborne said, and \u201cthat takes courage.\u201d",
      "Terry Greenlund, a 78-year-old Democrat who was also in the audience, said he thinks Murphy \u201chas a way of talking with people.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s time for a new generation to move in with some new views and insight and energy,\u201d Greenlund said, echoing many others in the room.",
      "Murphy, 51 and the father of two teenagers, seems to be enjoying the attention. He joked at the event that he may not be as \u201ccool\u201d as Frost, who is the youngest member of Congress at 28. But Murphy is still decades younger than many of his colleagues, who have controlled the party for years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to be dad cool,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Murphy was in Missouri on Friday after visiting a Republican district in Michigan with Frost last month. And they are not the only Democrats venturing into red states. In addition to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have also recently traveled to talk to voters in Republican areas.",
      "Murphy said he does not want to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d with his fundraising haul, but he does not want to sit on it, either. He said he plans to help organizations mobilize voters before the 2026 midterm elections and also put pressure on Republicans as they try to push tax and spending cuts through Congress.",
      "\u201cThe only way that history tells us that you stop an elected leader from converting a country away from democracy is mass mobilization,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Our party has made mistakes, and if we don\u2019t learn from those mistakes,\" Murphy said, \u201cwe're cooked.\u201d",

      "An AP-NORC poll finds many Americans don't agree with President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to quickly enact his agenda, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly convinced his attention has been in the right place",
      "WASHINGTON -- Many Americans do not agree with President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to quickly enact his agenda, a new poll finds, and even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that his attention has been in the right place.",
      "Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he has been focusing on the right ones, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Further, about 4 in 10 Americans say Trump has been a \u201cterrible\u201d president in his second term, and about 1 in 10 say he has been \u201cpoor.\u201d In contrast, about 3 in 10 say he has been \u201cgreat or \u201dgood,\u201d while just under 2 in 10 say he has been \u201caverage.\u201d",
      "Most haven\u2019t been shocked by the drama of Trump\u2019s first 100 days. About 7 in 10 U.S. adults say the first few months of Trump\u2019s second term have been mostly what they expected, and only about 3 in 10 say the Republican president\u2019s actions have been mostly unexpected.",
      "But that does not mean they are pleased with how those opening months have gone.",
      "In fact, Democrats seem even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in on Jan. 20. About three-quarters of Democrats say Trump is focused on the wrong topics and about 7 in 10 think he has been a \u201cterrible\u201d president so far. That is an increase from January, when about 6 in 10 anticipated that he would be \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "Rahsaan Henderson, a Democrat from California, said \u201cit has been one of the longest 100 days I\u2019ve ever had to sit through.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the next four years will be a test of seeing who can resist the most and continue defying whatever he\u2019s trying to do, since he defies everything, including the Supreme Court,\u201d said Henderson, 40.",
      "Republicans are largely standing behind the president, but are ambivalent about what he has chosen to emphasize. About 7 in 10 say he has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president. But only about half say he has mostly had the right priorities so far, while about one-quarter say it has been about an even mix and about 1 in 10 said Trump has mostly had the wrong priorities.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really doing the stuff that he said he was going to do,\u201d said Tanner Bergstrom, 29, a Republican from Minnesota. He is \u201cnot making a bunch of promises and getting into office and nothing happens. ... I really like that. Even if it\u2019s some stuff I don\u2019t agree with, it\u2019s still doing what he said he was going to do.\u201d",
      "Those who were surprised by Trump\u2019s first few months seem to have had a rude awakening. The people who say Trump\u2019s actions were not what they expected \u2014 who are mostly Democrats and independents \u2014 are more likely to say Trump has had mostly the wrong priorities and that he has been a poor or terrible president, compared with the people who mostly expected his actions.",
      "About 4 in 10 in the survey approve of how Trump is handling the presidency overall. The issue of immigration is a relative strength. According to the poll, 46% of U.S. adults approve of his handling of the issue, which is slightly higher than his overall approval. But there are also indications that foreign policy, trade negotiationsand the economy could prove problematic as he aims to prove his approach will benefit the country.",
      "Trump\u2019s approval on those issues is much lower than it is on immigration. Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of how he is handling each. Republicans are less likely to approve of Trump\u2019s approach to trade and the economy than immigration.",
      "There are additional signals that some Trump supporters may not be thrilled with his performance so far. The share of Republicans who say he has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president has fallen about 10 percentage points since January. They also have grown a bit more likely to say Trump will be either \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible,\u201d although only 16% describe his first few months that way.",
      "Republican Stephanie Melnyk, 45, from Tennessee, is supportive of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency more broadly but said she did not approve of his handling of foreign affairs, particularly on the war in Ukraine. Melnyk\u2019s family emigrated from Ukraine and she said Trump is \u201ctrying for a quick fix that\u2019s not going to last\u201d and that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cis not to be trusted.\u201d",
      "Melnyk, who voted for Trump largely for his positions on immigration, said she wished the president would stay on script.",
      "\u201cHe sounds like he can be very condescending, and it sounds like my way or the highway,\u201d Melnyk said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, dude. You\u2019re not 12.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s common, though, for a president\u2019s standing to be at its best before taking office and beginning the work of governing. And Trump continues to hold high approval from Republicans.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion of Trump, roughly in line with his approval number. Among Republicans, the figure is about double: About 8 in 10 Republicans have a positive view of the president, and about the same share approves of how he is handling the presidency. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Vice President JD Vance, including about 7 in 10 Republicans.",
      "Those Republicans interviewed were particularly fond of efforts to scale back the size of the federal government led by billionaire outside adviser Elon Musk and Trump\u2019s cost-cutting initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\u201cOverall, I would have to say that I\u2019m happy with the Trump presidency,\u201d said Matthew Spencer, 30, a Republican from Texas. \u201cI think that the Department of Government Efficiency has made great strides in reducing our spending, and I also agree with putting America first. I agree with the policies he\u2019s put in as far as border protection and America standing for itself again as far as the tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only three months in, but so far, so good,\u201d said Carlos Guevara, 46, who lives in Florida. Guevara, a Republican, said DOGE has been a \u201csmash hit\u201d and on tariffs, and while there may be short-term pain, \u201cif that does encourage businesses to start manufacturing here ... then that\u2019ll wash out over time.\u201d",
      "Democrats have a much bleaker outlook on the economy than they held before Trump took office. The poll also found that the vast majority of Democrats think he has \u201cgone too far\u201d on deportations and tariffs.",
      "Gabriel Antonucci, 26, a Democrat who recently moved to South Carolina, said Trump\u2019s second term is \u201cjust a lot more ridiculous\u201d than he had anticipated.",
      "\u201cIt really seems like he is doing everything he can to make the wrong decisions,\u201d Antonucci said. \u201cThings are probably going to be worse in four years than they are right now.\u201d",

      "MUSCAT, Oman -- Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium.",
      "Iranian state television reported the talks had begun in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. However, neither Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi nor U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff offered any immediate specifics or details on the talks that they'll lead.",
      "Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman and met with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome. Araghchi then visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Video late Saturday morning showed Araghchi heading to the talks.",
      "Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. He arrived Saturday to Oman, where the talks were expected to start in the coming hours, a source familiar with Witkoff's travels told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\u201cThe Iran situation is coming out very well,\u201d Trump said on Air Force One. \u201cWe've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",
      "He added: \u201cThere are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal \u2014 a much nastier deal \u2014 and I don\u2019t want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.\u201d",
      "While Araghchi and Witkoff are again expected to speak through the Omanis, experts on both sides also will begin negotiating details of a possible deal.",
      "From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran\u2019s expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.",
      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America\u2019s efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. That demand all enrichment stop also has been repeated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "However, Iranians remain hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took over 1 million rial to buy $1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,\u201d Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. \u201cOf course we shouldn\u2019t give them everything. After all, we\u2019ve suffered a lot for this program.\u201d",

      "Russian-born scientist Kseniia Petrova has been detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement since February when she failed to declare frog embryo samples at Boston's Logan Airport",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Kseniia Petrova never imagined she would face significant immigration issues, but it has been 68 days since she was detained at the Boston airport while traveling with undeclared frog embryo samples.",
      "The Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher associate was in the United States legally. But she finds herself thrust into a detention system that has been in the national spotlight as President Donald Trump pursues his promise of mass deportations.",
      "Petrova, 30, was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana where she continues to await a judge's decision on whether she will be deported to Russia, where she fears she will be imprisoned or worse.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security accuses Petrova of knowingly breaking the law, while friends and advocates are calling for her release and saying the incident was an infraction that normally would be punishable by a fine.",
      "As Petrova spends days in a crowded dormitory awaiting her fate, her colleagues say their research, including using a one-of-a-kind cancer-detecting microscope, will be delayed or moot without the scientist who they say plays a critical role.",
      "\u201cThe truth is on my side,\u201d said Petrova, who spoke with The Associated Press on Friday in a video call from the Louisiana ICE detention center in Monroe. She held an outdated phone to one ear and pressed her fingers against the other trying to block out muffled background conversations in various languages.",
      "Behind Petrova were steel bunkbeds, a few tables, two microwaves and a television showing CNN.",
      "\u201cAlmost all our life is happening in this dorm,\u201d Petrova said.",
      "Dozens of woman walked around Petrova. She said many were Latin Americans, some who crossed the border illegally. Other immigrants had been in the country for a long time and were detained after missing a check-in with ICE. There are others who Petrova said were in the facility \"without any sense or any reason, really any point\" about why they were detained.",
      "Petrova is not aware of any other scientists in the dorm housing 99 women.",
      "Petrova described the facility's food as \"absolutely terrible\", mainly carbohydrates without fruits or vegetables. Detainees typically get an hour outside unless it's raining, a regular occurrence this time of year in the Bayou State.",
      "People spend the night shivering because the dorm is cold, the showers are painfully hot, privacy is absent and the constant noise makes it \u201chard to live,\" she said.",
      "A couple months earlier, Petrova had been vacationing in France, where she stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of a frog embryos and obtained a package of samples to be used for research.",
      "As she passed through a customs checkpoint in Boston's Logan Airport, Petrova was questioned about the samples. Petrova told the AP she didn't realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak in anything. After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being cancelled.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on X that Petrova was detained after \u201clying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.\u201d They allege messages on her phone \u201crevealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.\"",
      "Petrova's boss and mentor, Leon Peshkin, said the samples were not in any way dangerous or biohazardous.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think she did anything wrong,\u201d Peshkin told the AP. \u201cBut even if she did, at most she should have gotten a warning or maybe a fine of up to $500.\u201d",
      "Harvard said in a statement that the university \u201ccontinues to monitor the situation.\u201d",
      "Petrova has a very special scientific skill set required by the work, said Peshkin, a principal research scientist at Harvard\u2019s Department of Systems Biology who explained Petrova is assisting an investigation into the earliest stages of cell division using frog embryos.",
      "\u201cShe has made herself crucial to pretty much every project that\u2019s going on in the lab. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna continue without her,\u201d Peshkin said.",
      "Will Trim, a postdoctoral fellow and Petrova's roommate, backed the description of her scientific value. He has worked with her as she writes computer scripts to read images from a unique microscope that Trim believes has the potential to make breakthroughs in cancer detection.",
      "\u201cSome very important research will end if she\u2019s gone,\" Trim said.",
      "Trim boarded a flight to Louisiana on Friday to visit Petrova, who is allotted one visitor a week.",
      "The facility is one of nine immigration detention centers in the state, all located in the rural north or western parts of the state. Many detainees have complained of isolation as they are held long distances from their families and attorneys.",
      "Louisiana has been at the center of other high-profile immigration cases, including the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist.",
      "Like many others in detention, Petrova left her country to avoid conflict or possible political repression. She fled after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, marking the start of a bloody three-year war.",
      "\"If I go back, I am afraid I will be imprisoned because of my political position and my position against war,\u201d Petrova said.",

      "Petrova's case is being closely watched by the scientific community, with some fearing it could impact recruiting and retaining foreign scientists at U.S. universities.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a wrong perception that foreign scientists are somehow privileged to be in the United States. I feel it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Peshkin said. \u201cForeign scientists come here with gifts ... they are highly skilled experts who are in demand.

    "story": [
      "A new tribal national park in North Dakota is opening a little-seen area of the rugged Badlands to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A new tribal national park in North Dakota's rugged Badlands is opening a little-seen area of the dramatic landscape to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts, part of a Native American tribe's efforts to preserve the land and encourage recreation.",
      "The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation established Three Affiliated Tribes National Park with the purchase of 2,100 acres (850 hectares) of a former ranch adjacent to the Fort Berthold Reservation's boundaries on the south side of the Little Missouri River.",
      "The area was in the tribe's original treaty lands but a government allotment act later reduced the reservation's size, said Mary Fredericks, director of the tribe\u2019s Parks and Reserve Program. The reservation's boundaries have expanded to include the park.",
      "Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said the goal is to establish a park for cultural and recreational purposes such as canoeing, kayaking and viewing wildlife.",
      "\u201cIt's part of our history, our lands, very significant to us, the whole area,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThis is just another strong move to reacquire some of our lands and then do something very effective with it, so to speak\u201d to aid tourism and the economy through recreation.",
      "Park officials are being careful with how they plan and develop the park to be thoughtful about impacts on the landscape.",
      "\u201cThis place will be here in perpetuity and it will be better when we are done than it was when we got it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for, that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed,\u201d Park Superintendent Ethan White Calfe said.",
      "North Dakota's Badlands \u2014 the name denotes the difficult terrain \u2014 comprise a stark, erosive, colorful landscape with dramatic shapes, petrified wood and ancient fossils. The area draws hikers, campers, hunters, bicyclists and other outdoors enthusiasts.",
      "The park, which held a soft opening in September, is open only to foot traffic by a free permit online. Park officials require visitors to register their plans and hikers must park at a grass lot. By the end of the summer, organizers hope to have 10 miles (16 kilometers) of trails finished, Fredericks said.",
      "Plans to build a visitor center and campground are in the works. Park officials also intend to work on native prairie and soil restoration in the erosive environment where some native plants that thrive in the area have been pushed out by invasive species, White Calfe said.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at it as how do we help this area look like it did 300 years ago? How do we help this area heal to where it is in a lot of more of a state of equilibrium,\u201d White Calfe said.",
      "It's a beautiful and picturesque but deceptive and steep landscape, Fredericks said.",
      "The park is bisected by a state highway that drops from a flat into a rugged river bottom. People can see parts of the park while driving, but not its interior, she said.",
      "Eventually, the park could be a gateway for visitors to the reservation, Fredericks said. Outdoor recreation is available at Lake Sakakawea, which straddles the vast reservation, and nearby at Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Maah Daah Hey Trail.",
      "The MHA Nation benefits from oil development on its reservation, which helped the tribe to afford the land for the park, Fredericks said.",
      "\u201cBut in that we have to be careful and preserve and conserve,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm very, very proud of our tribal council for having the foresight to buy this land with the intent of making it into a national park ... because we don't know what's going to happen 50 years from now and what our landscape is going to look like, but we can preserve this part of it.\u201d",
      "The park neighbors Little Missouri State Park, which draws horseback riders to its 40 miles (64 kilometers) of trails in the Badlands.",
      "The rugged landscape \u201ckind of has that almost spiritual feel to it. It's peaceful,\u201d state Parks and Recreation Department Director Cody Schulz said.",
      "State park officials have worked with the tribe for about two years on its plans and partnering together, such as connecting trail systems, Schulz said. Tribal park officials are collaborating with anyone willing, Fredericks said.",
      "White Calfe said the park is an opportunity \u201cto tell our own story, our own narrative from our own perspective in a place like this. That's pretty valuable.\u201d",

      "Sixty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led a rally protesting housing discrimination and segregated schools in Boston, thousands of people are expected to gather at the same site to honor and reflect on the historic event",
      "BOSTON -- As a Black teenager growing up in Boston, Wayne Lucas vividly remembers joining some 20,000 people to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak out against the city's segregated school system and the entrenched poverty in poor communities.",
      "Sixty years on, Lucas will be back on the Boston Common on Saturday to celebrate the anniversary of what became known as the 1965 Freedom Rally. This time, though, Lucas expects much of the focus will be on President Donald Trump and concerns that the commander-in-chief is exploiting divisions and fears about race and immigration.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s different forms of, how do we say it, racism and also I have to include fascism, what\u2019s going on in this country,\u201d said Lucas, a social activist and retired postal worker who was standing on the Boston Common near the site of 20-foot-high (6-meter) memorial to racial equity, \u201cThe Embrace,\u201d where the rally will be held.",
      "The rally will be preceded by a march mostly along the route taken to the Boston Common in 1965 and feature up to 125 different organizations.",
      "\u201cPeople gotta be aware and say something.\" he continued. \u201cWe can grumble (and) stuff like that, but we need to take part and do something.\"",
      "The original protest rally in 1965 brought the civil rights movement to the Northeast, a place King knew well from his time earning a doctorate in theology from Boston University and serving as assistant minister at the city\u2019s Twelfth Baptist Church. It was also the place he met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who earned a degree in music education from the New England Conservatory.",
      "In his speech, King told the crowd that he returned to Boston not to condemn the city but to encourage its leaders to do better at a time when Black leaders were fighting to desegregate the schools and housing and working to improve economic opportunities for Black residents. King also implored Boston to become a leader that other cities like New York and Chicago could follow in conducting \u201cthe creative experiments in the abolition of ghettos.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be demagogic and dishonest for me to say that Boston is a Birmingham, or to equate Massachusetts with Mississippi,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cBut it would be morally irresponsible were I to remain blind to the threat to liberty, the denial of opportunity, and the crippling poverty that we face in some sections of this community.\u201d",
      "The Boston rally happened after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and months ahead of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed in August.",
      "King and other civil rights movement leaders had just come off the Selma to Montgomery march in Alabama, also referred to as Blood Sunday, weeks before the Boston rally. The civil rights icon also was successful in the 1963 Birmingham campaign prompting the end of legalized racial segregation in the Alabama city, and eventually throughout the nation.",
      "This time in Boston, King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, will be the keynote speaker. He and other speakers are expected to touch on some of the same issues that have plagued communities of color for decades including the need for good jobs, decent health care and affordable housing.",
      "His visit also comes at a time when the Trump administration is waging war on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in government, schools and businesses around the country, including in Massachusetts.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges \u2014 public and private \u2014 that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.",
      "The Defense Department at one point temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown, in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing, had spoken publicly about his experiences as a Black man, and was only the second Black general to serve as chairman.",
      "The administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies\u2019 celebrations of Black History Month and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools. Trump also wants to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order targeting funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology.\"",
      "The efforts also impact Massachusetts. The state has pushed back against threats from the Trump administration to cut funding if the state doesn't comply with an Education Department order to certify local school systems' compliance with a race-neutral interpretation of civil rights laws.",
      "The Museum of African American History in Boston also announced earlier this month that a $500,000 federal grant received last year has been terminated.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, these efforts are designed to marginalize and destabilize the Museum of African American History, and African American public history institutions like us,\" the museum wrote in a statement. \u201cWe are all in danger of being erased.\u201d",
      "Martin Luther King III told The Associated Press that the attacks on diversity make little sense, noting, \u201cWe cannot move forward without understanding what happened in the past.\"",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s about blaming people. It\u2019s not about collective guilt. It\u2019s about collective responsibility,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow do we become better? Well, we appreciate everything that helped us to get to where we are. Diversity hasn't hurt the country.\u201d",
      "King said opponents of diversity have floated an uninformed narrative that unqualified people of color are taking jobs from white people, when the reality is they have long been denied opportunities they deserve.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if white people understand this, but Black people are tolerant,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom knee-high to a grasshopper, you have to be five times better than your white colleague. And that\u2019s how we prepare ourselves. So it\u2019s never a matter of unqualified, it\u2019s a matter of being excluded.\u201d",
      "Imari Paris Jeffries, the president and CEO of Embrace Boston, which along with the city is putting on the rally, said the event is a chance to remind people that elements of the \u201cpromissory note\u201d King referred to in his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech remain \"out of reach\u201d for many people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having a conversation about democracy. This is the promissory note \u2014 public education, public housing, public health, access to public art,\u201d Paris Jeffries said. \"All of these things are a part of democracy. Those are the things that are actually being threatened right now.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Coal-fired power plants, long a money-losing proposition in the U.S., are becoming more valuable now",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Coal-fired power plants, long an increasingly money-losing proposition in the U.S., are becoming more valuable now that the suddenly strong demand for electricity to run Big Tech's cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications has set off a full-on sprint to find new energy sources.",
      "President Donald Trump \u2014 who has pushed for U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market and suggested that coal can help meet surging power demand \u2014 is wielding his emergency authority to entice utilities to keep older coal-fired plants online and producing electricity.",
      "While some utilities were already delaying the retirement of coal-fired plants, the scores of coal-fired plants that have been shut down the past couple years \u2014 or will be shut down in the next couple years \u2014 are the object of growing interest from tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others competing for electricity.",
      "That\u2019s because they have a very attractive quality: high-voltage lines connecting to the electricity grid that they aren\u2019t using anymore and that a new power plant could use.",
      "That ready-to-go connection could enable a new generation of power plants \u2014 gas, nuclear, wind, solar or even battery storage \u2014 to help meet the demand for new power sources more quickly.",
      "For years, the bureaucratic nightmare around building new high-voltage power lines has ensnared efforts to get permits for such interconnections for new power plants, said John Jacobs, an energy policy analyst for the Washington, D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "\u201cThey are very interested in the potential here. Everyone sort of sees the writing on the wall for the need for transmission infrastructure, the need for clean firm power, the difficulty with siting projects and the value of reusing brownfield sites,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "Coincidentally, the pace of retirements of the nation's aging coal-fired plants had been projected to accelerate at a time when electricity demand is rising for the first time in decades.",
      "The Department of Energy, in a December report, said its strategy for meeting that demand includes re-using coal plants, which have been unable to compete with a flood of cheap natural gas while being burdened with tougher pollution regulations aimed at its comparatively heavy emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "There are federal incentives, as well \u2014 such as tax credits and loan guarantees \u2014 that encourage the redevelopment of retired coal-fired plants into new energy sources.",
      "Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power plant owners, said he expected Trump's executive orders will mean some coal-fired plants run longer than they would have \u2014 but that they are still destined for retirement.",
      "Time is of the essence in getting power plants online.",
      "Data center developers are reporting a yearlong wait in some areas to connect to the regional electricity grid. Rights-of-way approvals to build power lines can also be difficult to secure, given objections by neighbors who may not want to live near them.",
      "Stephen DeFrank, chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, said he believes rising energy demand has made retiring coal-fired plants far more valuable.",
      "That's especially true now that the operator of the congested mid-Atlantic power grid has re-configured its plans to favor sites like retired coal-fired plants as a shortcut to meet demand, DeFrank said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to make these properties more valuable because now, as long as I\u2019m shovel ready, these power plants have that connection already established, I can go in and convert it to whatever,\" DeFrank said.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the vast majority of conversions is likely to be natural gas because Pennsylvania sits atop the prolific Marcellus Shale reservoir, DeFrank said.",
      "In states across the South, utilities are replacing retiring or retired coal units with gas. That includes a plant owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority; a Duke Energy project in North Carolina; and a Georgia Power plant.",
      "The high-voltage lines at retired coal plants on the Atlantic Coast in New Jersey and Massachusetts were used to connect offshore wind turbines to electricity grids.",
      "In Alabama, the site of a coal-fired plant, Plant Gorgas, shuttered in 2019, will become home to Alabama Power\u2019s first utility-scale battery energy storage plant.",
      "Texas-based Vistra, meanwhile, is in the process of installing solar panels and energy storage plants at a fleet of retired and still-operating coal-fired plants it owns in Illinois, thanks in part to state subsidies approved there in 2021.",
      "Nuclear is also getting a hard look.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are advancing legislation to make it easier for three utilities there \u2014 Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Tucson Electric Power \u2014 to put advanced nuclear reactors on the sites of retiring coal-fired plants.",
      "At the behest of Indiana's governor, Purdue University studied how the state could attract a new nuclear power industry. In its November report, it estimated that reusing a coal-fired plant site for a new nuclear power plant could reduce project costs by between 7% and 26%.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, in a 2023 study before electricity demand began spiking, estimated that nuclear plants could cut costs from 15% to 35% by building at a retiring coal plant site, compared to building at a new site.",
      "Even building next to the coal plant could cut costs by 10% by utilizing transmission assets, roads and buildings while avoiding some permitting hurdles, the center said.",
      "That interconnection was a major driver for Terrapower when it chose to start construction in Wyoming on a next-generation nuclear power plant next to PacifiCorp\u2019s coal-fired Naughton Power Plant.",
      "Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the department analyzed how many sites might be suitable to advanced nuclear reactor plants.",
      "A compelling factor is the workers from coal plants who can be trained for work at a nuclear plant, Huff said. Those include electricians, welders and steam turbine maintenance technicians.",
      "In Homer City, the dread of losing its coal-fired plant \u2014 it shut down in 2023 after operating for 54 years \u2014 existed for years in the hills of western Pennsylvania\u2019s coal country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough 20 years here for our area, maybe even longer than that, with the closing of the mines, and this was the final nail, with the closing of the power plant,\u201d said Rob Nymick, Homer City's manager. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh my god, what do we do?\u2019\u201d",
      "That is changing.",
      "The plant's owners in recent weeks demolished the smoke stacks and cooling towers at the Homer City Generating State and announced a $10 billion plan for a natural gas-powered data center campus.",
      "It would be the nation\u2019s third-largest power generator and that has sown some optimism locally.",
      "\u201cMaybe we will get some families moving in, it would help the school district with their enrollment, it would help us with our population,\u201d Nymick said. \u201cWe\u2019re a dying town and hopefully maybe we can get a restaurant or two to open up and start thriving again. We\u2019re hoping.\u201d",

      "Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is asking his party\u2019s candidate vying to be Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor to step aside",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Republican John Reid said Friday he will continue his campaign to be Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor and denied he had anything to do with a social media account containing sexually explicit photos that had prompted GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin to call for him to quit the race.",
      "Reid, the first openly gay man to run statewide in Virginia and a supporter of Youngkin, posted a video response to the governor's attempt to stymie his candidacy after the governor learned of the photos on a Tumblr account with a username matching the candidate\u2019s Instagram handle. Reid said the account was a fabrication that comes as he grapples with increasing pressure to exit the race by members of his party.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s predictable, but what I didn\u2019t expect was the governor I have always supported to call and demand my resignation without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond,\u201d said Reid, a conservative talk-radio host. \u201cI did not accept that, and I deeply resent it.\u201d",
      "The political theater comes a week before the May 2 start of early voting in Virginia\u2019s primaries and only days after Reid's only Republican opponent dropped out.",
      "The Tumblr account, which was first reported by The Richmonder, was active Friday morning but was deleted by that afternoon. The webpage had reposted photos of naked men, according to The Richmonder.",
      "\u201cThe Governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content,\u201d according to a statement released by a political group affiliated with Youngkin. \u201cFriday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the Lt. Governor nominee.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Reid said he did not own the account. He also said his worst fear had been that someone would manufacture lies about him because of his sexuality.",
      "\u201cAnyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,\u201d he said.",
      "Reid became the sole Republican candidate after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity left the race because of his health.",

      "Before Youngkin's phone call, Reid said he was also pressed by a religious activist in Virginia to drop out after photos revealed him attending a drag show in Richmond. Since Herrity dropped out, Reid also said he received a deluge of requests insisting that he leave the race.",
      "Reid described the calls as \u201cdemands that I drop out, because supposedly, Christian voters would never support me, and it was inevitable that I would destroy the ticket and destroy Virginia,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI told everyone who called that I did not accept that analysis and would not decline the nomination that I\u2019ve worked for so many months to secure.\u201d",

The Tumblr account seemingly connected to Reid comes less than two years after Susanna Gibson, a Virginia Democrat, lost a House of Delegates race following reports that she had live-streamed sex acts with her husband on a pornographic website. Gibson has since said she and her husband did not consent to the live-stream being recorded, and argued the leak was criminal.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration is providing another example of how it's targeting those the president feels are blocking his agenda",
      "On Thursday, President Donald Trump directed his Department of Justice to investigate ActBlue, the Democratic Party-aligned fundraising site that has fueled so many successful challenges against his own party.",
      "The next day, amid a long-running feud with judges who have put some of his initiatives on hold because they may violate the Constitution, Trump's FBI arrested a Milwaukee judge, alleging she had helped a migrant evade immigration authorities.",
      "The two acts sent shockwaves through the legal and political worlds, which already have been reeling as Trump has used his office to target law firms, media outlets and individuals with whom he disagrees. The investigations are the latest version of a clear pattern in Trump's second term: The president has harnessed the power of the federal government to punish his enemies and anyone he sees as standing in his way.",
      "\u201cThis government has been consistent, from the moment it took office, in weaponizing the government and deploying it against critics,\u201d said Steve Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and the coauthor of \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201d \u201cThis is not a surprise. Trump campaigned on it and he's been doing it since day one.\u201d",
      "The complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday accused Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan of ushering the man, who is accused of being in the country illegally, out the \u201cjury door\u201d of her courtroom. The complaint alleges the judge became \u201cvisibly angry\u201d when told there were immigration agents in the courthouse.",
      "Her arrest Friday morning was announced in a post on X by Trump's FBI director, Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist who before the election had compiled an \u201cenemies list\u201d to target during the president's second term. Patel later deleted the post.",
      "Shortly after Dugan's arrest, a few dozen protesters marched outside the courthouse, chanting, \u201cJudge Dugan will be free, no justice, no peace.\u201d Democrats across the country were alarmed.",
      "\u201cThere are no kings in America,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. He called the arrest \u201ca dangerous escalation, an attack on the separation of powers, and we will fight this with everything we have.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on Fox News after the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a warning to judges across the country. She was addressing the case of Dugan and a retired New Mexico judge, whom the administration also is targeting for allegedly harboring someone in the country illegally. But her words carried extra weight given the administration's feuds with federal judges who have ruled against them in lawsuits challenging the administration's actions and executive orders.",
      "\"Some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not, and we\u2019re sending a very strong message today,\u201d Bondi said.",
      "Hours later, she revoked a Biden administration policy protecting journalists from having their records seized in leak investigations.",
      "Trump himself lambasted judges Friday as he flew to Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, frustrated that they were stalling his deportation plans.",
      "\u201cThese are judges who just want to show how big and important they are,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cThey shouldn't be allowed to do it. We have hundreds of thousands of people we want to get out of the country, and the courts are holding us back.\u201d",
      "The White House has mocked on social media an order, upheld unanimously at the U.S. Supreme Court, from a federal judge that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a Maryland man it admitted mistakenly deporting to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It mocked another federal judge who ordered planes full of immigrants turned around before they reached El Salvador. In another case, it acknowledged deporting additional migrants despite an order against it, arguing that the judge only forbade immigration authorities \u2014 and not the military \u2014 from removing the men from the country.",
      "Trump's allies in Congress and online have urged that judges be impeached if they have ruled against his other initiatives to cut the federal government or unilaterally change elections, or even to ignore orders outright. With the Republican-controlled Congress silent as Trump tries to remake the federal government, the courts have emerged as the only branch of government that is actively challenging the president.",
      "Trump also moved to kneecap one other force challenging him by targeting ActBlue. The website funnels small-dollar donations to predominantly Democratic candidates and has become a powerhouse in helping Democrats stay ahead of Republicans financially in many elections. The GOP set up a site to mimic it called WinRed, but Trump's order only directs a probe into the Democratic site, not the one run by his own party.",
      "Trump asked Bondi to see if ActBlue was a potential conduit for illegal overseas donations. The site said it followed the law, and it and Democrats condemned the probe as politically motivated.",
      "Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, said Trump's targeting of Democratic Party infrastructure fits a pattern of many authoritarians around the world, who use government power to cripple opposition parties so they can no longer win elections.",
      "\u201cWe're well past Watergate,\u201d he said, referring to the 1972 scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation two years later. \u201cThe investigation of ActBlue makes clear that we're not in a fully democratic country.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn a democracy,\u201d Nyhan said, \u201copposition parties don't have to fight uphill.\u201d",

    "summary": "BBC economics editor Faisal Islam on what comes next for the US president's central economic policy.",
    "story": [
      "Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed.",
      "The walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other.",
      "The former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "The latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground.",
      "At the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks.",
      "The concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as \"looters and pillagers\" of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around.",
      "The talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were \"highly disappointing\", hurting growth and destabilising markets.",
      "I was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss' government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets.",
      "The bugle of retreat",
      "In the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a \"beautiful rebalancing\" of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of \"looting and pillaging\".",
      "Yet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise.",
      "Most of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach.",
      "And there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.",
      "The collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.",
      "West Wing farce",
      "It is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.",
      "Financial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.",
      "The story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.",
      "Wall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.",
      "At best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.",
      "A nightmarish scenario",
      "And that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.",
      "At times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.",
      "But now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.",
      "Is it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.",
      "A little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.",
      "In this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.",
      "Some speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.",
      "No one crawling",
      "While Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026",
      "Another significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.",
      "\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.",
      "Consistent UK diplomacy",
      "This is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.",
      "I put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.",
      "But eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the National Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.",
      "That's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.",
      "A very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.",
      "There was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me.",
      "Bessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.",
      "A grand battle?",
      "But a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.",
      "He appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".",
      "Spain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.",
      "Whoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.",
      "There is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.",

    "summary": "There is greater competition among mortgage firms but no guarantee that rates will keep falling, brokers say.",
    "story": [
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit and a substantial fee.",
      "More frequent cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England are expected this year, amid global economic turmoil.",
      "However, lenders are already reflecting those predicted cuts in their latest deals, suggesting borrowers could be taking a risk by relying on ongoing drops in mortgage costs.",
      "\"If the base rate does come down then there is a chance fixes could get a bit cheaper but there are no guarantees,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "Timing issue for borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move closely in line with the Bank of England's base rate, which is expected to be cut from 4.5% on 8 May.",
      "However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "The average rate for a two-year fixed deal is now 5.21%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts. A typical five-year deal has a rate of 5.12%.",
      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "Low-deposit mortgage deals highest for 17 years",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "However, lenders are offering attention-grabbing sub-4% deals again to some customers. They were seen briefly in February, but market-watchers had not expected them to return for a while.",
      "The fallout from US tariffs policy has led the markets to settle on a view of more base rate cuts this year.",
      "As a result, so-called swap rates - a key measure on which mortgage deals are priced - have fallen.",
      "Equally, there is now little to tell between swap rates - and therefore mortgage rates - over two years and five years.",
      "\"More borrowers are taking two-year fixes on the assumption rates will reduce but many may be better off taking longer term fixes for the payment security,\" Mr Strutt said.",
      "Rachael Hunnisett believes that many people want to step away from \"the roulette wheel\" of short-term fixed-rate deals.",
      "\"There is a cohort who just do not want to take that level of risk with their home,\" she said, arguing that everyday payments, like children's activities, are affected if borrowers find themselves having to pay a higher rate after two years.",
      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",
      "Brokers say this is one example of a host of lenders competing by potentially allowing customers more flexibility to borrow larger amounts, particularly first-time buyers.",
      "They also point to the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, making changes earlier in the week that offered improved rates to those remortgaging - another sign of greater competition.",
      "David Hollingworth, from broker L&C, said that the sub-4% deals were now becoming part of the core range of mortgages offered by the big lenders.",
      "But he warned the global economic uncertainty meant these rates could quite quickly move either way.",
      "As a result, borrowers were increasingly applying for deals, almost as a backstop months before their old deals expired, he said. If rates improve before the new deal starts, then they could still switch to a better rate."

    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",
      "Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem's price cap.",
      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",
      "\"I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don't change it is frightening the life out of me.\"",
      "'I don't have the margin to invest in apprentices'",
      "'Perfect storm' could see end of salon apprenticeships",
      "'We're always hammered' - Beauty industry ahead of budget",
      "The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy.",
      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about \u00a37,000 to about \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",

    "summary": "Countries in the continent may see exports rise as both the US and China need new suppliers.",
    "story": [
      "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "Ten of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.",
      "Only Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.",
      "The exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.",
      "Commentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.",
      "While plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Global growth forecast slashed by IMF over tariff impact",
      "US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO",
      "US coffee shops worried about bitter price hike after tariffs",
      "Here I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.",
      "South America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.",
      "The US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.",
      "For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.",
      "There is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.",
      "With the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.",
      "These include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.",
      "He tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".",
      "However, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.",
      "So his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.",
      "\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Yet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.",
      "Take the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.",
      "Japan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.",
      "Other Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.",
      "Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.",
      "Trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.",
      "This would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place.",
      "The other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.",
      "Uruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.",
      "He said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.",
      "You may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.",
      "Whether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.",
      "Firstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.",
      "The US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.",
      "Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.",
      "Argentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.",
      "\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.",
      "Trump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.",
      "Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.",
      "Looking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.",
      "After all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.",
      "Mr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"",
      "He theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.",
      "So, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.",
      "As Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"",
      "Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.",
      "But adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"",

      "The UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably \"more important\" than the one it has with the US, the chancellor has told the BBC.",
      "Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US.",

      "\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been \"a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner\".",

      "She has said she wants to see \"free and fair\" trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology.",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would \"absolutely be seeking to prioritise\" a deal with the US over the EU.",
      "Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the \"next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US\".",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words.",
      "\"This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe.\"",
      "'We're all grappling with tariffs'",
      "Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she \"understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address\" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington.",
      "Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy.",
      "\"We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,\" she said.",
      "Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK.",
      "The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Reeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult.",
      "\"Obviously there are strains. We are all following what's happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Post Office has paid more than \u00a3600m of public money to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system despite deciding to ditch it more than a decade ago, the BBC can reveal.",
      "The terms of the original 1999 deal with computer giant Fujitsu mean the Post Office has been stuck with the system and unable to build a replacement so far, even after it contributed to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.",
      "Former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and other senior Labour government figures were warned about potential problems with the terms of the deal before it was signed, the BBC has learned.",
      "The Post Office said it \"apologises unreservedly to victims of the Horizon IT scandal\" and said it was committed to moving away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software.",
      "Under the terms of the original \u00a3548m deal, struck under pressure from the then-Labour government, the Post Office did not own the computer code for the core part of the Horizon system.",
      "Although the Post Office has wanted to switch suppliers since 2012, buying the rights to the code from Fujitsu or building a completely new system from scratch was considered too expensive - even as the amounts paid to Fujitsu to retain the Horizon system grew and grew.",
      "Because it did not own the code, the Post Office was also unable to inspect the part of the software that processed transactions, and had to rely on assurances from Fujitsu that it was functioning correctly.",
      "The Post Office, which is owned by the government, prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft, fraud and false accounting over supposed cash shortfalls in branches reported by the Horizon system, based on these assurances. The convictions were overturned by Parliament last year.",
      "Earlier this year, Business Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch told the House of Lords that the Post Office is \"unfortunately, still dependent on the Horizon system\", and the only way Fujitsu could be \"out of the picture\" immediately would mean shutting down all local post offices.",
      "An attempt to replace the system with one built by IBM failed in 2016, at a cost of \u00a340m, and the Post Office extended its contract with Fujitsu for at least four more years at a cost of \u00a3107m.",
      "The Post Office told the BBC that it finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software and code in 2023, although it is not known if this includes the core system that processes transactions.",
      "The \u00a310m price for the licence was \"cheap - because who else would buy it?\" according to IT expert Jason Coyne, one of the first people to identify flaws in the system.",
      "The BBC understands that the Post Office may try to use this licence for Horizon's replacement. But while this is being built,  IT experts believe the Post Office's contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond March 2026 - when it is currently due to end.",
      "Issues over who would own the Horizon software began when the contract to computerise the network of Post Office branches - then numbering 18,000 - was negotiated between the Post Office, Fujitsu and its subsidiary ICL Pathway, and the government.",
      "In May 1999, Sir Tony Blair received an update from the Treasury, in a document warning that discussions with ICL over the terms of a deal \"have foundered\".",
      "One of the sticking points was around intellectual property rights (IPR) - which included ownership of the code within the Horizon software.",
      "The document says that ICL was \"not prepared to... give perpetual licences for all the IPR\".",
      "It goes on to say that if the Post Office ever wanted to change suppliers, the owner of the IPR \"would be in a strong position to drive a costly settlement with the Post Office\".",
      "The BBC has also obtained a document from 20 May the same year, which was sent to then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and other government officials, warning about the issue of who owned the code.",
      "In it, a Treasury civil servant states that one of the \"main problems\" with the terms of a proposed deal with ICL for the Horizon software was the \"issues surrounding ownership of assets and IPR of the kit acquired by\" the Post Office.",
      "Mr Coyne, the IT expert, said it was \"utter madness\" that the deal went ahead in July 1999 because it meant that the Post Office became \"operationally reliant on Horizon\", even though it did not own the rights to use the system without Fujitsu.",
      "A spokesperson for Sir Tony Blair did not address the BBC's questions around his knowledge of the IPR issues but said he \"took very seriously the issues raised about the Horizon contract\" at the time.",
      "\"The final decision was taken after an investigation by an independent panel recommended it was viable.",
      "\"It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and Mr Blair has deep sympathy with all those affected.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said he \"would not have been shown the memo\" from 20 May 1999 and he would have been copied in as a \"formality\".",
      "\"He was not involved in any work related to the purchasing, award or management of the Horizon contract.\"",
      "The warnings about ownership of the IPR came true more than a decade later when Post Office decided to invite other companies to take over the Horizon contract.",
      "Former executives told the Post Office Inquiry, which is examining decisions leading up to the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters, how the company had found it difficult to replace Fujitsu.",
      "Alisdair Cameron, former chief financial officer at the Post Office, said that Fujitsu had been \"difficult colleagues\" and \"it was accepted that Horizon, and the infrastructure on which it was built, was vulnerable\".",
      "But Mike Young, chief operations officer at the Post Office between October 2010 and April 2012, told the inquiry that Fujitsu management said to him \"the code is ours. You own the service because you pay for that but you don't pay [for] the code\".",
      "Documents released by the Post Office Inquiry show the \"IPR issue\" was often discussed by top-level Post Office executives.",
      "\"There is a risk that we may be unable to agree an IP license with Fujitsu on reasonable terms\", said an agenda for a Post Office board meeting in July 2013 - while other documents describe concerns over costs.",
      "Procurement specialist Ian Makgill told us he believes not owning the IPR to the Horizon software would have been a factor in the collapse of the 2016 IBM deal to replace the system.",
      "He said that if IBM had tried to build new software without any of the IPR from Horizon, it would have needed to \"start from scratch, which would have cost the Post Office hundreds of millions of pounds\".",
      "\"IPR is the reason why the Post Office hasn't been able to move away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software,\" he said.",
      "Since 1999, the Post Office has spent \u00a32.5bn on contracts with Fujitsu. This figure includes more than \u00a3600m spent on bridging or extension contracts to continue the Horizon contract since the Post Office started looking for new suppliers in 2012, according to analysis from data firm Tussell and the BBC.",
      "Many of the sub-postmasters wrongly accused by the Post Office maintained that there was no missing money and the shortfalls were down to errors in the Horizon system.",
      "But with the Post Office unable to directly inspect the system which processed transactions, it accepted assurances from Fujitsu that the system was working correctly.",
      "\"Fujitsu were fighting the whole time to protect their investment and their intellectual property, rather than looking after the interests of the sub-postmasters,\" said Mr Makgill.",
      "Fujitsu did not respond to the BBC's specific questions but stated that it was \"focused on supporting the Post Office in their plans for a new service delivery model\" so branches can continue to operate.",
      "Mr Makgill said that the Post Office bears the \"ultimate responsibility\" over the fate of wrongly accused sub-postmasters.",
      "\"They didn't have to take those prosecutions, they didn't have to take people to court.\"",
      "Sub-postmasters currently using the Horizon IT software continue to report issues with it. Seven in 10 said they had experienced an \"unexplained discrepancy\" on the system since January 2020, according to a YouGov survey with 1,015 respondents commissioned by the Post Office Inquiry in 2024.",
      "The Post Office has said that it has not undertaken any prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and \"has no intention of doing so\".",
      "It told the BBC that it is \"implementing changes across the entire organisation\" so that it is \"fit for the future, fundamentally changed and with postmasters at its heart\".",
      "It said this includes working with Fujitsu to correct discrepancies and reviewing the current version of Horizon - replacing it in stages, under a five-year plan named the \"Future Technology Portfolio\".",
      "Post Office chairman Nigel Railton has said a new IT system would not be introduced in one \"big bang\" but there would be gradual changes.",
      "The Post Office did not respond to the BBC's specific questions about IPR being the reason why the company was unable to ditch Fujitsu, and said it would not be appropriate to comment ahead of the Post Office Inquiry's final report.",
      "The Department of Business and Trade told the BBC that it was providing \u00a3136m of funding over the next five years to the Future Technology Portfolio, and was \"working at pace\" to ensure the Post Office had the technology it needed, including replacing the Horizon system.",

      "Some retailers have argued that they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and prices for customers.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.",
      "The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen sales soar.",
      "It has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had a devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".",

      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",

      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,\" he said.",
      "The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.",
      "US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.",
      "These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.",
      "Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a \"matter of impetus and will\".",
      "\"There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.",
      "\"If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy\u2026 if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.\"",
      "The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected a de-escalation of the trade war and that the current situation was \"not a joke\".",
      "Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.",
      "Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.",
      "Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as \"climate change, gender and social issue\".",
      "\"These issues are not the IMF's mission,\" he said.",
      "Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.",
      "Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was \"very frankly encouraged\" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.",
      "Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are \"falling short\" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.",
      "He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and \"push them to accomplish their important mandates\"."

      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",

      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",

      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",

      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",

    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:04:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",

      "All her jewellery had been taken for a sum of about $10m (\u00a37.5m) \u2013 including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m).",

      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",

      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",

      "He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\"",
      "Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him.",
      "One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef.",
      "Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\".",
      "But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\"",
      "Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time.",
      "Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\"",
      "'Absolutely not true'",
      "Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021.",
      "Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\".",
      "He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis.",
      "He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place.",
      "He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\"",
      "But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\".",
      "He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef.",
      "Torode has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\".",
      "\"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\"",
      "He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him.",
      "Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\"",
      "He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment.",
      "\"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\"",
      "\"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\"",
      "Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades.",
      "BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022.",
      "Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers.",
      "Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.",
      "BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked.",
      "Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set.",
      "After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims.",
      "One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show.",
      "His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.",
      "If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line."

      "The culture secretary has said the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and insisted \"no options are off the table\" when the government begins a review into the corporation's current funding model later this year.",
      "In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Lisa Nandy said there were \"problems\" with the annual charge, with \"fewer and fewer people\" paying the \u00a3174.50 fee.",
      "The charter, which expires in 2027 and is under review, is an agreement between the BBC and the government that sets out the terms and purposes of the corporation - including the existence of the licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster looks forward to engaging with the government and securing the long-term future of the BBC.",
      "Nandy has already started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding.",
      "It currently gets most of its income from the licence fee - in the last financial year, the BBC received \u00a33.7bn, or about two-thirds of its total income, from it.",
      "\"We're open to a different system,\" she told the Telegraph, but admitted no preferred options had been put forward yet.",
      "She added the government wanted the public's input in shaping the new model to create \"a fairer, more sustainable system\".",
      "According to the BBC, 80% of households currently pay the licence fee.",
      "Nandy said: \"We recognise there are problems with the licence fee. Fewer and fewer people are paying it.",
      "\"It's unenforceable and, particularly, I've been very concerned about the way it's been enforced in the past, with women - particularly vulnerable women - targeted for enforcement action, and the BBC itself has accepted that.\"",
      "Two BBC reviews found the gender disparity had been due to societal factors.",
      "The review in 2017 detailed a gender skew towards women-only households, a greater likelihood of women answering the door to TV Licensing Enquiry Officers and a higher chance of them engaging positively with an officer.",
      "In 2023, the BBC set out plans to reduce the high proportion of women being prosecuted for licence fee evasion, after figures showed that they made up 76% of the 52,376 people convicted over it in 2020.",
      "Nandy has previously said the charge was \"deeply regressive\" and that she was thinking \"quite radically and creatively\" about alternatives. But the minister has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC.",
      "She did, however, keep open the possibility of a subscription model.",
      "Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation's chairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The public cares about the BBC and we have launched our biggest ever public engagement exercise, so audiences can help drive and shape what they want from a universal and independent BBC in the future.",

      "Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.",
      "On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.",
      "But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.",
      "And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.",
      "Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.",
      "\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"",
      "The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.",
      "\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.",

      "\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"",
      "Warming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.",
      "\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"",
      "To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.",
      "Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.",
      "\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.",
      "\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"",
      "'Sexiness and liberation'",
      "One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".",

      "\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.",
      "\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"",
      "Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.",

    "summary": "The McFly star says he is \"so lucky and honoured\" to have written the music and lyrics for the new show.",
    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",
      "\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\"",

      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

    "story": [
      "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.",
      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",
      "His voice tails off, full of emotion.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die.\"",
      "Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.",
      "\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.",
      "But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".",
      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",

    "story": [
      "Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.",
      "The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals.",
      "It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents.",
      "In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.",
      "In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed.",
      "In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures.",
      "The hospital investigation found fatigue was \"likely to have been a factor\".",
      "Sleep-deprived",
      "Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis.",
      "And one doctor told the watchdog: \"When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?\"",
      "The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.",
      "Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue.",
      "The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue.",
      "It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.",
      "Support available",
      "Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: \"Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.",
      "\"We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.\"",
      "Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite.",
      "She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.",
      "But she said fatigue was also \"often driven by workforce shortages\" too.",
      "A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was \"committed\" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care.",
      "\"Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,\" he added.",
      "He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.",

      "But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago.",
      "\"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\"",
      "Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media.",
      "Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.",
      "Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.",
      "While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing.",
      "For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.",

      "After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation.",
      "These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal.",
      "As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched.",
      "Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's \"magic mirror\" feature, the app still points out \"imperfections\" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries.",

      "Abby seems amused.",
      "\"Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?\"",

      "Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing.",
      "\"I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,\" Dr Yang says.",
      "\"Some even had surgery inside people's homes.\"",
      "Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong.",

      "Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse.",
      "One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose.",

      "\"They wanted me to leave from the beginning,\" she says.",
      "Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months.",

      "The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops.",
      "If you get a normal vape, he says, \"they've got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes\".",
      "But if you get an illegal one, \"it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that'll have on someone's lungs.\"",
      "According to Trading Standards, illicit or non-compliant vapes can be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings.",
      "The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown.",
      "On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter.",
      "\"It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it's just a case of where they're hiding the rest,\" says Paul.",
      "We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes.",
      "Paul's hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes.",
      "How widespread are illegal vapes?",
      "Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024:",
      "At least 6,169,822 illicit or non-compliant vaping products were seized, including those taken at ports as well as in shopsThere were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than onceRetailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",

      "Retailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",
      "Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once.",
      "The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular 'cash market', that we've seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes.\"",
      "They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said it was allocating an extra \u00a310m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded.",
      "Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation.",
      "\"These are quite sophisticated networks that we're up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,\" says Paul.",
      "\"I think we'll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven't really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time.",
      "\"They've always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here.\"",
      "When does the disposable vapes ban start?",
      "From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale.",
      "Those caught doing so will get a \u00a3200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences.",
      "The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement.",
      "Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting \"not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced\" and \"some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to\".",
      "But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was \"definitely having an impact\".",
      "Government funding had enabled \"extra boots on the ground\" at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points \u2013 Hillingdon and Kent.",
      "In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total.",
      "They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning \"seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective\".",
      "However, they said there was still a \"huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children\".",
      "Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally.",
      "He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is \"easily in the millions at the moment\", adding: \"It's a constant battle trying to make a difference.\"",

      "Warning: This story contains an image of surgery",

      "Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before.",
      "\"I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,\" he says. \"But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life.\"",

      "A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition.",
      "Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival.",

      "Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs.",

      "Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope's ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart.",
      "Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says.",

      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the \"logical consequence\" of the Supreme Court ruling and EHRC guidance was that \"people use the facilities of their biological sex\".",
      "Asked if the government would ban trans people from using changing rooms or toilets they wish to use in its own buildings, he told the BBC: \"In reality, when you say ban, am I going to be standing outside toilets?  I'm probably not.",
      "\"There isn't going to be toilet police but that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.\"",
      "The UK government has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, saying it brings \"clarity\" for women and service providers.",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\"",
      "Last week the Supreme Court found the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "As part of the judgement in the case brought against Scottish ministers by the group For Women Scotland, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",

      "Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the interim guidance, which was published on Friday following the Supreme Court ruling on 15 April, was \"rushed and ill-thought out\".",
      "\"It's been really obvious that they have not listened to trans people,\" she told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.",
      "She added that the guidance put trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces, and \"seems to fly in face of the strong tradition of tolerance we have in Britain\".",
      "The Green Party said in a statement that the guidance was likely to cause \"distress\" to the trans community as well as \"further confusion to employers, businesses and service providers\" .",
      "It is calling for the guidance to be withdrawn \"until the EHRC can produce something more thought-through which takes into account the voices of all those affected\".",
      "Denyer questioned what should happen if trans people are not allowed to go to the toilet of their gender or their birth sex.",
      "The guidance also states that in some circumstances the law allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use women's facilities.",
      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",
      "However, the guidance says where possible mixed-sex toilets or changing facilities should be provided, with lockable rooms intended to be used by one person at a time, in addition to single-sex facilities.",
      "Denyer also raised concerns that for lesbian associations or venues which wanted to include trans women, the advice appeared to say they would not be allowed to.",
      "The guidance states that \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men)\", while \"a men-only or gay men-only associations should not admit trans men (biological women)\".",
      "Sir Ed also told the programme lots of people were confused and anxious about the guidance, for example over which toilet a trans man (biological woman) should use.",
      "The Lib Dem leader said his party accepted the Supreme Court ruling but there needed to be more debate in Parliament to reach a clear solution that \"respects people's rights\".",
      "The EHRC, which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses, is expected to launch a two-week consultation to seek views from those affected in May.",
      "The watchdog is then aiming to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June.",
      "A spokesperson for the EHRC said: \"The law is as set out in the Supreme Court's very readable judgment and is effective immediately.",
      "\"Employers, service providers and others with duties under the Equality Act must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary.",
      "\"But we know many people have questions about the consequences of the judgment and what it means for them, which is why we issued this [guidance] in the interim.\"",
      "The spokesperson added: \"We remain committed to promoting equality and tackling discrimination in all its forms.\"",

      "The attention thrust on the Cheshire constituency of Runcorn and Helsby is a sign of the high stakes in this by-election, which was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP Mike Amesbury.",
      "He was handed a 10-week prison term after punching a constituent in Frodsham, Cheshire. It was reduced to a suspended sentence after an appeal.",
      "The constituency combines the industrial town of Runcorn, sitting on the banks of the River Mersey, with a more rural area stretching south towards Chester.",
      "It's a relatively new seat, formed by boundary changes ahead of last year's general election, but Labour still won comfortably in an area that's considered one of the party's strongholds in the North West of England.",
      "But Reform UK placed second in 2024 \u2013 and now they have the constituency firmly in their sights as they try to show their momentum isn't limited to opinion polls.",

      "Both national and local issues have come up in this campaign, from tolls on local bridges and the regeneration of the high street to health, housing, the cost of living and immigration \u2013 with a lot of focus on a local hotel that's been used to house asylum seekers.",
      "Anthony Stonebanks, who runs a caf\u00e9 and events space at the Heath Business Park, cites illegal immigration as one of the issues on his mind - along with facilities for young people and a lack of funding in the area.",

      "It's a familiar refrain from those who feel elections can bring attention and promises, without always yielding results.",
      "Outside the town of Runcorn, the constituency becomes more rural, and the political landscape changes too.",
      "Before the seat was reconfigured, some of the villages sat in areas held by the Conservatives before 2017 and the party's fighting this by-election with the hope of showing it can still command support.",

      "\"I think British politics feels broken at the moment and everyone's sort of pulling in from big political parties and saying a lot of lip service, and I really don't think a big political party can get to grips with local issues,\" he says.",
      "There are a total of 15 candidates vying for votes in Runcorn and Helsby on 1 May, with representatives from the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party among them.",
      "When the results roll in, it won't just have an impact on the people who live in the area.",
      "This is the first parliamentary by-election since Keir Starmer took power, and in a seat that had been considered safe for Labour the result will be an important measure of the party's support after less than a year in government.",

      "The BBC emailed Bridgwood for a response last week but has not received a reply.",

      "In 2024, Reform UK dropped a number of candidates it had selected for the general election over offensive comments on social media.",
      "Following that, Farage told the BBC \"I had no idea how bad it was. I had no idea that half of these people simply haven't been vetted - that's got to change.\"",

    "story": [
      "The amount of cannabis posted to the UK from Thailand has dropped by 90% in three months thanks to cooperation with Thai Customs, the Home Office has said.",
      "When Thailand decriminalised cannabis in 2022, a surge of illegal shipments  threatened to overwhelm UK Border Force - which uncovered 15 tonnes of the drug in the post in the final quarter of last year.",
      "But a new deal requiring parcels from Thailand to be checked before they are shipped meant just three months later the figure had dropped to 1.5 tonnes.",
      "Border Minister Seema Malhotra hailed the deal as a \"prime example\" of international cooperation helping Labour's mission for \"safer streets\".",

      "The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to \"reset\" relations after Brexit.",
      "Labour has previously said it has \"no plans\" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.",
      "But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a \"running commentary\" on talks.",
      "It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a \"new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30\".",
      "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
      "EU chief 'surprised' at fish status in Brexit talks",
      "In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would \"extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.",
      "Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made.",
      "\"They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month.\"",
      "The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.",
      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",

      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about \u00a37,000 to about \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",

      "The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven't encountered thus far - a track record to defend.",
      "The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour's wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10.",
      "Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to \"have to be unpopular\" \u2013 a curious ambition for a politician!",
      "But more candid insiders admit the government \"looked very unsure\" at the start. \"They didn't come in with a big project,\" one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers' freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance.",

      "A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won't be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, \"they're just not our heartlands, so we just haven't got our normal base\".",
      "But Labour could also lose mayors and there's no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on.",
      "After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt.",
      "The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it's going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, \"absolutely, mercilessly hammered\" back in July.",
      "The leadership says \"nowhere is safe\".  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control.",
      "The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that \"we might not yet actually have hit the bottom\", in the words of another veteran.",
      "Leader Kemi Badenoch's backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years.",
      "The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won't usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a Conservative who'd happily bet their mortgage she'll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election.",
      "That's in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, \"she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it's not her versus Starmer,  it's her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey\".",
      "This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. They see success in these elections as \"two or three more steps up the staircase\" towards power, says a senior figure.",
      "The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and \"putting Farage out to draw a crowd\", according to a minister.",

The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week \u2013 whether it's Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West.",
      "Leader Sir Ed Davey's been back in his happy place \u2013 carrying out ever more ridiculous stunts on the campaign trail, meeting hedgehogs, and even waving around packets of British pork chops on TikTok this time, (I'm not making that up).",
      "After July last year, the Lib Dems have a taste for making the Tories miserable, not just for the sake of it, but in the hope of taking out another chunk of their party's traditional infrastructure, in the shape of their county councillors.",
      "And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England.",
      "In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year.",
      "This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats.",
      "The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force.",
      "Any election is also a test of our political parties' campaign machines \u2013 the questions different for each this time round.",
      "For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn't seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn't surprise.",
      "For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the \"tumbleweed Tories\", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground.",
      "Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country.",
      "The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online.",
      "In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that \"sliver here and sliver there\".",
      "These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's \"fragmentation\" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead.",
      "The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority.",
      "In that case, they go into what's known as \"no overall control\", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way.",
      "It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground?",
      "Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement.",
      "Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, \"the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend\".",
      "Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the \"ABC election \u2013 Anyone But the Conservatives\", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the \"ABB election \u2013 Anyone But the Big parties\".",

    "summary": "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and April created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread.",
    "story": [
      "The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests.",
      "More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.",
      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",
      "The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.",
      "In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.",
      "A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.",
      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",
      "\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.",

      "\"On the plus side, better weather is more inviting for us to get out and enjoy the spring. Dawn chorus is at its peak at the minute and calm, warm mornings are perfect for enjoying it,\" says Jon Carter of the BTO.",
      "The Met Office says a brief spell of warmth at the end of April isn't a bad thing for wildlife - and there shouldn't be much impact to water sources such as ponds.",
      "\"Climate change is already having a big impact on our wildlife, but a temporary blip like this is an end of April dividend for wildlife,\" says the Met Office's Grahame Madge.",
      "Some wildlife accelerates its activity with warm spring weather, so people may see natural areas near them teaming with life this coming week.",
      "Butterflies and birds may be particularly prominent, Mr Madge adds.",
      "Some studies suggest warm weather means birds can breed earlier in the year and do not need to incubate their young for as long.",
      "Migratory birds - such as swallows and swifts - that return to the UK because there are more insects to feed on in warmer climes, may be coming back sooner. The Met Office says a swallow was reported in southern England before March this year.",
      "Warm weather can also see butterflies emerge. Hotter days earlier in the year can bring out red admirals, previously an exclusively migratory insect.",
      "The peacock and small tortoiseshell are among the first to spread their wings, with more butterflies emerging from April onwards.",
      "Dragonflies start to be seen around this time, too.",
      "There could also be some sightings of rare visitors such as the exotic European bee-eater, which have recently begun nesting in the UK.",
      "Wildlife charities say it's a great time to get out and about and enjoy nature, but people should be on their guard against accidentally starting a fire.",
      "Oliver Fry of Surrey Wildlife Trust says conditions are incredibly dry on the heathlands of Surrey, which creates \"tinderbox conditions\".",
      "The wild, flat landscapes dotted with gorse and heather are known for their wildlife, including rare species like the sand lizard, woodlark and silver-studded blue butterfly.",
      "Earlier this month, conservationists warned that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires.",
      "Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring.",
      "\"It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,\" she says. \"This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife \u2013 with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.\"",
      "On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores \u2013 and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor.",
      "\"Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,\" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.",
      "Heatwaves and increases in sea temperatures can cause some whales to roam far from their usual areas just to survive, he adds.",

      "Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order aimed at stepping up deep-sea mining within US and in international waters.",
      "The move to allow exploration outside its national waters has been met by condemnation from China which said it \"violates\" international law.",
      "Thursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors.",

      "Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain",
      "The latest US executive order was issued to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\", it reads.",
      "The move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters.",
      "Many countries, including China, have delayed issuing permits until countries agreed a framework for how resources could be shared.",
      "\"The US authorisation... violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday.",
      "China dominates global production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium.",
      "Trump has been frustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say.",
      "\"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a US official said on Thursday.",
      "To achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in \"areas beyond national jurisdiction\".",
      "The administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (\u00a3225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs",
      "The EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out.",
      "Environmentalists and scientists are concerned that marine species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process.",
      "\"Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean,\" said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xz664r2do",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",

    "summary": "The industry says powers to self-monitor water quality should be handed back to the regulator.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies should no longer be allowed to monitor their own levels of sewage pollution, the industry body has told the BBC exclusively.",
      "Instead they are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to build consumer trust.",
      "The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.",
      "Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.",
      "A third-party system could add more pressure to the regulators, which have also been criticised for not holding the companies to account.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "England water pollution at 10-year high, campaigners say",
      "Government has broken the law on sewage, says watchdog",
      "A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.",
      "David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: \"We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.\"",
      "As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as \"operator self monitoring\".",
      "But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.",
      "Southern Water was previously issued fines totalling \u00a3213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.",
      "In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites which caused \"major environmental harm\" to wildlife.",
      "The company later admitted its actions \"fell short\".",
      "Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to \"reduce the administrative burden\" on the Environment Agency (EA).",
      "In 2023, the BBC reported that EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.",
      "The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system, calling it the equivalent of companies \"mark[ing] their own homework\".",
      "But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.",
      "\"Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,\" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.",
      "It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.",
      "A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.\"",
      "The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.",
      "Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.",
      "The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.",
      "\"The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,\" said Henderson.",
      "\"This doesn't properly reflect the value of water and encourage people to conserve it in the way that we need,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Experts say the discovery provides the first physical evidence of gladiatorial combat with animals.",
    "story": [
      "Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.",
      "The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.",
      "Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.",
      "Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats.",
      "\"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said.",
      "\"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\"",
      "Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.",
      "Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.",
      "\"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\"",
      "As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.",
      "\"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News.",
      "The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.",
      "The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\"",
      "The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.",
      "Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.",
      "Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\".",
      "Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".",
      "His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.",
      "Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\"",
      "The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.",
      "Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.",
      "The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.",
      "David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\""

    "summary": "The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut.",
    "story": [
      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",
      "\"So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",

    "summary": "The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.",
    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",
      "\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.",
      "Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.",
      "\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.",
      "The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.",

    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

    "summary": "Skeletons and artefacts unearthed from the site near Cardiff Airport are baffling archaeologists.",
    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",
      "But for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.",

      "Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.",
      "The migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit on Sunday night.",
      "Despite the humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, most of them intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work.",
      "Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the International Organization of Migration (IOM).",
      "In 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive.",
      "Earlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "Centcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".",
      "Who are the Houthis and why is the US targeting them?",
      "Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He has also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.",
      "On Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".",
      "Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.",
      "The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.",
      "The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.",
      "Over the last decade, Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.",
      "The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid."

    "summary": "The US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.",
    "story": [
      "Canadians will cast their ballots on Monday in a pivotal election that has been completely transformed by US President Donald Trump.",
      "The Conservatives appeared certain to win any contest by a landslide at the start of the year, until Trump's tariffs and barbs about making Canada the \"51st state\" upended the country's politics and injected fresh life into Mark Carney's Liberal Party.",
      "The final polls suggest the Liberals are slightly ahead, although the race has tightened in the past week and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says his party can win.",
      "The 36-day campaign ended on a sombre note as party leaders responded to the Saturday evening car ramming that killed 11 people in Vancouver.",
      "Community in shock after Vancouver car ramming attack What we know about the Vancouver car ramming attack",
      "Community in shock after Vancouver car ramming attack",
      "What we know about the Vancouver car ramming attack",
      "Carney, the incumbent prime minister, cancelled a stop in Hamilton on Sunday morning to address the nation following the attack, which saw an SUV ram into a crowd gathered for a local Filipino festival.",
      "Poilievre, meanwhile, added a campaign stop in Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, to speak with members of the Filipino community there.",
      "Later in the day, Carney held a spree of events in three provinces - Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia - in a final push to get out the vote in western Canada, where the Conservatives have more support.",
      "Trump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on America's northern neighbour and his repeated threats to annex the country as the \"51st state\" fanned deep anger as well as feelings of Canadian nationalism. It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken.",
      "The US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House.",
      "During campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was \"trying to break us so the US can own us\".",
      "He positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit.",
      "At a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other \"reliable trade partners\" like the UK and the European Union. Earlier in the election, he said the old relationship that Canada had enjoyed with the US for decades was \"over\".",

      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre made his final stops in Ontario where polls indicate his party is trailing behind. The populous province is home to 122 seats in Parliament out of 343 that could alter the outcome of the election. A party must win 172 seats to have a majority government. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons.",
      "Much of Poilievre's messaging has centred on what he has called the \"lost Liberal decade\" under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls.",
      "The Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need.",
      "\"We need to vote for change so you can afford food and homes,\" he told supporters at a campaign stop in Peterborough, a city north-east of Toronto.",
      "And with the election shaping up as a race between the Conservatives and the Liberals, smaller parties have struggled to gain traction.",
      "The left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, faces the prospect of losing a number of seats as it trails behind the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which runs candidates only in the French-speaking province of Quebec.",
      "Singh cancelled a number of campaign events on Sunday in light of the deadly attack in Vancouver. The NDP leader, who is running for re-election in a Vancouver-area riding, was meeting supporters at the Lapu Lapu festival minutes before the attack. He appeared visibly emotional when he spoke to the media afterwards.",
      "Throughout the election, Singh called on Canadians to vote for his party's candidates so they can act as a check on power in Ottawa.",
      "The Bloc has also struggled, with fears over Trump's threats and Canada's future fuelling anxiety throughout the country and pushing voters towards the bigger federal parties.",
      "Historically, Canada has only been led by Liberal or Conservative governments.",
      "While President Trump has been a central figure to Canada's election, he has steered clear of commenting on its outcome.",
      "But the Trump administration has continued its rhetoric on taking over Canada. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that \"the president has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state\".",
      "Polls will open at 08:30 local time on Monday in Newfoundland and Labrador (12:00 GMT). The election will span across six time zones, with the last polls closing in British Columbia at 19:00 PST (03:00 GMT on Tuesday).",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 19:26:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery had been taken for a sum of about $10m (\u00a37.5m) \u2013 including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m).",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

      "In Iran, mourning is turning to anger after a huge blast at its largest commercial port killed at least 40 people and injured more than 1,000.",
      "The explosion happened on Saturday morning at Shahid Rajaee port. Many people rushed to hospitals up and down the country to give blood.",
      "A day later, fires are still blazing as a thick black cloud of toxic chemicals hangs over the surrounding area.",
      "People in nearby towns and cities have been told by the health ministry to stay indoors \"until further notice\" and wear more protective clothes.",
      "In the nearby southern city of Bandar Abbas, home to the Iranian Navy's main base, all schools and offices were ordered to shut on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said.",
      "A local festival not far from Shahid Rajee Port that was supposed to be a celebration spontaneously turned into a solemn occasion for remembering the dead and praying for the injured.",
      "Authorities declared a day of national mourning on Monday, with an additional two days of mourning in Hormozgan province.",
      "It is a reminder that while Iran has been rocked physically by the blast - residents up to 50km (31 miles) away reported feeling the effects - the country is now being rocked by a growing blame game too.",
      "Ambrey Intelligence, a private maritime risk consultancy, said it believed that intense fires that could be seen spreading between containers before the explosion were a result of \"improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles\".",
      "The firm said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles, and was aware that an Iran-flagged ship \"discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025\".",
      "The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate - a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.",

      "Many in Iran are blaming the authorities for incompetence and worse, asking: How could so much inflammable material apparently be left on the port without due care?",
      "That is a question that the Iranian regime will need to address. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited the scene of the explosion on Sunday, saying: \"We have come to see first-hand if there is anything or any issue that the government can follow up on.\"",

      "Defence ministry spokesman Reza Talaei-Nik later told state TV that \"there has been no imported or exported cargo for military fuel or military use in the area\".",
      "The port's customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials' storage depot.",
      "There is also the question of whether Iran's economy may be affected, given the port handles nearly 80% of the country's imports.",
      "On Saturday, authorities were warning of possible food shortages in the near term with the port out of action for some time.",
      "A day later, they were playing that down, saying that the explosion only affected a part of the port and that the rest is functioning normally.",

      "Others showed firefighters working among toppled and blackened cargo containers, and carrying out the body of a victim. The authorities have closed off roads leading to the site.",
      "The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered that multiple specialist firefighting aircraft be sent to Iran to help deal with the aftermath of the disaster.",

      "It follows his meeting with the head of Israel's spy agency on Thursday.",
      "Speaking in Doha, Turkey's foreign minister Hakan Fidan said that Hamas appeared to be more receptive to negotiating a lasting solution to the war.",

      "As heads of state and foreign dignitaries took their places to the right of the altar, hundreds of photographers in the press area on the roof of the colonnade snapped their cameras furiously, hoping to capture a candid image of US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose last meeting in February gave rise to a combative exchange in the Oval Office.",
      "But soon after, as a striking photo of the two men sitting on two chairs inside St Peter's began to circulate, it emerged that they had already met for around 15 minutes before the service began.",

      "Yet the voice of 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re rang loud and clear as he presided over the mass.",
      "The service's structure was very similar to that of any Catholic funeral mass, although the readings were done in many different languages and all hymns were sung in Latin.",
      "Outside St Peter's, a crowd the Vatican later said numbered 200,000 applauded as large screens showed Zelensky take his seat. There was also applause when the Pope's simple wooden coffin was brought out.",
      "The crowd's applause marked some other salient moments - such as when Cardinal Re, as part of his homily, remembered the Pope's commitment to migrants and peace.",
      "He mentioned that the Pope's first trip had been to the Italian island of Lampedusa, the port of arrival in Europe for many migrants who make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, and recalled the mass the Pope celebrated at the US-Mexico border.",
      "\"War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.\"",

      "\"It was good to hear that on a day when so many heads of state were on St Peter's Square,\" a woman called Maria told the BBC. She and her friend Grazia had flown in from Sardinia especially for the funeral.",
      "\"It was a message especially for them, I think, because it's them who decide whether there's going to be war or peace, not us... Let's hope something made it through to them.\"",
      "\"Otherwise them being here was just pure hypocrisy,\" added Grazia.",
      "During communion, a procession of white-clad priests made its way down St Peter's Square, carrying golden chalices full of wafers for communion, as many in the large crowd moved forward to receive the hosts.",
      "Soon after, Cardinal Re blessed the Pope's coffin with holy water, before burning incense in a thurible - a symbol of cleansing - and the basilica's bells tolled three times after the blessing of the coffin was carried out.",
      "After some brief mingling, world leaders started making their way out of the basilica. Their motorcades then filed out of the Vatican.",
      "Within an hour Trump was reported to be back on Air Force One, while other leaders held various informal meetings in Rome.",
      "Meanwhile, the Pope's coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore for burial.",
      "Authorities said 140,000 had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse \u2013 a repurposed white popemobile \u2013 crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia.",
      "Once the coffin reached Santa Maria Maggiore, it was taken inside and the live broadcast ceased.",
      "Pope Francis was buried in the righthand side of the church, near a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary, at around 15:00.",
      "Visitors, pilgrims and the clergy vacated St Peter's Square quickly. Many could be seen minutes later in the numerous cafes, restaurants and pizzerias of the historic Borgo Pio neighbourhood nearby.",
      "Grazia from Sardinia said the funeral had made a big impression on her.",
      "\"It was wonderful to meet in a single square with people who come from every corner of the world and to live a shared moment. This is the legacy of the Pope,\" she said.",
      "Officials said the day had unfolded without any major incidents.",

      "With 135 cardinals set to attend, it will be the largest conclave in modern history and one of the most unpredictable.",
      "Over the past few days, cardinals wandering around Rome were hounded by journalists trying to get a steer on what the conclave might yield.",
      "After the funeral, too, the Cardinal of Tonga Soane Patita Paini Mafi was approached by the media as he made his way out of St Peter's Square.",
      "After a South American pope, is it time for an Asian one, he was asked.",
      "Cardinal Mafi laughed and pointed to the sky. \"Only He knows,\" he said."

    "summary": "After a campaign upended by Trump\u2019s threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.",
    "story": [
      "At a rally in London, Ontario, on Friday, the crowd booed as Mark Carney delivered his core campaign line about the existential threat Canada faces from its neighbour.",
      "\"President Trump is trying to break us so that America could own us,\" the Liberal leader warned.",
      "\"Never,\" supporters shouted back. Many waved Canadian flags taped to ice hockey sticks.",
      "Similar levels of passion were also on display at the union hall where Pierre Poilievre greeted enthusiastic supporters in the Toronto area earlier in the week.",
      "The Conservative leader has drawn large crowds to rallies across the country, where \"Bring it Home\" is a call to arms: both to vote for a change of government and a nod to the wave of Canadian patriotism in the face of US tariff threats.",
      "In the final hours of a 36-day campaign, Donald Trump's shadow looms over everything. The winner of Monday's election is likely to be the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals have maintained a narrow lead entering last stretch.",
      "Still, Trump is not the only factor at play - he was only mentioned once in Poilievre's stump speech.",
      "The Conservative leader has focused more on voters disaffected by what he calls a \"Lost Liberal decade\", promising change from a government he blames for the housing shortage and a sluggish economy, and for mishandling social issues like crime and the fentanyl crisis.",
      "His pitch resonates with voters like Eric and Carri Gionet, from Barrie, Ontario. They have two daughters in their mid-20s and said they were attending their first ever political rally.",
      "\"We're pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,\" said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, \"there's no prospect\" their children will be able to do the same.",
      "\"I'm excited to be here,\" said Carri Gionet. \"I'm hopeful.\"",
      "Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.",
      "Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.",
      "Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.",
      "By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.",
      "It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.",
      "Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.",
      "For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is \"baffling\".",
      "\"Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,\" she said. \"It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.\"",
      "For Carney's supporters, they see a strong CV and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,\" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.",
      "Mr Brennan is a \"lifelong Liberal\" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.",
      "The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released \"a massive pressure valve\", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.",
      "\"All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,\" she said.",
      "Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's \"main character\", Ms Kurl said.",
      "\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.\"",
      "It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister never to have held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.",
      "Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.",
      "He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.",
      "Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to \"Canada First\".",
      "Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is \"Trump lite\", with his combative style, his vows to end \"woke ideology\", and willingness to take on the \"global elite\".",
      "\"I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,\" he has said.",

      "\"WFP urges all parties to prioritize the needs of civilians and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately and uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.\"",
      "More than 116,000 tonnes of food assistance - enough to feed one million people for up to four months - is positioned at aid corridors and is ready to be delivered as soon as Israel reopens Gaza's border crossings, according to the agency.",
      "In the meantime, WFP Country Director Antoine Renard told the BBC the agency was trying everything it could to keep the hot meals kitchens running.",
      "\"More than 80% of the population... have been displaced during the war. And just since 18 March [when the Israeli offensive restarted], you've got more than 400,000 people who have been displaced once again,\" he said.",
      "\"Every time you move, every time you lose assets. So these kitchens are so essential for people to have a basic meal.\"",
      "However, even when fully supplied, the kitchens have been reaching just half the population with only 25% of daily food needs.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, humanitarian access manager with the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC from central Gaza that once the kitchens' food stocks ran out they would no longer able to provide anything.",
      "To survive, he said, people were eating less, bartering to \"exchange a bag of diapers for lentils or cooking oil\", or selling what belongings they have left to try to get cash to access remaining food supplies.",
      "He added that begging was also taking place on a scale not seen before in Gaza, but that people were not able to give to others anymore.",
      "\"The desperation is really, really severe.\"",
      "Earlier this week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism of the blockade from the UK, France and Germany, which called it \"intolerable\" and demanded it end immediately in a joint statement.",

      "It also said Israel was not obliged to allow in aid because Hamas had \"hijacked\" supplies \"to rebuild its terror machine\".",
      "Hamas has previously denied stealing aid and the UN has said it has kept \"a very good chain of custody on all the aid it's delivered\".",
      "Last week, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal for a new ceasefire, which included a demand to disarm in return for a six-week pause in hostilities and the release of 10 of the 59 hostages still in captivity. The group reiterated it would hand over all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 51,439 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

    "story": [
      "Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge and charged her with obstruction for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.",
      "Announcing her arrest, FBI director Kash Patel accused Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan of \"intentionally misdirecting\" immigration agents away from a Mexican man they were trying to arrest last week.",
      "\"Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "During a preliminary court hearing on Friday, Dugan's lawyer said she \"wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety\".",
      "The judge has been charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest, and faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted on both charges.",
      "Dugan was released on her own recognisance pending a hearing on 15 May.",
      "The charges stem from events that played out in Dugan's courtroom last week.",
      "On 17 April, an immigration judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national facing three misdemeanour battery counts stemming from a domestic fight, according to court documents filed in the case by the FBI.",
      "The following day, Flores-Ruiz appeared in the Milwaukee court for a scheduled hearing, and six officers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency arrived at the courthouse to make the arrest.",
      "The agents identified themselves to court officials and waited outside Dugan's courtroom, but according to the FBI affidavit, the judge became \"visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers\" when she learned of their presence.",
      "In the hallway outside the court, Dugan and the unnamed agents then argued over the type of arrest warrant that had been issued, before the judge instructed them to report to the office of the county's chief judge.",
      "While several agents were in the office, affidavit says, the judge ushered Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer to a side door meant for jury members leading out of the courtroom.",
      "But two agents remained near the courtroom and spotted Flores-Ruiz attempting to escape, the affidavit says.",
      "Flores-Ruiz, who authorities say had previously been deported from the US in 2013, managed to exit the courthouse but was arrested just minutes later after a short foot chase.",
      "Dugan's arrest came one day after a former judge in New Mexico was taken into custody accused of harbouring an alleged Venezuelan gang member in his home.",
      "\"I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in an interview on Friday.",
      "\"And if you are destroying evidence, if you are obstructing justice, when you have victims sitting in a courtroom of domestic violence, and you're escorting a criminal defendant out a back door, it will not be tolerated.\"",
      "Reaction to the arrest largely split along partisan lines.",
      "Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called it a \"gravely serious and drastic move\".",
      "\"Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.\"",
      "Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson also criticised the arrest, calling it \"showboating\" and warned that it would have a \"chilling effect\" on court proceedings.",
      "Wisconsin's Republican US Senator, Ron Johnson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Dugan was first elected as a judge in 2016, and was re-elected to a second six-year term in 2022.",
      "Judicial elections in Wisconsin are non-partisan, however Dugan was endorsed by Milwaukee's Democratic mayor.",
      "The obstruction charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, while the concealment charges can be punished by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.",
      "In 2019, during the first Trump administration, a judge in Massachusetts was arrested after she allowed an undocumented immigrant defendant to retrieve property from a lockup in the courtroom. The immigrant then left the courtroom.",
      "Judge Shelley M Richmond Joseph was charged with obstruction, but the charges were dropped in 2022, although she still faces an ongoing ethics complaint stemming from the incident."

      "Home to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.",
      "For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.",
      "Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.",
      "Burnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.",
      "Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.",
      "A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.",
      "As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",
      "Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.",
      "But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.",
      "Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.",
      "The cracks in a 'national treasure'",
      "Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.",
      "Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.",
      "Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.",
      "\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"",
      "When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".",
      "Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.",
      "Patients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.",

      "There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.",
      "But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.",
      "That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.",
      "According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.",
      "But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments.

      "When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.",

      "Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.",
      "The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.",
      "\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"",

      "She says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need.",
      "Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.",

      "\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.",
      "On the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.",
      "\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.",
      "His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.",
      "But the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill.",
      "Proposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.",
      "One Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.",
      "Labor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".",
      "But many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference.",
      "There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.",
      "Experts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.",
      "That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats have struggled to land a unified message in President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with fractures both in Congress and among supporters. What comes next for a party in a difficult spot?",
      "The rural, agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, is an odd stop for a pair of East Coast progressive politicians.",
      "After all, Trump won the surrounding county by 20 points, and the dusty fields and endless orchards feel a world away from the party's power centres in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.",
      "Yet Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders packed a local auditorium during a recent stop on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. The rally felt like a 1960s-style sit-in with attendees singing along to a gentle rendition of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land. They launched rowdy boos and jeers every time Sanders inveighed against Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The visit also felt like an answered prayer for local Democrats and left-leaning Independents who oppose Trump and his policies, while directing much of their fury at their own party, which they feel has failed to mount an effective opposition.",
      "The Democratic party \"should be doing more to try to protect everybody,\" said Karla Alcantar, 26, who attended the rally. \"I feel like some of them have just folded over completely, and there are some that are trying to do the work of all.\"",
      "\"I definitely feel like they should be doing way more,\" she said.",
      "Democrats at a crossroads",
      "It is not a great time to be a Democratic politician in the United States. The party is out of power. Elected officials cannot agree on a course of action to counter Trump's agenda. No clear leader has emerged to unify the unwieldy coalition. Various ideological and generational factions are warring against each other and nobody seems to be winning.",
      "\"I understand that they don't have the power to, like, change like things drastically, but they do have the power to slow down like things even a little bit,\" said rally attendee Juan Dominguez, 26. \"It honestly feels like I'm not seeing any of that.\"",
      "The anger extends beyond the rally-goers.",
      "Fifty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said their party's leadership is moving in the wrong direction, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-March, as opposed to 48% who said it is moving in the right direction.",
      "That same survey suggested a desire for strong opposition: 57% wanted Democrats in Congress to try and stop the Republican party's agenda. It's a complete reversal of a poll in 2017, the year after Trump first won the presidency, that suggested 74% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted leaders to work with Republicans following a divisive election.",
      "\"What they're pressing for is not just Democratic leaders to lash out because that's going to make their followers feel good,\" said former Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, who held a town hall-style event in Pittsburgh last week.",
      "Though Lamb said he is not currently running for office, he felt a hunger within the Democratic base.",
      "\"I think they feel like the survival of the system we have all counted on is itself on the line, and they want us to act with that level of urgency,\" Lamb told the BBC. \"I think it's important for us not to forget just to be advocates for things that are specific and concrete, and really affecting people.\"",
      "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's tour is just one attempt to solve that. It stops in conservative-dominated areas and remains laser-focused on the economy, citing cost of living grievances that propelled Trump to a second term, while framing him and his billionaire supporters like Musk as the culprits.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez put the argument simply: \"Oligarchy or democracy?\"",
      "But the Fighting Oligarchy tour is only one theory about how the Democratic Party should evolve.",
      "\"It is completely normal when a party loses, especially the presidency, for there to be this period of soul searching and asking, 'What's next?'\" said Professor Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.",
      "Some Democrats accused their party of falling out of step with more conservative Americans on subjects like transgender rights, or failing to accommodate diverse viewpoints within the party's ideological spectrum. Without widening their potential base, these Democrats argue, they stand little chance of regaining power.",
      "One such gambit by California Governor Gavin Newsom involves moving the party's branding more to the center. Though Newsom has long brushed off White House ambitions, he is among a new generation of Democrats who could vie for the presidency in 2028.",
      "The governor, known nationwide as a liberal defender of abortion and LGBTQ rights, recently launched a podcast to host conversations with politicos who disagree with him.",
      "Newsom's decision to interview right-wing strategist Steve Bannon infuriated many Democrats.",
      "\"I think it's important to have difficult conversations or even have a civil conversation that may be difficult for people to listen to, because everyone is out there trying to tear each other down,\" Newsom said at a recent press conference.",
      "New guard or old guard?",
      "While such debates over whether to moderate or play to the base feature in every party's soul-searching, this year does have a new twist, Mr Grose noted.",
      "\"Some of the questions for the Democrats' strategy is the age question - is it time for a new generation? That is a little unique,\" he said.",
      "David Hogg, 25, a gun safety organiser and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is currently locked in a heated public debate with a party elder statesmen, strategist James Carville.",
      "Hogg recently pledged $20m through his political group to fund primary challengers to Democrats in safe seats.",
      "\"We cannot win back the majority if we do not convince the American people that our party offers something that isn't just, not Donald Trump, but something substantially better,\" he said. \"I think it's time for some new voices in our party.\"",
      "Carville, credited with shepherding Bill Clinton to the White House, called the plan \"insane.\"",
      "\"Aren't we supposed to run against Republicans?\" he asked on CNN.",

    "summary": "After a campaign upended by Trump\u2019s threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.",
    "story": [
      "At a rally in London, Ontario, on Friday, the crowd booed as Mark Carney delivered his core campaign line about the existential threat Canada faces from its neighbour.",
      "\"President Trump is trying to break us so that America could own us,\" the Liberal leader warned.",
      "\"Never,\" supporters shouted back. Many waved Canadian flags taped to ice hockey sticks.",
      "Similar levels of passion were also on display at the union hall where Pierre Poilievre greeted enthusiastic supporters in the Toronto area earlier in the week.",
      "The Conservative leader has drawn large crowds to rallies across the country, where \"Bring it Home\" is a call to arms: both to vote for a change of government and a nod to the wave of Canadian patriotism in the face of US tariff threats.",
      "In the final hours of a 36-day campaign, Donald Trump's shadow looms over everything. The winner of Monday's election is likely to be the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals have maintained a narrow lead entering last stretch.",
      "Still, Trump is not the only factor at play - he was only mentioned once in Poilievre's stump speech.",
      "The Conservative leader has focused more on voters disaffected by what he calls a \"Lost Liberal decade\", promising change from a government he blames for the housing shortage and a sluggish economy, and for mishandling social issues like crime and the fentanyl crisis.",
      "His pitch resonates with voters like Eric and Carri Gionet, from Barrie, Ontario. They have two daughters in their mid-20s and said they were attending their first ever political rally.",
      "\"We're pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,\" said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, \"there's no prospect\" their children will be able to do the same.",
      "\"I'm excited to be here,\" said Carri Gionet. \"I'm hopeful.\"",
      "Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.",
      "Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.",
      "Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.",
      "By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.",
      "It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.",
      "Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.",
      "For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is \"baffling\".",
      "\"Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,\" she said. \"It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.\"",
      "For Carney's supporters, they see a strong CV and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,\" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.",
      "Mr Brennan is a \"lifelong Liberal\" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.",
      "The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released \"a massive pressure valve\", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.",
      "\"All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,\" she said.",
      "Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's \"main character\", Ms Kurl said.",
      "\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.\"",
      "It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister never to have held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.",
      "Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.",
      "He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.",
      "Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to \"Canada First\".",
      "Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is \"Trump lite\", with his combative style, his vows to end \"woke ideology\", and willingness to take on the \"global elite\".",
      "\"I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,\" he has said.",

    "story": [
      "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.",
      "In a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.",
      "Often sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.",
      "Taking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.",
      "Despite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".",
      "The medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.",
      "Her estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.",
      "In the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"",
      "The few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.",
      "Nonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.",
      "\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.",
      "Bertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.",
      "Women's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.",
      "If anything, their success appears to make them targets.",
      "Financial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.",
      "\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.",
      "In South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.",
      "Mr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.",
      "A university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.",
      "It started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.",
      "Despite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.",
      "\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.",
      "Even when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.",
      "\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.",
      "Legal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.",
      "\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"",
      "Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.",
      "Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.",
      "\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.",
      "Ms Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.",
      "\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"",
      "Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.",
      "\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.",
      "She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.",
      "Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.",
      "For Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.",
      "\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.",
      "By the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.",
      "\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.",
      "Dr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: \"Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages.\"",
      "The lecturer could not agree more, urging young women to take their time when getting to know their partners and have open, honest conversations.",
      "\"Talk about the finances, talk about your background, talk about emotions and character.\"",

      "\"They destroyed our identity, and our history,\" Ikhlas Abdel Latif Ahmed, director of museums at Sudan's National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, told the BBC's Newsday programme.",

      "\"The militia [the description Sudanese officials give to the RSF] took so many of the unique and beautiful collections, and destroyed and damaged the rest.\"",
      "Looting has been reported at other Sudanese museums and ancient sites. Last September the UN's world heritage organisation, Unesco, warned of a \"threat to culture\" and urged art dealers not to import or export artefacts smuggled out of Sudan.",
      "Before the war, the National Museum was undergoing rehabilitation, and so many of its treasures were boxed up.",
      "That may have made it easier for the collections to be removed.",
      "Sudanese officials say precious artefacts from the National Museum were taken away to be sold.",
      "They strongly suspect RSF fighters took some of the valuables to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They produced no evidence. However the UN panel of experts on Sudan has reported that the RSF has been exporting significant quantities of gold to the UAE, since even before the war.",
      "The UAE has also been widely accused of funding the RSF, although both parties have always denied these accusations.",
      "\"We had a strong room for the gold collection, they managed to open it and took all the gold,\" Ms Ahmed said.",
      "\"Maybe they kept it for themselves, or maybe they traded it in the market.\"",
      "So the whereabouts of pieces like a gold collar from the pyramid of King Talakhamani at Nuri, which dates to the 5th Century BC, are unknown.",
      "Asked about the value of what was taken, Ms Ahmed replied simply: \"There is no value for the museum artefacts, it's more expensive than you could imagine.\"",
      "The de facto government of Sudan says it will contact Interpol and Unesco to attempt to recover artefacts looted from the National Museum and elsewhere.",
      "However recovering the artefacts seems a difficult and perhaps even dangerous task, with little immediate prospect of success.",
      "The government, and other Sudanese observers, say the RSF's attacks against museums, universities and buildings like the National Records Office are a conscious attempt to destroy the Sudanese state - but, again, the RSF denies this.",

    "story": [
      "The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation.",
      "Standing in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta's future.",
      "Who thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands.",
      "Who thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands.",
      "\"How many people would like Alberta to join the US?\" Another show of support from half the crowd.",
      "Mr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.",
      "The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.",
      "Mr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.",
      "\"We're not interested in that\", he said. \"We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.\"",
      "Jeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.",
      "\"We have a lot more culturally in common with our neighbours to the south in Montana\u2026 [and] with our cousins in Texas, than we do anywhere else,\" he said.",
      "Previously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open.",
      "In an opinion piece for national newspaper the Globe and Mail, Preston Manning - an Albertan considered one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in Canada - warned \"large numbers of Westerners simply will not stand for another four years of Liberal government, no matter who leads it\".",
      "Accusing the party of mismanaging national affairs and ignoring the priorities of western Canadians, he added: \"A vote for the Carney Liberals is a vote for Western secession \u2013 a vote for the breakup of Canada as we know it.\"",
      "This sense of \"western alienation\", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskachtewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.",
      "That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.",
      "Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.",
      "She said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.",
      "\"He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?\" Ms Schneider said.",
      "An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.",
      "Political analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would \"not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,\" Mr Modry, the activist, said.",
      "That wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.",
      "In Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a \"national unity crisis\" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.",
      "While Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as \"nonsense\", critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada's future.",
      "Even those within the separatist movement have different ideas on how best to achieve their goals.",
      "Lorna Guitton, a born-and-bred Albertan and a volunteer with the Alberta Prosperity Project, told the BBC in Lethbridge that her aim was for the province to have a better relationship with the rest of Canada.",
      "She described the current union as \"broken\", and believes a referendum, or the threat of it, will give Albertans \"leverage\" in future negotiations with Ottawa.",
      "But Ms Guitton also dismissed any notion of it becoming a 51st US state.",
      "\"They've got enough of their own problems. Why would I want to be part of that?\" she said. \"I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada.\"",

    "summary": "BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.",
      "\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.",
      "Doge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.",
      "BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.",
      "Our analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.",
      "How does Doge report savings?",
      "In October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026.",
      "The US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.",
      "Doge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.",
      "However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.",
      "We downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases.",
      "Our analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence.",
      "US media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.",
      "Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".",
      "What's the evidence behind the biggest saving?",
      "BBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.",
      "The department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.",
      "For three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.",
      "The documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.",
      "David Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution.",
      "\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.",
      "\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"",
      "So if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.",
      "Doge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn.",
      "It comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.",
      "Doge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure.",
      "But the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.",
      "A source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.",
      "\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.",
      "They say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.",
      "They also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.",
      "We contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.",
      "What about the other big savings?",
      "The second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.",
      "The document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.",
      "However, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.",
      "He said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.",

      "Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plunge",
      "Will Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?",
      "The contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.",
      "However, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration.",
      "The company did not respond to our requests for further comment.",
      "Another IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving.",
      "Doge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT.",
      "On the contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.",
      "Again, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.",
      "It is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.",
      "The fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.",
      "Doge links to a page on USASpending.gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m.",
      "Gavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated.",
      "\"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us.",
      "We have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from.",

      "Softly at first then louder, as if to encourage those who joined in timidly, the nuns broke into Ave Maria.",
      "Every so often they shuffled a few inches forward, following the queue for Pope Francis's lying in state. And all the while they sang, their faces turned to St Peter's Basilica to their left, their white veils glistening under their large sun hats.",
      "It was a fitting sight for an extraordinary week in which Rome seemed to regain its reputation as the \"capital of the world\" \u2013 and St Peter's Square as the centre of the Catholic universe.",
      "There is mourning, but also recognition that the Pope, who lived to 88, died quickly and peacefully. \"At least he didn't suffer,\" many say. Yet this isn't the time for celebration either - that will have to wait until after the funeral, when the conclave will spark the usual frenzy of excitement, intrigue and inevitable speculation.",
      "Before then, in Rome these in-between days have taken on a flavour of their own.",
      "Elena, a Romanian woman in her 50s, said she had noticed a \"pensive\" atmosphere in the city. \"There are big crowds around but I have felt everything was a bit quieter, there is something different in the air,\" she told the BBC, guessing that the Pope's death was encouraging people to \"look inside\" more.",
      "She added that everyone she spoke to this week \u2013 even non-believers \u2013 had been marked by his death somehow.",
      "Her friend Lina agreed. She was standing behind the counter of her tobacconist shop in Borgo Pio, a quiet cobblestoned street lined with buildings in earthy tones and flower boxes near the Vatican. \"It's neither a week of tragedy nor one of celebration,\" she said. \"It's a chance for people to think, to reflect, and I think that's much needed.\"",
      "Nearby, people slowly ambled down Via della Conciliazione \u2013 the pedestrian street that connects Italy and the Vatican city state, and the same one the Pope's coffin will travel down on Saturday as he reaches his final place of rest in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.",
      "The 4th Century church is only located around 4km away from St Peter's, but the journey there is set to take around two hours as the car carrying the Pope's coffin will move at walking pace to allow people lining the streets to see it and say their goodbyes, the Vatican said earlier this week.",
      "Two plain-clothed police officers acknowledged that the neighbourhood was much busier than usual, but that it \"felt like a Saturday,\" and that people had been very relaxed.",
      "Security operation in full swing",
      "Still, the signs of the huge security operation mounted by the Vatican and Italian authorities were everywhere.",
      "On Wednesday, a soldier stood outside a religious goods shop brandishing a hefty bazooka-like anti-drone device. Asked whether the contraption could, for instance, disrupt drone frequencies and force them to return to their bases, he replied mysteriously: \"Maybe, among other things.\"",
      "Next to him, a fellow soldier scanned the sky with binoculars. On the day of the funeral, they will be joined by thousands of security personnel from various branches of the police and armed forces, as well as river patrol units, bomb-sniffing dogs and rooftop snipers.",
      "American student Caislyn, who was sat on a bench sketching the dome of St Peter's, said she was \"shocked\" at how safe she felt despite the number of people around.",
      "The 21-year-old attributed that to the fact that \"people are here to pay their respects to Francis, and to enjoy this beautiful city.\" She called the atmosphere \"bittersweet,\" but said she saw the funeral as a \"celebration of life\".",

      "What time does the funeral start?",
      "Archbishops and bishops started gathering at 08:30 local time (07:30 BST) in the Constantine Wing, a corridor adjacent to St Peter's Basilica.",
      "At the same time, Catholic priests will congregate in St Peter's Square.",
      "Half an hour later, at 09:00 local time, patriarchs from the Orthodox church and cardinals will congregate in Saint Sebastian Chapel, inside the basilica, where the remains of Pope John Paul II lie.",
      "They will walk in a funeral procession accompanying the Pope's coffin, which has spent the last four days in the centre of St Peter's Basilica.",
      "The funeral starts at 10:00 when the coffin is laid in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica. The service will be led by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.",
      "You can follow the order of service in full here.",
      "\u200b\u200bGuests and dignitaries will be seated closer to the basilica and coffin, with thousands of other clergy and members of the public in and around St Peter's Square, similar to the funeral for Pope Benedict XVI shown below.",
      "The service will end with prayers for Pope Francis and a final commendation - a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted to God.",
      "This marks the beginning of a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales with a mass held every day in his memory.",
      "Who will be attending?",
      "Officials expect at least 250,000 members of the public to attend the funeral and there are some 170 heads of state or government on the guestlist.",
      "Prince William will represent King Charles III, continuing a precedent set in 2005 when the then-Prince of Wales attended Pope John Paul II's funeral on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "Other heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance, including US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "How can you tell a bishop from a cardinal?",
      "There will also be hundreds of members of the clergy, with each group having a specific dress code for the service.",
      "For bishops and archbishops, the liturgical clothes for a funeral include the alb, a white tunic held by a traditional cord called cincture, the amice, a short linen cloth to cover the neck, and a red chasuble, a solemn cape, in honour of the pope. Finally, they don a simple white linen or silk mitre on their heads.",
      "Cardinals wear similar clothes, but they can be distinguished by their more ornate damask pattern mitres, which look cream rather than white.",
      "Priests wear simpler garments and a long scarf over their tunic called a red stole.",

      "The route crosses the river Tiber and passes the Colosseum.",
      "He will become the first Pope since Leo XIII, who died in 1903, to be buried outside the Vatican.",
      "How has Francis changed traditions?",
      "Traditionally, the Pope's remains would have been enclosed the day before the funeral in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead, and oak.",
      "The cypress coffin symbolised humility and mortality; the outer oak coffin, a sign of 'dignity and strength' and the lead coffin, welded to preserve the remains and prevent tampering.",
      "Last year, however, Pope Francis requested that he be buried in a simpler wooden coffin with a zinc interior.",
      "This is the coffin that will be seen in the funeral service.",
      "According to Monsignor Diego Ravelli, the Vatican's master of liturgical ceremonies, the request emphasised \"even more that the Roman Pontiff's funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world\".",
      "Why did Francis choose burial site?",
      "Pope Francis was a Jesuit - a Catholic religious order of priests known for their dedication to education and missionary work.",
      "He was also a devotee of the Virgin Mary and as such, he chose to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore, which sits outside the Vatican walls in the centre of Rome.",
      "The church houses the Salus Populi Romani, a Byzantine icon of the Virgin believed to have been made by St Luke the Evangelist and used by Jesuit orders all over the world.",
      "In his will, written in 2022, Pope Francis said: \"Throughout my life, and during my ministry as a priest and bishop, I have always entrusted myself to the Mother of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary.\"",
      "\"I wish my final earthly journey to end precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary, where I would always stop to pray at the beginning and end of every Apostolic Journey, confidently entrusting my intentions to the Immaculate Mother, and giving thanks for her gentle and maternal care,\" he wrote.",
      "On his first day as Pope in 2013, Francis left the Vatican to pray in Santa Maria Maggiore.",
      "Seven popes are buried in the same basilica in ornamented tombs, however, the Argentinian pontiff asked that his tomb would be in the side aisle, between the Pauline Chapel (Chapel of Salus Populi Romani) and the Sforza Chapel, close to a statue known as the Mary Regina Pacis (Mary, Queen of Peace).",
      "\"Near that Queen of Peace, to whom I have always turned for help and whose embrace I have sought more than a hundred times during my pontificate,\" he explained in his will.",
      "The Pope also asked that his tomb would be in the ground, simple and bearing only the inscription \"Franciscus\", the Latin version of his chosen name.",
      "How can you watch the funeral?",
      "We will be broadcasting the funeral here on the BBC News website and app as part of our live coverage and it will also be available to watch on the iPlayer.",

    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",
      "While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.",
      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",

    "summary": "The mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.",
      "The mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.",
      "Nowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings.",
      "In Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",
      "In October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos.",
      "\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"",
      "\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.",
      "When asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.",
      "Over many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.",
      "\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.",
      "\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.",
      "\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"",
      "Typically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.",
      "Dr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"",
      "They are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.",
      "Gaza in maps: How 15 months of war have drastically changed the territory",
      "Gaza war death toll could be significantly higher, researchers say",
      "Experts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive.",
      "\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.",
      "\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said.",
      "Many are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added.",
      "After a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.",
      "There are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.",
      "Globally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.",
      "As well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer.",
      "A further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.",
      "Dr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".",
      "For years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.",
      "\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".",
      "As of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period.",
      "The US and a group of Arab States have proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.",
      "\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\"",
      "A UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\".",
      "A UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (\u00a3929m).",
      "The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

      "\"The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,\" he said. \"We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. \"",
      "Speaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.",
      "\"To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,\" he wrote, \"not Palestinian freedom\".",
      "Wasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.",
      "\"We need to take a risk and speak out,\" he replied without hesitation.",
      "\"I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.\"",
      "Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.",

      "Al-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.",
      "Days earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.",
      "\"Gaza has become a city of ghosts,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder.",
      "\"I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.\"",
      "At his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.",
      "Last summer, Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.",
      "Masked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.",
      "Now living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.",
      "\"Hamas' power has begun to fade,\" he told me.",
      "\"It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.\"",
      "Before the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.",
      "But now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.",

      "Beit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.",
      "In a series of voice notes, an eyewitness \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.",
      "On 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.",
      "\"They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,\" the eyewitness told us.",
      "\"But he refused.\"",
      "The incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out.",
      "\"They were not intimidated by the bullets,\" the eyewitness said of the protesters.",

      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",

      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "VISUAL GUIDE: How the next Pope is chosen by secret vote",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

    "story": [
      "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.",
      "Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".",
      "Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "China can take the pain (to a point)",
      "China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.",
      "With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.",
      "Beijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change.",
      "And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.",
      "The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.",
      "China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.",
      "Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.",
      "The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.",
      "The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".",
      "President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"",
      "China has been investing in the future",
      "China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.",
      "Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.",
      "It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.",
      "Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.",
      "Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.",
      "US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.",
      "That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",
      "Lessons from Trump 1.0",
      "Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.",
      "It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.",
      "American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.",
      "\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.",
      "The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.",
      "That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.",
      "Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".",
      "That would be an impossible choice for much of the world",
      "\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.",
      "China now knows when Trump will blink",
      "Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".",
      "But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.",
      "Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.",
      "China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.",
      "Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".",
      "But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.",
      "Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.",
      "China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"",
      "A chokehold on rare earths",
      "What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.",
      "China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.",
      "Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.",
      "China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.",
      "In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.",
      "The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously.",

      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",
      "But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\".",
      "\"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said.",
      "However, he also said that: \"Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\"",
      "And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.",
      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",
      "\"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\"",

    "summary": "The singer-songwriter - subject of the new Broadway musical \"Just in Time\" - was renowned for such pop hits as \"Splish Splash,\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Dream Lover.\" But his life was unsettled when he learned, at age 32, the startling truth about the identity of his mother.",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Darin was a major pop star \u2026 a singer, dancer, musician, and an Oscar nominee. He was the entertainer who did it all, except Broadway. Until now!",
      "Tony Award-winner Jonathan Groff (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") plays the icon of the late 1950s and '60s in the musical \"Just in Time.\" \"He was at the height of his powers, when he was on the floor of a nightclub with the audience in the palm of his hand,\" said Groff.",
      "For Darin, a live audience was oxygen. So, too, for Groff: \"You can feel this vibration between performer and audience member. [It's], to me, the most essential thing to ignite in the telling of his story.\"",
      "It's taken seven years and a whole lot of sweat to bring the show to Broadway. The casting of Groff \u2013 beloved for his roles on stage, and as Kristoff in the \"Frozen\" movies \u2013 might not seem obvious. Groff grew up on a horse farm in Pennsylvania Mennonite country; Darin was a scrappy Italian kid from the Bronx.",
      "I asked Groff to whom he liked listening when he was growing up. \"I am in fourth or fifth grade, on the computer or Nintendo in the basement, blasting Ethel Merman, 'Annie Get Your Gun,'\" he laughed.",
      "\"So, this is the 1990s, probably? And you're playing something from the 1940s?\"",
      "\"Exactly!\"",
      "Likewise, Bobby Darin was an old soul, says his son, Dodd Darin. \"He admired, he loved, he respected the old timers. He loved that era of show business. That's what he related to.\"",
      "That may have had something to do with the woman who raised him: \"Polly, his mother, was an old vaudevillian,\" said Dodd. \"And she nurtured him and said, 'You can't play stickball in the street. And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

      "Legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert celebrated his 90th birthday last month by taking the stage at Jazz at Lincoln Center with a new iteration of the Tijuana Brass, marking his return to the iconic group format for the first time in 40 years.",
      "The milestone performance coincides with the 60th anniversary of his landmark album \"Whipped Cream & Other Delights,\" which spent eight weeks at No. 1 after its 1965 release and helped define the sound of the era.",
      "\"It has been overwhelming. I didn't realize I'd get this much attention at 90,\" Alpert said.",
      "Alpert's distinctive brass sound, inspired by bullfights in Tijuana, dominated the 1960s music landscape \u2014 appearing in television commercials, game shows like \"The Dating Game,\" and films including \"Casino Royale.\" At his commercial peak in 1966, Alpert had three albums in the top five simultaneously and outsold The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra.",
      "\"Sometimes I was even a little embarrassed by it all,\" Alpert admitted.",
      "His classic hit \"Ladyfingers\" recently found new life on TikTok, generating what Alpert described as \"three billion streams\" on YouTube, a phenomenon he finds \"strange, because I recorded it like 60 years ago.\"",
      "The trumpet virtuoso's career hasn't been without challenges. By 1969, while going through a divorce, Alpert faced a personal crisis with his instrument. He described the trumpet as \"my enemy\" as he struggled with confidence and technique. A breakthrough came after consulting New York brass teacher Carmine Caruso, who reminded him that the trumpet was \"just a piece of plumbing\" and that \"the instrument comes from deep inside you.\"",
      "Alpert also co-founded A&M Records with the late Jerry Moss, operating on a handshake agreement from 1962 until they sold the company in 1990. The two never signed a formal contract, a fact that still moves Alpert to tears when he recalls their partnership.",
      "Now touring with a newly assembled Tijuana Brass, Alpert says the music feels fresh again. Alpert continues to perform with his wife of 52 years, singer Lani Hall, whom he met when his label signed Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66.",
      "\"I try to be as authentic as I can when I play,\" he said. \"I'm playing in the moment of my life. And it's a hard place to get to. But that's the place I'm always looking for.\"",

      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",
      "For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,I am the very model of a modern Major-General!",

    "story": [
      "Tina Knowles, the mother of global music superstars Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, is opening up about her personal relationship with her mother, details about her divorces, her own parenting and the girl group Destiny's Child.",
      "Knowles, a businesswoman, fashion designer and former stylist for Destiny's Child, is telling her life story in her memoir, \"Matriarch,\" where she reveals a complicated but loving relationship with her own mother, who she described as \"overprotective\" and \"fearful.\"",
      "At one point, Knowles said she wanted to be a singer herself and was even in a girl group known as The Veltones.",
      "\"I wanted to be a singer, but you know, this little town was about that big and there were no singers there and that's what my mom said. My mom, as, you know, as much as I loved her and she wanted the best for me, she would've done anything for me to be a singer, she really didn't have any hope.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview that that aspect of her upbringing influenced how she parented.",
      "\"I was gonna trust my kids and even though I never believed in being friends, \u2026 but I wanted to be trusted by them,\" she said, adding that she wanted them to know the sky was the limit when it came to achieving their dreams.",
      "\"'Cause my parents put limitations on me. Not because they wanted to, because they didn't want me to be disappointed or hurt,\" she said. \"I told my girls that all the time, you could be whatever you wanna be. You could do whatever you wanna do and I'm gonna be right there to help make it happen.\"",
      "Impact on parenting",
      "Knowles spoke with King about how different her daughters were growing up. She said once a teacher recommended Beyonc\u00e9 repeat a grade in school. Knowles said, now a global superstar, Beyonc\u00e9 was shy and quiet until she got to know people.",
      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",
      "\"I took her to Ms. Little. ... Was an ex-teacher there who was very stern, but she said, 'there's nothing wrong with this girl. This girl is very bright. She just doesn't care to let you know it.'\"",
      "Conversely, Knowles described Solange as \"very outgoing\" and would \"walk into the room and be like, 'yes, I'm here.'\"",
      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",
      "\"He was like, 'I don't want any parts of that,'\" Knowles said.",
      "For Knowles it was important as she started to see separation between her two daughters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 had become like this little star in the town and she was always so close to Solange and so kind to her, but then she was in the singing group, so everything took place in our house,\" she said. The other girls in the group would tell Solange to shut up and be quiet and all that and I started noticing that she wasn't protecting her sister.\"",
      "Knowles' goal through therapy was to ensure the two grew up close, telling King, \"whatever I have to do to make that happen.\"",
      "Beginnings of Destiny's Child",
      "Knowles said she tried to be a singer, and although for her it didn't work out, she used her skills to help her daughters achieve their dreams.",
      "\"God has always given me these tools from day one that I could go back and pull out and who would've ever thought that I would wind up making costumes for Destiny's Child? Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",
      "Knowles said the criticism from the label hurt her feelings, but it was a moment she remembers her husband, Mathew, pushing back.",
      "\"He was just bold and when I talk about him, that's one of the things that he went to bat for me all the time, he fought, he protected me.\"",
      "Navigating marriage and parenting criticisms",
      "Knowles also wrote candidly in her memoir about the highs and lows of her 30-year marriage to Mathew Knowles.",
      "She said from the beginning, there was infidelity in their marriage on his part and she realized she needed to be prepared.",
      "\"I was pregnant and things were \u2014 they just got really bad at that time. I knew that I had to make a move and I didn't want to be dependent on him,\" she said.",
      "She started planning what she called her escape plan. Knowles opened a hair salon called Headliners, which was so successful it became the family's main source of income and helped to fund Beyonc\u00e9's budding musical career. Mathew Knowles left his sales executive role at Xerox and started working as Destiny's Child's manager full-time. Their partnership as parents helped to hold their marriage together.",
      "\"People say to me, 'how did you stay so long?' And I'm like, 'well, I was married for 33 years, but 33 years were not bad.' \u2026 You know, maybe 15 of them were bad, but we would have these long stretches where we would do really great.\"",
      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",
      "Knowles went on to say, people didn't understand Solange's history.",
      "\"They didn't know the backstory of Solange losing her best friend and wanting to hurry up and be a grownup 'cause she thought she wouldn't live so long.\"",
      "Knowles said Solange made it clear she was getting married.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, well let me at least give you a wedding,' you know, and made it memorable for her,\u00a0 but you can't control somebody else's life. It's their life.\"",
      "Knowles also wrote about an untrue rumor that surfaced during Beyonc\u00e9's first pregnancy, where people said she wasn't carrying the baby.",
      "\"She went on a show in Australia and she had this very broad cloth type of dress,\" Knowles said about Beyonc\u00e9. \"She wasn't huge pregnant. She was very proud of her little stomach and she bent over and the fabric of the dress bent \u2026 they started this vicious, horrible rumor that she wasn't pregnant.\"",
      "Knowles expressed her heartache over the situation and anger over people thinking her daughter faked a pregnancy and used prosthetics.",
      "\"I was never so enraged because this should have been a sacred experience and what they didn't know is that my child had been through a couple miscarriages, which were so painful.\"",
      "Knowles admitted she did not speak up even as the devastating rumor escalated, saying that Beyonc\u00e9 thought it would go away and handles these situations well.",
      "\"I'm not so good at that. I will cuss you out about my kids,\" Knowles said. \"That was one of the worst times of my life. It really was. I would cry, I would get so mad and I would get so upset.\"",
      "Divorces and moving forward",
      "When she decided to get divorced from Mathew Knowles, she said she spent a week in bed depressed. Her longtime therapist gave her an exercise to do: Make a list of accomplishments and failures.",
      "\"I had such an easy time writing the bad stuff. When I got to the positive stuff, I had such a hard time,\" she said. \"What I realized about myself is that I wasn't really comfortable with people telling me great things about me.\"",
      "She said she had not taken credit for some of her accomplishments in the past, like her work with Destiny's Child in an effort to be humble. She would tell herself, \"it's not about you.\"",
      "But then she started making her list.",
      "\"I started getting mad and writing those things down,\" she said. \"I started my salon. It was a success. You know, I raised some great kids. All the people I've met in my life, like I have had a hell of a life.\"",
      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",
      "She said she would love to find love again, but is at peace if she doesn't.",
      "\"I am finally feeling \u2014 it is sad that I'm 71 years old and I know that I am enough and if I don't I'm gonna be just fine because I got such a full, great life. And I'm so blessed, and you know, it's gonna be \u2013 it's all good.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism.",
      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",
      "\"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said.",
      "The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meeting earlier this month.",
      "Bhattacharya told reporters earlier this week that he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than the initial timeline outlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said.",

      "California is providing the gift cards at the clinics, which are run by the state's vendor. The CDC also has a testing van from the agency's Avian Flu Influenza Area Surveillance Testing, or AFAST project, offering testing at some of the sites.",
      "\"Funding for the gift cards comes out of California's bird flu state emergency declaration funds. CDC does testing only and offers no incentives of any kind,\" a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health said in an email.",
      "The effort runs contrary to rumors on social media that states have stopped testing symptomatic farmworkers for bird flu, at the behest of the CDC under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"There has been no change to our guidance for testing suspect cases, we are not aware of any symptomatic workers not being referred or tested for H5N1, and it is very unlikely that testing would be declined if H5N1 was suspected,\" the California spokesperson said.",
      "A CDC spokesperson also said their guidance had not changed. The agency continues to recommend people with symptoms seek testing from their doctor or local health department.",
      "Authorities in neighboring Nevada told CBS News they are also continuing to offer testing and treatment to farm workers exposed to bird flu infections in their animals. In Idaho, another state that had seen bird flu infections in farms, authorities said they had not heard of symptomatic workers being discouraged from getting tested.",

Health departments typically announce those \"presumptive\" detections, even if they turn out later not to be confirmed.",

      "\"To date, all samples tested have been confirmed as seasonal subtypes H1 or H3, which rules out infection with H5N1 [bird flu]. The fact that no other human cases of H5N1 have been identified via subtyping efforts is reassuring,\" the California spokesperson said.",

    "summary": "Trump's ratings on economy are lower, but his deportation plan keeps majority support.",
    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large eight in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",
      "And on the other side of the aisle, many Democrats describe their feelings about how their party is handling the Trump administration as making them feel frustrated and nervous.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,356\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 23-25, 2025.

The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new analysis from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which President Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:21:05 -0400",
    "summary": "Prices on thousands of of goods sold on Amazon, Temu and Shein are rising as U.S. tariffs on China boost import costs.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",
      "\"The chances are that tariffs on China are cut from their current more than 100% effective rate, but there is no clear timeline,\" analysts with Oxford Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report on Friday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-baby-bonus-5000-5k-2025-white-house/",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:08:16 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said that a baby bonus provided to new parents could be a \"good idea.\" Here's how it's worked in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",
      "That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of a bill advancing in Congress.",

      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20 points, or 0.1%, to close at 40,114, while the S&P 500 added 40 points, or 0.7%, to close at 5,525. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3% thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks, including Nvidia.",
      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer stance on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision to reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report\u00a0that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",
      "In a Time interview released Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks.",
      "CEOs: \"Elevated uncertainty\"",
      "On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\"",
      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",
      "While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief. The 10-year Treasury fell from a peak of 4.4% earlier this week to 4.3% on Friday, while the value of the U.S. dollar ticked up to throughout the week, strengthening against the euro and other rival currencies.",

    "summary": "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg says his tariff costs will surge more than 40-fold to $100 million, while sales could fall.",
    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",
      "\"There's not much I can do as an individual, so the limited choices I can make, like switching an airline, is definitely within my ability,\" he told CBS News Bay Area.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "As the late pontiff lies in state in St. Peter's Basilica\u00a0before his funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, April 26, Americans are searching for flights to pay their respects in person. Flight searches to Rome surged 250% in the three days following Pope Francis' death on Monday, compared with searches over the same period in 2024, according to travel booking site Expedia.com.",

      "\"I can't think of any other event that has caused a sudden spike in travel searches like this,\" Expedia travel expert Melanie Fish told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And it's not only flight searches. It's accommodation searches, too, and it's clear why because of the travel dates.\"",
      "Scott Keyes, founder and CEO of flight deals website Going.com, said search interest in travel to Rome for April 21-23 has nearly tripled since the pope's death, compared with the three previous days.",
      "For tourists thinking of booking a jaunt to Italy, the bad news is that the surge in demand for fights to Rome is driving up airfares, according to Going.com. For flights from the U.S. to Rome departing between April 22-25 and returning April 27-30, airfares are up about 33% compared to flight prices in the days leading up to Pope Francis' death.",

The moves came after weeks of escalation between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\"",

On behalf of our current and future students, and all who work at and benefit from our institutions, we call for constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.\"",

The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "summary": "Federal health officials want companies to swap out certain food dyes with natural alternatives.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",

      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

      "Trump administration border czar Tom Homan argued Sunday that \"due process\" was applied when a two-year-old child who is a U.S. citizen was removed to Honduras along with her mother, who was deported.",
      "Louisiana Federal District Court Judge Terry Doughty wrote in an order Friday that there was a \"strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process,\" after the 2-year-old was sent to Honduras with her mother and 11-year-old sister.",
      "But Homan said \"the judge was due process,\" adding on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the two-year-old's mother \"had due process at great taxpayer expense and was ordered by an immigration judge after those hearings, so she had due process.\"",
      "Doughty, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, sought to arrange a phone call with the mother of the two-year-old on Friday, but Justice Department lawyers informed him that a call with the child's mother would not be possible, according to court documents. Meanwhile, the two-year-old's father tried to petition the court to have the child's legal custody temporarily transferred to a relative who is a U.S. citizen.",
      "When asked by Brennan about the timeframe and process allowed, Homan reiterated that \"there was due process.\"",
      "\"The two-year-old went with the mom. The mom signed the paper, saying 'I want my two-year-old to go with me,'\" Homan said. \"That's a parent's decision, it's not a government decision.\"",
      "The two-year-old is among three children who are American citizens who were deported Friday with their mothers from the U.S. to Honduras, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News. Homan disputed the characterization, saying, \"we don't deport U.S. citizens\" and added\u00a0that in these cases, \"the mother chose to take the children with her.\"",
      "\"This is parenting 101,\" Homan said. \"You can decide to take that child with you, or you can decide to leave a child here with a relative or another spouse.\"",
      "Among the children deported was a four-year-old with Stage 4 cancer, advocates said. The \"border czar\" said he wasn't aware of that specific case. Homan argued that when someone enters the country illegally and chooses to have a child, automatically granting the child American citizenship, \"that's on you, that's not on this administration.\"",
      "\"Having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country legally is not a get out jail free card,\" Homan said. He added that it doesn't make people \"immune from our laws.\"",
      "The development comes as the Trump administration has conducted rapid deportations as it pursues an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. The moves have at times led to several court battles, including in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly among a group of men deported to a prison in El Salvador last month.",
      "More than 230 men, mostly Venezuelans, were deported on March 15 to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, although U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., had ordered that the planes be turned around. The Trump administration says it can remove immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was previously used during wartime. The case worked its way up to the Supreme Court, which at first ruled the deportations could continue as long as they were given due process.",
      "The Supreme Court last week temporarily blocked any new deportations from a detention center in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act.",

      "Congressional committees are set to begin work this week on the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's first-year agenda, after both the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution that serves as a blueprint before leaving town for recess. The plan is a key step toward implementing Mr. Trump's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes, and GOP leaders in Congress have circled an ambitious goal of getting it to the president's desk by Memorial Day.",

      "President Trump made clear Sunday that he would not follow his predecessor's practice of recognizing\u00a0Indigenous Peoples Day\u00a0alongside Columbus Day in October, accusing Democrats of denigrating the explorer's legacy as he pressed his campaign to restore\u00a0what he argues are traditional American icons.",
      "Democrat Joe Biden was the\u00a0first president\u00a0to mark Indigenous Peoples Day, issuing a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0in 2021 that celebrated \"the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples\" and recognize \"their inherent sovereignty.\"",
      "The proclamation noted that America \"was conceived on a promise of equality and opportunity for all people\" but that promise \"we have never fully lived up to. That is especially true when it comes to upholding the rights and dignity of the Indigenous people who were here long before colonization of the Americas began.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday used a social media post to declare, \"I'm bringing Columbus Day back from the ashes.\" He said on his Truth Social site that \"the Democrats did everything possible to destroy Christopher Columbus, his reputation, and all of the Italians that love him so much.\"",
      "He said he is \"hereby reinstating Columbus Day under the same rules, dates, and locations, as it has had for all of the many decades before!\"",
      "The federal holiday, the second Monday in October, was still known as Columbus Day during Biden's term, but also as Indigenous Peoples Day. It remained a federal holiday and the former president didn't make any changes as to how or when Columbus Day is recognized in his proclamation, in which he directed\u00a0the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings \"in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.\"",
      "Biden's recognition had been a longtime goal of activists who wanted to shift the focus from commemorating Columbus' navigation to the Americas to his and his successors' exploitation of the indigenous people he encountered there.",

New York is among many places that acknowlodge both names of the federal holiday, with Gov. Kathy Hocul first recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day in 2021 while New York City continues to hold the largest Columbus Day parade in the country.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has long objected to telling the country's history through a lens of diversity and oppression, the holiday he seeks to restore to its primacy was added to the calendar as a nod to the country's growing diversity.",
      "Columbus' expeditions never touched the North American continent, let alone any land that is now part of the United States. But the native of Genoa became increasingly commemorated in the United States as Italian immigrants flocked to the country and politicians sought to win their support.",
      "Indeed, it was the lynching of 11 Italian-American immigrants in New Orleans in 1891 that led to the first Columbus Day celebration in the United States, led the following year by President Benjamin Harrison.\u00a0President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u00a0designated Columbus Day as a national holiday in 1934.",
      "Mr. Trump has long complained about Democrats tearing down statues of Columbus, a complaint he made again in Sunday's post. In 2017, he spoke out against a review of the 76-foot-tall statue of the explorer in New York's Columbus Circle that then-Mayor Bill de Blasio had ordered. It remains in place today, but other statues have been defaced or torn down.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration paid to restore a Columbus statue in Baltimore that was dumped in the harbor during protests against the police murder of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0in Minneapolis.

    "summary": "\"The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again,\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"created chaos\" at the Pentagon amid staffing shakeups\u00a0and recent reporting surrounding information about airstrikes in Yemen shared in Signal group chats.",
      "\"The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again,\" Shaheen said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Hegseth, a 44-year-old Army veteran and former Fox News host, faced scrutiny during the confirmation process early this year, becoming among President Trump's most embattled picks for top posts in his administration. The Senate ultimately approved his confirmation in a narrow vote. But in recent weeks, he's faced renewed scrutiny over the use of the encrypted messaging app Signal.",
      "Last week, reports circulated that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group, which included his wife, his brother and personal attorney. It was the second Signal group chat where Hegseth shared the information, after it was revealed last month a journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat where the timing and targets of the attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared.",
      "CBS News reported Friday that the Pentagon set up a system in Hegseth's office that enabled him to check messages on Signal while at the office. Two of the sources said the system bypasses standard Defense Department security protocols. A Defense Department spokesperson denied there is currently any use of Signal inside Hegseth's office.",
      "Meanwhile, a number of political appointees have resigned or been fired at the Pentagon in recent days, leaving Hegseth without some key staff.",
      "Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued that Hegseth has shown he isn't qualified for the role by sharing the information over Signal and by not having appropriate staff to support him, accusing him of creating \"chaos that is now embroiling our uniform military.\" She added that he has \"not taken responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "\"For those people who serve under him, he has shown that he is not the kind of role model, not the kind of leader that we need at this time,\" Shaheen said.",
      "In response to Shaheen's comments, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell instead pointed to the previous administration. Parnell cited \"Chaos at the Pentagon\" as evidenced by the Afghanistan withdrawal and \"a divisive DEl culture that destroyed service member morale.\" He also pointed to a \"weak leadership\" that he said led to Russia invading Ukraine, Hamas attacking Israel, and Houthi rebels shooting at U.S. ships, along with the \"the invasion of our U.S. southern border by transnational criminal gangs.\"",
      "\"During all this very real chaos, not a single person was fired or held accountable and Sen. Shaheen stayed silent,\" Parnell said. \"Secretary Hegseth is bringing accountability and warfighting back to the Pentagon. The American people care about results \u2014 so far SecDef gets an A+.\"",
      "In March, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, announced a bipartisan request for an expedited watchdog investigation into the Signal chat leak. Shaheen said it's \"important\" that the request was bipartisan, adding that she's hopeful \"they will come out soon with recommendations.\"",
      "The GOP-led Senate Armed Forces Committee advanced Hegseth's appointment in January, and Shaheen was joined by all fellow Democrats on the committee in voting against advancing him. Vice President JD Vance had to break the tie to confirm Hegseth, the first time in history a vice president broke the tie on a Defense Secretary.",
      "Hegseth pushed back on the criticism last week, telling reporters that \"a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out.\"",
      "\"We're changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters,\" Hegseth said. \"And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn't matter.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 15:10:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump's ratings on economy are lower, but his deportation plan keeps majority support.",
    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large eight in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",
      "And on the other side of the aisle, many Democrats describe their feelings about how their party is handling the Trump administration as making them feel frustrated and nervous.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,356\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 23-25, 2025.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Senator President Trump repeated his threat Saturday to look at potential sanctions on Russia. Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted he's got nearly 60 co-sponsors for a sanctions bill. Yet in our interview, Minister Lavrov basically said their economy is self-sufficient and sanctions don't matter. Are they actually leverage at all?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think we ought to take up the Graham legislation, and we ought to pass it through both houses and put those secondary sanctions on Russia. And the fact is I've been watching Minister Lavrov for 16 years since I've been in the Senate, and he is very adept at talking a lot and saying nothing. And in that interview, as we know, he refused to acknowledge Russia's aggression into Ukraine. He refused to acknowledge that it's Russia that's firing on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, not the Ukrainians. He refused to acknowledge the children from Ukraine who have been disappeared into Russia, kidnapped there he he does not. He's a an excellent prevaricator who never takes a position that is in opposition to what he believes is Russia's interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fair summary there as to his abilities to evade direct answers, but he did directly answer on the sanctions bit, saying trying to brush off these threats. Given the vote count, do you think that you could actually get this to be veto proof? That you could force President Trump to put these sanctions on Russia and get congressional leadership to actually allow you to vote in the first place?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well I do, and I think in fact, the administration has been working with Senator Graham, and certainly understands that this is legislation that is in the works and that there is some real benefit as Vladimir Putin continues to drag his feet, to do everything he can to play for more time, so that they're able to take more territory in Ukraine and to better advance Russia's position, this is something that can help slow them down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the oversight roles you have on some of the committees you serve on. At the State Department, Secretary of State Rubio announced a major reorganization this past week with plans to reduce staff by 15%, eventually. It will also condense certain bureaus or eliminate them. One of them is the Office of Global Women's Issues. And I know you have personally worked with many of these diplomats. Can Rubio just eliminate it with the stroke of a pen?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I noticed that one of the things in your polling that people were not happy about was the actions by the administration without oversight and advice and consent from Congress. And this is what this administration is talking about, what Secretary of State Rubio is talking about. They're talking about going in, making these changes without really consulting with Congress. The reason we have an Office of Global Women's Issues is because what we know about foreign policy is that those countries that have women who are empowered are more stable. We know that women give back more to their communities, to their countries, to their families, than men do. And there's a good reason why we have an Office of Global Women's Issues, because it helps us as we think about our foreign policy, and it's been one of the advantages that the United States has had over our adversaries like China and Russia and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And had previously received support from the president's daughter Ivanka Trump, who I know you worked with during that first administration.",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: I worked very closely with Ivanka, and she was very supportive of the Office of Global Women's Issues.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll, watch what happens to it. I need to ask you about Armed Services Committee in which you also serve. A number of political appointees at the Pentagon have been fired or resigned in recent days, which means the Secretary of Defense currently has no chief of staff, no deputy chief of staff, and no senior advisor for policy. Does it concern you that he doesn't have this kind of architecture around him, and what is Congress doing in terms of oversight?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: It concerns me greatly that he he has created chaos at the Pentagon. The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again. He showed it with his sharing classified information on a Signal chat with the recent sharing of information again with his wife, with his brother, with his lawyer, on a Signal chat inappropriate to take classified information and then share it in an unclassified source with people who do not have the credentials to hear that information. He has created chaos that is now embroiling uniform- our uniform military in the chaos that he's creating at the Pentagon without having the appropriate people to run things, and he's not taken responsibility for his actions. And for those people who serve under him, he has shown that he is not the kind of role model, not the kind of leader that we need at this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, it's sensitive information the Pentagon is looking into through this inspector general inquiry, whether it was classified. Do you have any idea when you will get a clear answer?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't, and I think it's important that that's a bipartisan request to have that investigation done to see what was appropriate, and hopefully they will come out soon with recommendations. You know, one of the things the concerns that I raised with the Secretary of Defense was what the tariffs are doing to the supply chain for our Department of Defense, we know that the Ukraine war showed us that we have some real challenges with our defense industrial base. Those are being made worse by these tariffs. I was at a company in New Hampshire last week that does ball bearings for the aerospace industry. They told me that because of the tariffs on steel, that what used to take them 20 weeks to get steel. They're now having a two and a half year backlog that puts a real strain on our Department of Defense.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling some support for the President's policies, here. We know that overall border crossings are at the lowest monthly level we have seen, just over 7000 migrants came across in March and were apprehended, but given the fact that you're still waiting on Congress to give you funding, do you think that's going to handicap your ability to carry out these policies?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, look, I think we've been very successful, and we got we got the most secure border in the history of this nation, and President Trump was able to accomplish that in seven weeks. That's something that Joe Biden didn't- wouldn't do in four years. But yeah, the more money we have, the more we can do. The border's more secure it's ever been in the history of this nation. But we need more funding for interior operations- ICE operations, to arrest those public safety threats, national security threats and others from the United States. Again, the numbers about three times higher than they were during the Biden administration, as far as ICE arrests in the interior, but with more money we can do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about what's happening on the interior. On Friday, there were three American citizen children- born here, who were deported along with their mothers from Louisiana down to Honduras, and according to advocates, one of them is a four year old child with stage four cancer- a rare form of metastatic cancer, who was sent back to Honduras without getting to talk to a doctor and without medication. I understand this child's mother entered this country illegally, but isn't there some basis for compassionate consideration here that should have allowed for more consultation or treatment.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, it certainly is- discretion- I'm not aware of specific case, but no U.S. citizen child was deported. Deported means you got to be ordered reported by an immigration judge. We don't deport U.S. citizens--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The mother was deported along with the children.",
      "TOM HOMAN: These children were- children aren't deported. The mother chose to take the children with her when you enter the country legally, and you know you're here illegally, and you choose to have a U.S. citizen child that's on you. That's not on this administration. If you choose to put your family in that position, that's on them. But having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally. It's not a get out of jail free card. It doesn't make me- make you immune from our laws. If that's the message we sent the entire world, women are gonna keep putting themselves at risk and come to this country. We send a message. You can enter country illegally, which is a crime. That's okay. You can have due process, great taxpayer expense. Get ordered removed. That's okay. Don't leave. But have a U.S. citizen child and you're immune from removal? That's not the way it works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there should be compassionate consideration for a four year old child undergoing treatment for cancer?",
      "TOM HOMAN: I didn't say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that was the question.",
      "TOM HOMAN: I said the ICE officers do have discretion. ICE officers do have discretion. I'm not familiar with the specific case. I don't know what facts around this case. I've just made aware of this when you- when you mentioned this morning. I was not aware of that case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, a federal judge who was appointed by President Trump, said a two year old American citizen child had been sent to Honduras with the mother who was deported. But the judge said, quote, there was no meaningful process. So again, this is another similar situation and dynamic. Shouldn't there be special care when these deportation cases involve small, American born children?",
      "TOM HOMAN: First of all, I disagree with the judge. It was due process. That female had due process at great taxpayer expense, and was ordered by an immigration judge after those hearings, so she had due process. Again, this is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you, or you can decide to leave a child here with a relative or another spouse. Having a U.S. citizen child doesn't make you immune from our laws of the country. American families get separated every day by law enforcement. Thousands of times a day, when a parent gets put in jail, the child can't go with them. These- if you're an illegal alien, come to this country and you decide to have your assistant child that's on you. You put yourself in that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it came to this particular case- you just pointed out that that they could have made arrangements. The father tried, actually, to make arrangements as we understand it, through our reporting, but he and the mother, who were separated- since she was in detention after showing up for her appointment, was only allowed a very brief phone call. The father tried to petition to get the child handed over to an American citizen relative. So the mother had to make this decision and took the child with her. It just seems like there could be some more time frame here around due process allowed. That's what the judge is saying- is saying there should have been more of a process here.",
      "TOM HOMAN: There was due process, the two year baby- the two year old baby was left with the mother because the mother signed the document requesting her two year old baby go with her. That's the parents' decision. I don't- you know, I don't think the judge knows specifics of this case, two year old went with a mom. The mom signed the paper saying, I want my two year old to go with me. That's a- that's a parent's decision. It's not a government decision, it's a parent's decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The father wrote a note. Anyhow, we have to leave it there, director, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the stock market rebound this week, and yet, you see in our polling data, you see in economic indicators that there is real concern about what is coming, even recession predictions. What are you seeing?",
      "COHN: So I think we need to take a step back here. We entered the year with just unbelievable euphoric excitement about what was going to happen. We also entered the year with the market sort of priced for perfection. I think now, as we roll forward to where we are today, we're sort of in a world where we're in a price for realistic uncertainty, and uncertainty is not good for growth. So we've gone from this excitement to unpredictability, and the unpredictability has to do with where are we on the economy. And I think a lot of your data showed there's still a little bit of confusion on the economy right now. What we have seen for the beginning of the last three months, in the early stages of the presidency, is we've seen the consumers starting to be a little bit concerned about tariffs. The concern about tariffs has driven them to preload or front-end buy a lot of the larger items that they were going to buy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Buy them now, because they might be cheaper than in a few months.",
      "COHN: We've seen automobile sales almost all-time record highs. So we see people buying automobiles because they're trying to avoid tariffs. They're buying consumer goods, they're buying washing machines, they're buying technology items. So we've seen the economy actually be in relatively good shape. So if you look at the actual data, what people would call hard data coming out of the economy right now, it looks pretty solid. If you look at the softer data, and the softer data is polling data, and you just showed some polling data, there's an awful lot of economic polling data. You start to see much more weakness in the polling data. So if you look at consumer confidence, consumer confidence is an indication of what I'm thinking I'm going to do going forward, you start to see a lot more weakness in consumer sentiment and in consumer data. And I think that's starting to play through the economy. This week, we started to see a lot of the major companies in America report earnings for the first quarter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "COHN: Now, remember that's backwards looking, the first quarter, but companies also have a view of what's going on in the second quarter. So you started to see some of the major consumer-facing brands say, look, our first quarter was pretty good, but we're starting to see signs the second quarter is not going to be as good as we hoped. We saw it in fast food restaurants like Chipotle. We saw it in snack foods for Pepsi Cola. We saw it in the airlines. The airlines have talked about how difficult their restaurants are, and we've also seen it in the very high-end product. We saw it in LVMH is warning about sales slowing down. So we're in this part of the economy where there's this lack of predictability, there's uncertainty and the consumers acting that way by sort of withdrawing from the market and only buying the essentials and the necessity products or products they think they can buy today because they may be more expensive tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or perhaps not on shelves tomorrow. That's something that we heard some of these retail CEOs privately told the White House in meetings this week. And our Richard Escobedo reports that in a separate meeting, the Treasury Secretary told investors the booking of container ships that carry goods between China and the U.S., it's down more than 60%.",
      "COHN: Well, we're seeing the data. We're seeing the data coming out of China, and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That means if people even want to buy it, it won't be there.",
      "COHN: So what people need to understand is the cycle from a good being sold in China, loaded on a vessel, sailed across the ocean, unloaded in the United States, put in a factory, distributed to a shelf, is about eight weeks in the United States. So if you go back to the April 2nd date when the tariffs kicked in, you're talking about seeing the effect really May 2nd. So I would say the last couple weeks of, of, of, of May you'll start, you'll start seeing this effect here. So you know we're a few weeks away from starting to see the early effects of what will happen in the transportation of goods. You're also starting to see many of the small businesses, and this is where it's really interesting, you know, small businesses who have to order goods, and you saw a lot of data out of the toy industry recently, the toy industry, which is really small industry runs the vast majority of retail toy sales. You know, people are ordering their toys for Christmas today, have to order those toys. Those toys are now coming with a massive 145% tariff. The vast majority of small business toy stores cannot order toys today because they cannot afford the 145% tariff. So they're making a conscientious decision. They're either going out of business or they're just going to wait and see what happens. So you're right, the lag effect of getting goods this country will not be felt for another two to four weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are no active trade negotiations underway, according to the Treasury Secretary. There may be contact between the U.S. and China, but that's not going to be a quick fix.",
      "COHN: That said, the Treasury Secretary did acknowledge this week that the relationship between China and the United States is unsustainable. And I think we have to acknowledge that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He, he said the trade war, right?",
      "COHN: He said, he did say --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He pumped the brakes on that.",
      "COHN: He did. He did. But at the end of the day, the trading issue really has started, for better, to coalesce around the China issue. I think we're all starting to realize that the country we're most dependent upon in the United States and for our shelves and what we would miss the most would be what comes out of China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We knew that. You knew that.",
      "COHN: We've always known that. We've always known that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told President Trump that during the first term.",
      "COHN: We've known it. But the fact that the Treasury Secretary is acknowledging that we are in an unsustainable situation, and we have to start negotiating with the, with the Chinese is very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also have to say we're ready to talk, and they haven't yet. In fact, the Chinese seem to be really holding the line on this so far. But I also want to ask you about what President Trump has said because when you're talking about what's coming down the line, he's indicated that it could be up to the Fed, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates to sort of make up for what happened. He did pull back on his threat to fire the Fed chair. Do you think there is an interest rate cut that's necessary?",
      "COHN: So I think the Fed is doing exactly what they were empowered to do. The Fed is an independent agency with a dual mandate. And their dual mandate, very simply stated, is full employment on one side, and stable prices. And their definition of stable prices is an inflation rate at or around 2%.They are in a position right now where they're basically at full employment, inflation at about 2.4%. So they're basically saying we have done our job right now. So there is, in essence, really no reason for us to take action at this moment. And on top of that, we have this unpredictable economy. We have this potential instability. We know that the Customs Border Patrol is starting to collect more and more tariff money every day. We know that those costs have to feed through the economic system. We predict that that will be inflationary, even if it's just a one time price shock.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "COHN: So there are those that say, look, it is a one time price shock, it's not inflationary. But the one time you move prices up, if you're not moving wages up commensurate with the one time price move, every American is losing purchasing power. So if you have a fixed price wage, but the cost of goods goes up once, you can purchase less.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, the President also says you may pay more here, right, but I got you on the tax cuts. In fact, he tweeted when tariffs cut in, just this morning he said this, many people's income taxes will be reduced or eliminated, and he's going to focus on those making less than $200,000 a year. This is not going to get done by Memorial Day, is it?",
      "COHN: Look, I don't, I don't know. That would be very fast for it to get done. The other thing we need to understand about tariffs, and I think this is obvious, is tariffs are highly regressive. Meaning that poorer people end up paying a disproportionate percentage of the tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "COHN: Because they spend 100% of their paychecks on goods. So they're going to Walmart, they're going to their stores. They're buying goods with their paycheck. Wealthier people send it, save a bigger percentage of their paycheck. So the tariffs are going to affect the poorer people more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We got to leave it there, Gary. We're going to watch this though.",
      "COHN: Okay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov. Good morning, Minister Lavrov, I want to ask you about what happened in Kyiv. There was a large Russian attack on that capital city about one o'clock in the morning. President Trump has said publicly, the Russian strikes are not necessary and very bad timing. \"Vladimir, STOP!\" was his quote. What made it worth killing civilians when Ukraine says it's ready for a ceasefire?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV: We only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military. President Putin expressed this for so many times, and this is not different this time as well. We never consciously target civilian sites unlike- unlike the Zelensky regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So was this an intentional attack, then? Not a mistake?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: If this was a target used by the Ukrainian military, the Minister of Defense, the commanders in the field have the right to attack them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So just to be clear, when the President of the United States says, \"Vladimir, STOP!\" Is this a rejection of that request? Was the assessment that, because of what you say regarding the concerns that this loss of civilian life made it worth it?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, I can assure you that the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian like TV center in Belgrade in 1999- this was an intentional attack against civilian target. In our case, we only target those sites which are used by the military. And regarding the ceasefire and the regarding the call to stop, President Putin immediately supported President Trump's proposal few weeks ago to establish a 30 day ceasefire provided- provided we do not repeat mistakes of the last 10 years, when deals were signed and then Ukraine would violate those deals with the support and with encouragement from Biden administration and from European countries. This was the fate of the deal of February 2014 then the- this was the fate of the Minsk agreements, and this was the fate of the deal reached on the basis of Ukrainian proposals in Istanbul in April 2022. So President Putin said, ceasefire, yes, but we want the guarantees that the ceasefire would not be used again to beef up Ukrainian military and that the support of arms should stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ukraine accepted on March 11, that idea of a U.S. brokered ceasefire without preconditions. You're saying the preconditions are a negotiation to end something else?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: No, it is not a precondition. It is the lessons learned after at least three times the deal's similar to the one which we are discussing now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Russia has not accepted that call for a ceasefire--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: --But Ukrainian regime has a strong support from European capitals and Biden administration. If- if you want a ceasefire, just to continue supply arms to Ukraine, so what is your purpose? You know what- what Kaja Kallas and- what's his name- Mark Rutte said about the- the ceasefire--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The NATO Secretary General and the European Union--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: They bluntly stated that they can support only the deal which, at the end of the day, will make Ukraine stronger, would make Ukraine a victor. So if this is the purpose of the ceasefire, I don't think this is what President Trump wants. This is what Europeans, together with Zelenskyy, want to make out of President Trump's initiative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will Russia continue targeting Kyiv despite President Trump saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\"",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You're not listening to me. We will continue to target the sites used by the military of Ukraine, by some mercenaries from foreign countries and by instructors whom the Europeans officially sent to help target Russian civilian sites. If you- if you take a look at the- at the situation in the Kursk region of Russia, for example, there is no single military target for the last six months which the Ukrainians would- would- would fire at. And there was also a proposal by President Trump immediately support President Putin to have a one month moratorium on that text on energy infrastructure--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right that's expired.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We never violated this- this commitment of President Putin. And Ukrainians violated what Zelensky seemed to support several hundred times and I sent to Marco Rubio and to the United Nations the list of those attacks. It's really very- very telling and eloquent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ukraine disputes that. But putting that aside, I want to ask you about what President Trump said on Wednesday. The President of the United States says he thinks the U.S. and Russia have a deal, let's get it done. Does President Putin agree?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, the President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction. The statement by the president mentions a deal, and we are ready to reach a deal, but there are still some specific points- elements of this deal which need to be fine tuned. And we are busy with this exact process, and the President of the United States did not spell out the elements of the deal, so it is not appropriate for me to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he did say there was a deal, and that he was sending his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to meet with Vladimir Putin Friday in Russia. Is that meeting still happening? And should we expect a deal this week?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, you don't trust the word of the President of the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking your president's word. What will he tell the U.S. envoy?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We- we continue our contacts with the American side on the situation in Ukraine, there are several signs that we are moving in the right direction. First of all, because President Trump is probably the only leader on Earth who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation, when he said- said that it was a huge mistake to pull Ukraine into NATO, and this was a mistake by Biden administration, and he wants to rectify this. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Ukraine is not part of NATO--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- Marco Rubio expressed yesterday, I think, also the assessment that they had the American team now is getting a better understanding of the Russian position and of the root causes of this situation. One of this root causes, apart from NATO and creation of direct military threats to Russia just on our borders, another one is the rights of the national minorities in Ukraine. Everything Russian- media, education, culture, anything was prohibited by a law in Ukraine. And to get out of this, of this crisis, you cannot just forget about human rights. When- whenever we discuss--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It's not illegal to speak Russian--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- Iran- North Korea, anything American negotiators put on top human rights. They have claims in this regard to China, to us, to anybody. But whenever Europeans and other Western nations speak about Ukraine, nobody can mumble the words human rights. Just nobody. On the contrary, what- what Ursula von der Leyen and other people, Brussels and in Europe say that- that Ukraine is defending the European values. So one of these values is canceling the Russian language. Imagine, if--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --It is not illegal, Minister Lavrov, to speak Russian. The President of Ukraine speaks Russian--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- If Israel cancel Arabic language in- in Palestine. Just imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. You mentioned that the US and Russia need to work on some of these fine points of a deal have you--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- Yeah, do you want this to be spelled out?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, of course, I'd love that. But my question was--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: This is not the way we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --European sources say that the US proposal is really just kind of a list of bullet points. Does Russia have details, the details you need at this point in terms of a formal proposal?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We are really polite people, and unlike some others, we never discuss in public what is being discussed in negotiations. Otherwise, negotiations are not serious. To ask for somebody's opinion regarding the substance, go to Zelensky. He is happy to talk to anybody through media, even to President Trump. He presents his- his claims. We are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Well, he said he hasn't received a formal proposal, so I was wondering if you had--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- We are- we are serious people and we consider serious proposals. We make serious proposals, and this is a process which is not supposed to be public until the end of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no deal is imminent?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: I didn't say this. Now- now I understand, by the way, why you wanted to get the brief answers to your questions. You want some slogans to be- to be-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, the president of the United States said there was a deal with Russia. So I wanted to ask Russia if there is a deal with the United States. So, I just want to be clear.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: So, we made our comments on this statement. The- the negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations. We cannot disclose what it is about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. The National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said last month that President Trump is asking for thousands of Ukrainian children who were taken into Russia to be released now as part of what he called confidence building measures. What steps has Russia taken to meet Mr. Trump's request?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, long before the request coming from Washington, we have been addressing the issue of the fate of the kids who during the conflict found themselves outside the- their homes, outside their families. Most of these kids were attending- were attending- what you call it, the place where people without parents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Orphanage.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Orphanage. Orphanage. And as soon as and we announce whatever- whatever details we have about those kids, and as soon as relevance- I mean, the parents or other relevant- relatives make themselves available. They are getting the kids back. This has been the process for the last almost three years between the ombudsman of Russia and Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's no new release of thousands of Ukrainian children at the request of President Trump?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: No, there was the- nobody- nobody knows why- why some experts advise the President about thousands of Ukrainian children. Every now and then, once in two- three months, we organize exchanges with Ukrainians with the help of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, who do not, you know, make any noise about what they're doing. They just do something which we are participating in- in very constructive manner. Bringing kids back to the parents or relatives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what confidence building measure can Russia offer now, particularly after this strike in Kyiv, where the President of the United States is saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\" How do you convince the United States that Russia is actually serious about peace?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, confidence building measures have been plentiful in the last 10 years. I mentioned--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The strike was overnight.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You want a brief answer, right? As I- as I understand from your initial words, or you want an answer which is explaining the situation. The proposal by President Trump on a 30 days moratorium on the strikes against the energy infrastructure was supported by President Putin and observed strictly. This was a confidence building measure against the policy and action taken by Zelenskyy regime. As I said several hundred times, civilian energy infrastructure was trapped. Another confidence building measure was the proposal of President Trump and his team to resume the deal on Black Sea and the delegations met in Istanbul, in Riyadh, the delegations exchanged the views how this can be implemented in practical terms, and the proposals made by Russia are being considered by the United States. There are many other examples about confidence building measure. But if- if you believe that it's only Ukraine who is interested in confidence building, I think a short answer would be, this is an illusion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you take President Trump at his word when he says, if Russia is unable to make a deal on ending the bloodshed in Ukraine he'll put secondary tariffs, I think he means sanctions there, on oil coming out of Russia. Or do you think that at this point, the relationship between Russia and America has been rebuilt and that won't happen?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, I cannot comment on what you think President Trump meant when he said something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think he meant when he said secondary tariffs on oil coming out of Russia?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, we hear many things coming from President Trump. President Trump said that he's sick and tired of the situation in this settlement, especially yesterday when he commented the statements by Zelenskyy. And President Trump has his own proposals and has his own style in mentioning those proposals in his public speeches. We concentrate, as I said, on the real negotiations which President Trump supports and instructed his people to continue to engage in these negotiations. I'm sorry the answer was a bit longish, but it's difficult to explain otherwise.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I ask about the threat of sanctions, or secondary tariffs, because you recently said in an interview, if you had to personally pick sides, you would keep the existing sanctions in place on Russia. You said you've restructured the economy to be self-sufficient, and there is a growing fear that, quote, \"cunning Americans will lift sanctions all of a sudden to flood our market with services and technologies.\" So if that's the case, why should the United States consider lifting sanctions at all?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Why do you ask me? You just quoted my statement, and this statement is clear for me and clear to all those who read it. If you have questions to the American side, how they treat the situation. It is not, it is not the right address to raise it with me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to keep sanctions in place. Is that really the Russian position?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: I don't want to re-explain what I explained, I think, in quite- in quite clear manner. And you quoted, I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I quoted--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: --very close to the real content. Yeah. It was a bit longer than normally you prefer. I know, I know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, back in February, though, one of your colleagues Kirill Dmitriev, who runs the sovereign wealth fund and has been active in the diplomacy with the United States, said something a bit different. That's why I'm asking for clarification. Because he said there is the expectation that American companies would return to the Russian market in the second half of 2025.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, the President of Russia commented upon this situation. He said that we have nothing against American company, but those companies who decided to leave their business in Russia might find that their place has been occupied already by Russian or other foreign investors, and in this case, we would not make any decisions which would discriminate those who came to invest in Russia instead of Americans. If American companies would like to come to a place which is not yet occupied, if they want to- to propose a project, a new project, on top of the previous business ties, of course, we will look into this. And if we found- if we find balance of our interests, I think it would be only natural to get into business together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what areas has the U.S. offered to lift sanctions on, because it wouldn't be possible for an American, many American companies, to enter the Russian market right now, under the existing sanctions.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: It is up to them to decide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no offer has been made?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: No, how can we offer something?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States to Russia?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, the United States clearly tells us that they are interested in doing business together. We never reject business proposals, provided they are based on the equal opportunities and the treatment of each other and lead to a balance of interest. Specific proposals which are being mentioned in the media, I cannot comment upon. This is not serious. We are not- people- we are not acting like the people in Kyiv who talk to the world through the media, including talking to Presidents of great countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if I understand you correctly, you neither fear sanctions nor want them lifted.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, you quoted my statement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: And you quoted it right. That's my- that's my position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so when President Trump threatens new sanctions, that's not of concern?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You're asking this for the third time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, just trying to get--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: This was a brief answer. This was a brief answer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are being brief and direct on that part. I was asking on the sanctions for clarity and directness. Broadly speaking, when you look at what's happening in the battle space in Ukraine right now, analysts say about 18% of Ukrainian territory is under the control of Russian forces. U.S. intelligence says battlefield trends are in Russia's favor. So if that's the case, why should the U.S. believe Russia is serious about ending the war if everything is in your favor?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, we judge by the reaction of our American colleagues to what we tell them, and this is being done during negotiations. They're confidential as any serious negotiation, and they know our position. And they, as- as I quoted Marco Rubio, he publicly said that they- now, they better understand the Russian position and the reasons for what is going on. And he said that nobody in Washington lifted a finger to do the same, to understand- to try to understand Russia during the Biden administration, and- and this- this implies that the dialogue continues, that the dialogue is supported by the United States, and I reiterate that it is supported by- by the Russian Federation, and this dialogue continues.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump said he expects to meet soon with Vladimir Putin. What's an acceptable time and location? Why should they meet?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, the presidents are masters of their own destiny and of their own schedule. I heard President Trump say that he is planning to be somewhere mid-May, and that after that, he would be suggesting some days. I cannot add anything else.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. He said- he was asked about meeting with Vladimir Putin, specifically in Saudi Arabia, and he said, most likely not, that's in mid-May, but shortly thereafter.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You said the same thing as I.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, what are you planning?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: So we read the same newspapers and watch the same channels on TV.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I can't pick up the phone and call Marco Rubio the Secretary of State, like you can. What plans are you making for the two to meet?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, I hope your listeners understand very well that it is not ethical for a foreign minister to prejudge, to presume what presidents might or might not discuss.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think it would be good for the two leaders to meet soon? Do you expect that that's what Envoy Witkoff is negotiating?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We're always- we're always in favor of meeting with people who are ready for a dialogue. President Putin repeated this thousands of times, and when we met- when we met in Riyadh together with President Putin's foreign policy adviser Ushakov, with Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, the American colleagues clearly stated that the U.S. policy is based firmly on U.S. national interests. They understand that the Russian policy, led by President Putin, is also based on Russian national interest, and that it is the responsibility of great powers to make sure that whenever those national interests do not coincide, and this is in most of the cases, this difference should not be allowed to degenerate into confrontation, and that's what dialogue is for. But, they also added that when the national interest of two countries- more countries coincide, it would be stupid to miss an opportunity to translate this coincidence into some material, mutually beneficial projects. And this is absolutely our position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that President Trump is coming up on 100 days in office, and he has made clear his patience is wearing thin with the diplomacy here. Do you expect the U.S. and Russia to continue to talk after these potential peace talks fall apart? I mean, is the rebuilding of the relationship so significant now that you think it could withstand the peace talks--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in Ukraine falling apart.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 First, Russia is always available for a dialogue, so you have to address your question to the American side. Second, you prejudge the current process by saying that eventual collapse of the talks. We concentrate on doing business, not on thinking, you know, failures or victories about anything. Unless you concentrate on the facts, that's what we do, you cannot be serious about what you are doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, President Trump and Secretary Rubio said that the window was closing, that time is running out here. That's not my opinion, that's what they said. I want to ask you a little- Go ahead, sorry.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Wait a second, I just quoted Marco Rubio, who yesterday said about better understanding of the Russian position, so maybe, maybe you missed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, he also said a decision in days needed to be made, and that the U.S. has other things to focus on.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: \u00a0We understand, we understand the impatience, because in- in American culture, you create expectations, and you ignite tension around those expectations. This does not help to do realpolitik. But in our case, as I said, we are always ready for dialogue, ready for negotiations, and we would not, you know, begin by banking on a failure. This would be a characteristic of bad deal makers, inexperienced deal makers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Others in the Russian government have proposed that the U.S. and Russia could work together in the Arctic. Are there specific areas of discussion for cooperating right now?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 You always want me to disclose things--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a public statement.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: --things- things which might be, might be discussed by respective officials of Russia and the United States, by those who are responsible for trade, economic cooperation, investments and so on and so forth. How do you expect a participant of negotiations which are still to reach some kind of specific understanding to disclose details in public. It is not serious.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I'm just- I'm asking what you think the potential is.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: I read- I read- I read President Trump's book, the art to make a deal, and he does not advise to disclose information before- before it's time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Respectfully, President Trump speaks quite a lot about the things he would like to do with Russia and opportunities to work together. I understand you don't want to. On the specific things President Trump has said in public \u2013 one of the things he brought up is that the U.S. could work with Ukraine to operate the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, which is in an area you know, Zaporizhzhia. Russians control it, that area right now. Do you agree with President Trump's public statements that the best security would be for the U.S. and Ukraine to operate that together?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: \u00a0No, we- we never received such an offer and if we do, we will explain that the power station, Zapor- Zaporizhzhia power nuclear power station is run by the Russian Federation state corporation called Rosatom. It is being under monitoring of the IAEA personnel permanently located on the site. And if not for the Ukrainian regular attempts to attack the station and to create a nuclear disaster for Europe and for Ukraine as well, the safety requirements are fully implemented and it is in very good hands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So that's a no?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, I don't think- I don't think any change is conceivable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Okay, because that was in a public statement from the White House to the media.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 We- we, as I said, we did not receive any proposal which would be specific. So, you know, I understand that journalists have to speculate. We cannot speculate on something which is really not being- not being mentioned during the negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Zaporizhzhia is not being negotiated right now?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Shall I said it for the third time?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I'm trying to reconcile public statements, but- I heard you, but I just want to be abundantly clear, because that is also widely reported to be in the U.S. proposal currently on the table.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Why don't you ask me about President Trump's position on Crimea?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You liked what President Trump said about Crimea yesterday, when he said that it had been under Russian control since 2014?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 It's not about- It's not about liking or disliking. It's about the fact that he said the truth and when--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So he said something specific you liked?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 And when Zelensky said that this is absolutely excluded, because Crimea is part of Ukraine according to the constitution. Nobody in in Europe or in- in the States, by the way, reminded him that, apart from territorial issues, the Ukrainian constitution guarantees, I quote, the free development, the use and protection of the Russian and other national minorities language in Ukraine, and they guarantee the development of ethnic cultural, language and religious identity of all peoples and national minorities in Ukraine. This is also in the constitution, but as I mentioned already, and you decided not to- not to go deeper into this topic, nobody in the west even mentions human rights when they demand that Ukraine defeat Russia in the battlefield.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 President Trump said Crimea is not even being discussed right now.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Yes, because this is a done deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You mean Russia occupies and controls and will not negotiate the future of Crimea? Is that what you're saying?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Russia- Russia do not negotiate its own territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So that's one, one specific thing that you do want in the public space. You said everything else that I've asked you about in the US proposal is too sensitive to discuss. Is there any other part of the U.S. proposal that you do like?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, no, no. I only commented what was- what was said publicly, and I also said that normal negotiators, I emphasize this once again, normal negotiate- negotiators do not negotiate by through a microphone. They meet and they discuss, they listen to each other, they try to understand, they try to see where of interest can be reached, and this is how our contacts with the American representatives are organized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Respectfully, you've been in the top levels of Russian diplomacy for 30 years.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: For how many?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For at least 30 years. I mean, you've been in very key diplomatic roles within the top of the Russian diplomatic system for a very, very long time. I don't think any part of this is- is typical or normal to use the word you used. Steve Witkoff is the envoy. Kirill Dmitriev",
      "is Vladimir Putin's envoy here. Do you think it's unfortunate that the international system of diplomacy isn't being used more, and that it's this kind of one on one personal envoy structure?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 You did not express your disappointment that the international system of diplomacy was not used for the entire duration of the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 No, I was asking your- whether you were disappointed--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 You did not- you did not mention that Europeans are really very nervous that they're being marginalized. But I can quote a lot of what Europeans stated. I mentioned already Kaja Kallas and also Von der Leyen, who said any deal must make sure that Ukraine is stronger and that Ukraine is on top of Russia. Look, do you need negotiators who believe in this kind of logic and who don't want to look for honest balance of interest? The bi- the Trump administration is interested in searching for a balance of interest. They sincerely want to understand better the Russian position, and they're getting this understanding, and we understand better the American position through negotiations and meetings and discussions which we take- which we have with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in January, Russia signed a deal with Iran to become a strategic partner. Would Russia be willing to sever that relationship at the request of the U.S. if it meant better relations with America?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: There was never any request like this, and we welcome the process which was initiated between the United States and Iran. We are ready to be helpful if the parties believe this can be the case, and they know this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You were the negotiator back in 2015 on behalf of Russia for that landmark international agreement, the JCPOA. And part of how Russia was helpful was destroying Iran's enriched nuclear material. Is that an offer you would do again?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 We were not involved in destroying Iran's nuclear material--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Disposing--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: The part of- the part of the deal was to move some amount of this material to Russia for keeping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Okay, so not destroying, but keeping. Would you keep Iran's enriched nuclear material that they've made in the past few years? Is that an offer to the U.S.?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We are not putting our nose in the negotiations between two countries, one of which is not Russia. And I said very clearly, I believe, but you wanted a brief answer, I will have to be longer, since it is not probably getting through. We welcome the dialogue between the US and Iran. We would be certainly ready to help, if both parties believe this is going to be useful, and they know that we are ready.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, back then, there were sanctions and pressure at the UN. It's a very different dynamic now. I want to ask you quickly about nuclear weapons, because Russia is such a nuclear powerhouse. According to U.S. intelligence, Russia is developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon which would knock out other satellites and devastate the U.S., if it's used. That's in publicly published material. Does Russia intend to violate past treaties and actually put a nuclear weapon in space?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well before asking this question, you have to check whether this is true or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is what U.S. intelligence says.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: U.S. intelligence. I was listening to President Trump about his views of what is the list of achievements of U.S. intelligence, and I have my own facts on which I- I rely. We have been promoting for many years in the United Nations a resolution prohibiting put- putting any nuclear weapons into outer space. The country which is categorically against it is the United States. At the same time, the United States promotes an approach, according to which they want to prohibit putting- putting conventional weapons in outer space. And they cannot answer the question, \"Does this mean that nuclear weapons, they would be planning to move to the orbit?\" So my answer is very clear: we have been championing in the United Nations a legal prohibition of placing any nuclear weapons in outer space. And the United States, at least during the Biden administration this was the case, they were categorically against it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 It was the Trump administration's intelligence community that published those findings just a few weeks ago. Are you saying the Trump administration's intelligence community findings are incorrect in regard to Russia developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 We- we denied those allegations. We, once again, cannot help repeating, have been promoting for years in the United Nations a treaty, not a declaration, a treaty prohibiting placing weapons in outer space. And the United States is against. I cannot comment about the validity of the intelligence reports. As I told you, we never received any facts which would confirm the allegations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you have any interest in arms control talks with the United States, with the Trump administration?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 It was- it was the United States which broke the proc- the process of strengthening strategic stability. And as- if the United States is willing to get back to this track, we will see what are- what are the conditions under which this might be possible. As long as in the U.S. doctrinal document- doctrinal documents, we are described as \"adversary,\" when the officials in Washington called, some time ago, called us \"enemy.\" So we want to understand what Washington thinks of our relationship and whether Washington is ready for,I would emphasize once again, an equal, mutually respectful dialogue heading to finding a balance of interest. If this is the approach, everything is possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Minister, we are- we are coming up on time. But just, before I let you go, from everything you laid out, I haven't heard from you that Russia is willing to make any concession on anything to date.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, my brief answer is you are wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 What concessions has Russia offered?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Wait a second. Wait a second, please. I have been emphasizing repeatedly, in relation to Ukraine, in relation to strategic relations with the United States, I have been emphasizing our readiness to seek balance of interests. If- if this is not what your station considers readiness for negotiations, then I don't know how to be even less eloquent in trying to be brief in my answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, there have been very clear, specific things said by the Trump administration, such as the vice president saying that the current lines of contact in Ukraine would freeze and end up fairly close to where troops are right now. Do you actually consider that a concession?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 I don't discuss publicly the details of what is being subject of negotiations. I understand that you love rumors, because rumors--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The vice president of the United States said it on camera.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Was it a question?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Oh, well, rumor- rumor. You said it was a rumor. The vice president said it. Perhaps you missed it.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, I said about us, we are not discussing things which are subject to negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Okay. Minister Lavrov, thank you for your time this morning.",

      "The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a routine security check, officials said Saturday.",
      "\"The spouse is not a member of the Coast Guard and was detained by Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a lawful removal order,\" said Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth in a statement confirming Thursday's on-base arrest. \"The Coast Guard works closely with HSI and others to enforce federal laws, including on immigration.\"",
      "The arrest happened on move-in day at the base",
      "According to a U.S. official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017, and she was marked for removal from the United States a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an enforcement incident.",
      "Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of a broader sweep.",
      "The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control center to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem.",
      "Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still being detained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from.",

      "The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot-long cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into U.S. government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station.",

The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has faced criticism over his use of Signal group chats.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon set up a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office that enabled him to check messages on the encrypted messaging app Signal while at the office, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. Two of the sources said the system bypasses standard Defense Department security protocols.",
      "A computer monitor in Hegseth's office was installed to give him remote access to the Signal app and text messages from his personal cellphone, the sources said. Hegseth has used the system to check and respond to those messages at his desk, multiple sources said.",
      "The Associated Press earlier reported that Hegseth has made use of an unsecured internet connection, which is known as a \"dirty line\" among IT and cybersecurity professionals. The connection bypasses security protocols that defend against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.",
      "A Defense Department spokesperson denied there's a \"dirty line,\" and denied there is currently any use of Signal inside Hegseth's office. The spokesperson said there's a physical line running between the computer monitor in the defense secretary's office and his cellphone, which is kept immediately outside his office. The monitor alerts him to messages so that he can step out to check his phone. The official said it's currently set up as a one-way line.",
      "The office suite is a sensitive compartmentalized information facility, or SCIF, where cellphones are prohibited.",
      "Two sources with knowledge of the matter told CBS News that the work-around is a security risk \u2013 it gives Hegseth access to his personal iPhone text messages and Signal chat groups at his desk even though his cellphone isn't physically in the office. It is not on the Defense Department's Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network, known in military parlance as NIPR, they said.",

      "Hegseth, an Army veteran and former Fox News host, has faced criticism this week after it was reported that he shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group that he created, which included his wife as well as his brother and personal attorney, who both have positions at the Pentagon but are not in positions that have a clear need to know that sensitive information. It was the second Signal group chat where Hegseth shared the information.",
      "An aide in Hegseth's office, Marine Col. Ricky Buria, helped organize the effort to fix some internet connectivity issues in Hegseth's office in the first days of the administration, two of the sources said. Buria had some oversight over the work to set up the Signal work-around, the sources said.",

    "story": [
      "The FBI on Friday arrested a Wisconsin county judge on obstruction charges, accusing her of preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan \"intentionally misdirected federal agents away\" from an immigrant who is in the U.S. illegally and was set to be arrested.",
      "Patel said that the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, was later arrested and is currently being detained.",
      "Dugan was arrested at 8 a.m. on Friday at the courthouse where she works, according to a federal law enforcement source. She was charged with two counts of obstruction and released from detention after making an initial appearance in federal court.",
      "According to a sworn statement by an FBI agent, Flores-Ruiz was deported from the United States in 2013 and illegally reentered the U.S. During this period, Flores-Ruiz was accused of committing battery.",
      "After a fingerprint match from Flores-Ruiz's first arrest in 2013 and a local case in Milwaukee, a warrant for his arrest and deportation was issued by ICE.",
      "While Flores-Ruiz was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a criminal court appearance, law enforcement waited outside of her courtroom to arrest him on an administrative warrant.",
      "The FBI agent said in the statement that \"arrest team members reported that while waiting outside of the courtroom, a woman approached and took photos of arrest team members,\" just before Flores-Ruiz arrived at the court with his attorney.",
      "A courtroom deputy told the FBI agent that the woman who took the photos of the arrest team showed the pictures to Judge Dugan while she was on the bench in her courtroom, and \"Dugan became visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers.\"",
      "Judge Dugan then approached the arrest team with another judge in the public hallway.",
      "\"Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,\" the agent wrote. Dugan, according to witnesses, told the arrest team to go to the chief judge's office to speak with them about the permissibility of making the arrest inside the courthouse, and looked around the hallway near her courtroom to seek out other law enforcement officers who were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz.",
      "One agent, who Dugan did not recognize as part of the arrest team, remained in the hallway waiting for Flores-Ruiz.",
      "After that, the special agent said multiple witnesses in Dugan's courtroom saw her say, \"Wait, come with me,\" to Flores-Ruiz as he headed toward the public courtroom exit where the officers were waiting.",
      "\"Judge Dugan then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the 'jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse,\" the agent wrote, adding that Dugan also instructed the man's attorney to also leave the courtroom through that door.",
      "Agents later spotted Flores-Ruiz \"looking around the hallway,\" in the courthouse and followed him out of the courthouse, where a foot chase ensued and he was arrested.",
      "Dugan's arraignment is set for May 15.",
      "Prior to Dugan's arrest, President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, told CBS News in an interview that interference with deportations is considered \"evading arrest.\"",
      "\"So we got a lot of, in my opinion, some radical judges who are trying to stop what we're doing,\" Homan said. \"Then you got, you know, NGOs out there, and you got congressional representatives like AOC (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and the rest of 'the Squad,' saying they're going to educate people to their constitutional rights on not opening the door for others.\"",
      "Homan went on: \"We all know that it's about evading arrest. Don't open your door when ICE comes to your door. You have an order of deportation issued by a federal judge. If you and I ignored that order, we'd be in jail. But you've got members of Congress out there saying, 'You don't have to open the door for ICE, they need a warrant. You don't have to talk to ICE.' It's just, we all know what the end game is. The end game is, yeah, you can call it educating constitutional rights. Don't disagree. But we all know what the end game is: evade arrest, put off the arrest. So, that is hurting. But real soon, people are going to see that that's no longer going to work.\"",
      "When questioned about the issue of due process for immigrants, Homan responded, \"They get due process, everyone gets due process.\"",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called the arrest a \"gravely serious and drastic move\" in a statement on social media. \"While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President's lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress's checks on his power,\" Baldwin said.",
      "Who is Hannah Dugan, the judge arrested by the FBI?",
      "Dugan has served as a judge in Milwaukee County Circuit Court since 2016, when she was elected with about 65% of the vote. She was later reelected in 2022 after running unopposed.",
      "A 1987 graduate of the University of Wisconsin Law School, Dugan worked as a civil law attorney before joining the bench, according to her LinkedIn page. She described some of her specialties as \"disability, Social Security, elder, and veterans' law.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism.",
      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",
      "\"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said.",
      "The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meeting earlier this month.",
      "Bhattacharya told reporters earlier this week that he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than the initial timeline outlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said.",

    "story": [
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday that the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine, though he also said some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",
      "\"The President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said in an interview Thursday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Lavrov declined to say what is being discussed in negotiations or whether any deal was imminent. He said the negotiations are \"not supposed to be public.\"",
      "\"The negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations, we cannot disclose what it is about,\" Lavrov said.",
      "The comments came after Russia struck Kyiv overnight Thursday, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 70, in the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital in months as President Trump pushes a proposal for an end to the war.",
      "Asked by Brennan what made it worth killing civilians after Ukraine had said in March that it's ready for a ceasefire, Lavrov said \"we only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military,\" adding that \"President Putin expressed this for so many times, and this is not different this time as well.\"",
      "Lavrov suggested that the attack was intentional, arguing that \"if this was a target used by the Ukrainian military,\" then the minister of defense and commanders in the field \"have the right to attack them.\"",
      "Still, on the talks with Ukraine, there are \"several signs that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said. Among them, he cited Mr. Trump as \"probably the only leader on Earth who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump issued a rare rebuke of the Russian president in a post on Truth Social Thursday morning, saying he's \"not happy\" with the Kyiv strikes, while noting that they took place as he worked to reach a peace deal. It was \"very bad timing,\" he said and addressed Putin, saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\"",
      "Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after first sending troops into eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia has claimed its offensive invasion was provoked by Ukraine and the West, an assertion that has been rejected by the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he believes Russia wants peace and continues to publicly criticize Ukraine's democratically elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in spite of Ukraine's acceptance of his proposed 30-day ceasefire. And along the campaign trail, he pledged to negotiate an end to the war in a day. But almost 100 days into his administration, an agreement eludes him.",
      "On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance warned that Russia and Ukraine must reach a peace deal, as envoys from the U.K., France, the U.S, Ukraine and Germany met in London. Vance said the White House has \"issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process.\"",
      "Vance said the window for diplomacy was closing, and the U.S. envisions a freeze of military conflict more or less along existing lines. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that Russia holds roughly 18% of Ukrainian territory. In the meantime, U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in London with European allies and Ukraine on Wednesday. European partners are concerned that the U.S. position is focused on pressuring Ukraine, which is the victim of the Russian invasion, and not extracting any concessions to date from the aggressor.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the conflict by saying he wouldn't accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement. Crimea, located in Ukraine's southern peninsula, has been occupied by Russia since 2014.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post that the U.S. had not asked Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, though he also said, \"Crimea was lost years ago,\" while Barack Obama was president. Mr. Trump said the parties are \"very close to a Deal, but the man with 'no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon that \"we're putting a lot of pressure on Russia,\" although it was unclear what pressure he was referencing. The U.S. has not placed new sanctions on Russia, and the president has argued he considers it a concession by Putin that he has not seized Ukraine in its entirety. Mr. Trump reiterated that he thinks Russia \"wants to make a deal,\" but \"it takes two to tango.\"",
      "\"You have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too, and they're being hit very hard, and I do believe they want to make a deal,\" the president said.",
      "Zelenskyy reposted on social media a 2018 statement by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Crimea that said, \"the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.\"",
      "That policy of arming Ukraine, and rejecting Russia's seizure of territory by force seems to have changed during the second Trump administration.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joined the president Thursday at the bilateral meeting with Norway's prime minister in the Oval Office, added that \"this war is endable,\" citing a \"great meeting\" on Wednesday, and meetings to come over the weekend.",
      "\"We've shown them the finish line, we need both of them to say yes,\" Rubio said. \"But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end.\"",

      "That immigration court case in Louisiana is progressing alongside a lawsuit in federal district court in New Jersey challenging the legality of Khalil's detention. Lawyers in that case have asked the federal judge overseeing it to order Khalil's release, revoke Rubio's determination and bar the government from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday agreed to block portions of President Trump's executive order that seeks to overhaul U.S. elections, including a provision that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly agreed to partially grant a preliminary injunction sought by three different groups of plaintiffs, including voting rights groups and the Democratic Party, finding that they are likely to prevail in their challenge.",
      "The judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing two provisions of the executive order signed by the president last month: the first orders the Election Assistance Commission, a federal independent regulatory commission, to add a \"documentary proof of U.S. citizenship\" requirement to the standardized national voter registration form; and the second ordered federal voter registration agencies to \"assess\" citizenship before providing a federal voter registration form to people who receive public assistance.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said that the president generally does not have the power to regulate federal elections.",
      "\"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states \u2014not the president \u2014 with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote in a 120-page opinion. \"Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the president purports to order. And no statutory delegation of authority to the executive branch permits the president to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said, \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we're confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's directive follows years of unfounded claims raised by him and his allies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, allegations the president has continued to amplify during his second term in the White House. The order claims that the U.S. \"now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing.\"",
      "\"Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,\" the executive order states.",
      "While Congress has the power to decide how federal elections are run, and has done so through laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, the Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" of holding elections.",
      "In addition to the now-blocked citizenship-related requirements, the president's executive order seeks to give the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and states access to certain databases to identify any noncitizens who are registered to vote; orders the attorney general to enforce two laws against states that include absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in the final tally of votes for president and Congress; and orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funds on states adopting Election Day as the deadline for receiving ballots.",
      "Those provisions were at the center of the lawsuits filed by a slew of voting rights groups and arms of the Democratic Party, including the Democratic National Committee and the party's congressional leaders. They argued that the president did not have the power to issue those changes and could not make them unilaterally.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge to two sections of the order, requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form and requiring people enrolled in public assistance programs to have their citizenship assessed before getting the federal voter registration form.",
      "But she declined to stop the Trump administration from implementing the other parts of the president's order as the litigation moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "As to the proof-of-citizenship requirement, Kollar-Kotelly wrote neither the Constitution nor federal voter registration law gives the president the authority to direct the Election Assistance Commission to change what is on the federal registration form.",
      "\"The president is free to state his views about what policies he believes that Congress, the EAC, or other federal agencies should consider or adopt. But in this case, the president has done much more than state his views: He has issued an 'order' directing that an independent commission 'shall' act to 'require' changes to an important document, the contents of which Congress has tightly regulated,\" the judge wrote. \"That command exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "On the second provision that Kollar-Kotelly blocked, she said people applying for public assistance programs are entitled to the federal voter registration form, not recipients who have complied with the identification requirements imposed by the programs.",
      "She said provisions of the National Voter Registration Act \"make clear that voter registration agencies' only role in enforcing states' citizenship requirement for voting is to provide the federal form to the applicant, who must then self-certify citizenship by signing the application 'under penalty of perjury.' The statute leaves no role for agencies to 'assess citizenship,' and the president lacks any lawful authority to contravene the NVRA by requiring agencies to do so.\"",
      "Roman Palomares, national president of the voting rights group LULAC, cheered Kollar-Kotelly's decision as a victory for voters and democracy.",
      "\"Efforts to silence the voice and votes of the U.S. electorate must not stand because our democracy depends on all voters feeling confident that they can vote freely and that their vote will be counted accurately,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and co-counsel partners, which are representing the League of Women Voters, said in a joint statement that the judge's decision provides protections for eligible voters, many of which do not have easy access to a passport or other citizenship documents.",
      "\"The president's attempted takeover of federal elections is a blatant overreach to seize power that doesn't belong to him. Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the U.S. Congress and states,\" they said. \"The president lacks authority to rewrite the country's election rules on his own by weaponizing an independent, bipartisan commission to harm eligible voters. The order should ultimately be struck down.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty, appointed by former President Barack Obama, found that actions by the Trump administration and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to withhold funds would \"cripple the operations of many educational institutions,\" and are a violation of executive branch power in overseeing local school districts.",

      "The suit was filed after the Trump administration demanded that all 50 states agree that their public schools would not participate in programs that violate the Trump administration's definition of violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",
      "In a February letter to states, the Education Department asserted that U.S. public schools have embraced \"pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences,\" that \"emanated throughout every facet of academia,\" including schools engaging with the \"false premise that the United State is built upon 'systemic and structural racism.'\"",
      "The letter instructed schools to ensure that their policies \"comply with existing civil rights laws,\" or risk potentially losing billions in Title I money that helps low-income students across the country.",
      "If the Trump administration succeeded with its attempts to keep diversity efforts out of schools, McCafferty wrote that public schools would likely eliminate teaching roles that involve race or censor teachers who teach about race.",
      "\"Would the Department conclude that a history teacher leading a class discussion on the economic development of the antebellum south has violated Title VI? What about an English teacher assigning students to write a paper comparing the persecution of Tom Robinson\u2014whom Atticus Finch championed in To Kill a Mockingbird\u2014to that of Emmett Till? And how would such lessons even relate to a \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" program?\" McCafferty wrote in her opinion. \"These are not hypotheticals. School teachers throughout the country are asking themselves these and similar questions in the wake of the 2025 Letter.\"",
      "McCafferty also found that the Trump administration's definition of diversity, equity and inclusion as unlawful is \"in stark contrast to the dictionary definition of DEI\" and \"inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\"",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement to reporters that \"today's ruling allows educators and schools to continue to be guided by what's best for students, not by the threat of illegal restrictions and punishment.\"",

      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail.

      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973.

Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "A new carnivorous caterpillar that wears the remains of its prey has been dubbed the \"bone collector.\"",
      "The insect is only found on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It creeps along spiderwebs, feeding on trapped insects and adorning its silk case with their body parts.",
      "In findings,\u00a0published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers said the caterpillar \"boasts an unprecedented and macabre practice of decorating its portable larval home with the body parts of the spider prey it harvests from the web where it resides.\"",
      "There are other meat-eating caterpillars that \"do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake,\" said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",
      "Scientists think the case might act as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feast on the spider's ensnared meals without getting caught.",

      "\"I think the term is out there in the ether, and just fit with what these caterpillars are doing. It's a bit tongue in cheek because arthropods don't actually have bones,\" Rubinoff told\u00a0the Reuters news agency.",
      "A host of caterpillars native to Hawaii use silk glands to spin protective cases studded with lichen, sand and other materials. This one is the first to use ant heads and fly wings.",
      "\"It really is an astonishing type of case,\" said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing.",
      "Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare and the bone collectors found in Hawaii will even eat each other, researchers said.",
      "The bone collector's origins date back at least 6 million years, making the caterpillars more than one million years older than the Hawaiian islands themselves. Today, they dwell on an isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species.",
      "The spider \"is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of O\u02bbahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands,\" the scientists wrote.",
      "Scientists urged conservation efforts to save the unique lineage.",

      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",

      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",

      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",

      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Cory Booker voiced their opposition to the Republican budget plan key to enacting President Trump's agenda as the sun rose on Sunday, holding a sit-in protest on the steps of the Capitol that lasted more than 12 hours.",
      "Shortly after 6 a.m., the pair began livestreaming their conversation, while Booker warned of a \"moment of moral urgency\" as Congress is set to return from a two-week recess on Monday. The New Jersey Democrat had pledged to sit and discuss the coming fight for \"a good number of hours,\" a promise he kept by remaining on the steps for more than half a day.",
      "Booker noted the protest had gotten approximately 6 million views online through various platforms as of Sunday evening. The sit-in came less than a month after Booker delivered a record-breaking\u00a025-hour speech\u00a0on the Senate floor to protest the Trump administration's policies.",
      "Congressional committees are set to begin work this week on the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's first-year agenda, after both the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution that serves as a blueprint before leaving town for recess. The plan is a key step toward implementing Mr. Trump's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes, and GOP leaders in Congress have circled an ambitious goal of getting it to the president's desk by Memorial Day.",
      "Republicans are pursuing the plan under the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power the ability to approve major legislation without working across the aisle. Meanwhile, Democrats have vehemently opposed the plan, pushing back chiefly against potential cuts to Medicaid.",
      "\"As we prepare to come back into session tomorrow, this is a time to choose,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said as the conversation kicked off early Sunday. \"And we're either going to choose the side of the American people, or we're going to choose this cruel budget that Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people.\"",
      "Jeffries and Booker were joined by other lawmakers throughout the conversation, including Sens.

Andre Carson of Indiana and Maxwell Frost of Florida, along with advocates, leaders and passersby.",
      "Additional lawmakers who joined in the concluding hours of the sit-in included Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Reps.

      "\"We can't keep doing things like business as usual. We have to think of creative, new things to do,\" Booker said. \"So Hakeem and I thought, let's sit on the steps of the Capitol, open up a live feed right before the sun rises, and begin a conversation.\"",
      "In the early part of the sit-in, the conversation ranged from the budget plan to more broad opposition to the Trump administration, along with personal stories that centered on faith. Later in the day, Booker and Jeffries also handed the microphone to people who spoke about the impact they say Medicaid has had on their families' lives, while they urged lawmakers to protect their benefits.",

    "summary": "Columbus Day, the second Monday in October, was also recognized as Indigenous Peoples Day during former President Joe Biden's term in 2021.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump made clear Sunday that he would not follow his predecessor's practice of recognizing\u00a0Indigenous Peoples Day\u00a0alongside Columbus Day in October, accusing Democrats of denigrating the explorer's legacy as he pressed his campaign to restore\u00a0what he argues are traditional American icons.",
      "Democrat Joe Biden was the\u00a0first president\u00a0to mark Indigenous Peoples Day, issuing a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0in 2021 that celebrated \"the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples\" and recognize \"their inherent sovereignty.\"",
      "The proclamation noted that America \"was conceived on a promise of equality and opportunity for all people\" but that promise \"we have never fully lived up to. That is especially true when it comes to upholding the rights and dignity of the Indigenous people who were here long before colonization of the Americas began.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday used a social media post to declare, \"I'm bringing Columbus Day back from the ashes.\" He said on his Truth Social site that \"the Democrats did everything possible to destroy Christopher Columbus, his reputation, and all of the Italians that love him so much.\"",
      "He said he is \"hereby reinstating Columbus Day under the same rules, dates, and locations, as it has had for all of the many decades before!\"",
      "The federal holiday, the second Monday in October, was still known as Columbus Day during Biden's term, but also as Indigenous Peoples Day. It remained a federal holiday and the former president didn't make any changes as to how or when Columbus Day is recognized in his proclamation, in which he directed\u00a0the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings \"in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.\"",
      "Biden's recognition had been a longtime goal of activists who wanted to shift the focus from commemorating Columbus' navigation to the Americas to his and his successors' exploitation of the indigenous people he encountered there.",
      "Several years before Biden's proclamation, some states and local governments \u00a0\u2014 including\u00a0Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and Austin, Texas \u2014 had opted to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day over Columbus Day as a way of recognizing victims of colonialism. New York is among many places that acknowlodge both names of the federal holiday, with Gov. Kathy Hocul first recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day in 2021 while New York City continues to hold the largest Columbus Day parade in the country.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has long objected to telling the country's history through a lens of diversity and oppression, the holiday he seeks to restore to its primacy was added to the calendar as a nod to the country's growing diversity.",
      "Columbus' expeditions never touched the North American continent, let alone any land that is now part of the United States. But the native of Genoa became increasingly commemorated in the United States as Italian immigrants flocked to the country and politicians sought to win their support.",
      "Indeed, it was the lynching of 11 Italian-American immigrants in New Orleans in 1891 that led to the first Columbus Day celebration in the United States, led the following year by President Benjamin Harrison.\u00a0President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u00a0designated Columbus Day as a national holiday in 1934.",
      "Mr. Trump has long complained about Democrats tearing down statues of Columbus, a complaint he made again in Sunday's post. In 2017, he spoke out against a review of the 76-foot-tall statue of the explorer in New York's Columbus Circle that then-Mayor Bill de Blasio had ordered. It remains in place today, but other statues have been defaced or torn down.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration paid to restore a Columbus statue in Baltimore that was dumped in the harbor during protests against the police murder of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0in Minneapolis. Dozens of other Columbus statues across the country were taken down or in the process of being removed, and many of them were vandalized after the renewed Black Lives Matter protests began.",

      "\"The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again,\" Shaheen said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Hegseth, a 44-year-old Army veteran and former Fox News host, faced scrutiny during the confirmation process early this year, becoming among President Trump's most embattled picks for top posts in his administration. The Senate ultimately approved his confirmation in a narrow vote. But in recent weeks, he's faced renewed scrutiny over the use of the encrypted messaging app Signal.",
      "Last week, reports circulated that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group, which included his wife, his brother and personal attorney. It was the second Signal group chat where Hegseth shared the information, after it was revealed last month a journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat where the timing and targets of the attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared.",
      "CBS News reported Friday that the Pentagon set up a system in Hegseth's office that enabled him to check messages on Signal while at the office. Two of the sources said the system bypasses standard Defense Department security protocols. A Defense Department spokesperson denied there is currently any use of Signal inside Hegseth's office.",
      "Meanwhile, a number of political appointees have resigned or been fired at the Pentagon in recent days, leaving Hegseth without some key staff.",
      "Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued that Hegseth has shown he isn't qualified for the role by sharing the information over Signal and by not having appropriate staff to support him, accusing him of creating \"chaos that is now embroiling our uniform military.\" She added that he has \"not taken responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "\"For those people who serve under him, he has shown that he is not the kind of role model, not the kind of leader that we need at this time,\" Shaheen said.",
      "In response to Shaheen's comments, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell instead pointed to the previous administration. Parnell cited \"Chaos at the Pentagon\" as evidenced by the Afghanistan withdrawal and \"a divisive DEl culture that destroyed service member morale.\" He also pointed to a \"weak leadership\" that he said led to Russia invading Ukraine, Hamas attacking Israel, and Houthi rebels shooting at U.S. ships, along with the \"the invasion of our U.S. southern border by transnational criminal gangs.\"",
      "\"During all this very real chaos, not a single person was fired or held accountable and Sen. Shaheen stayed silent,\" Parnell said. \"Secretary Hegseth is bringing accountability and warfighting back to the Pentagon. The American people care about results \u2014 so far SecDef gets an A+.\"",
      "In March, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, announced a bipartisan request for an expedited watchdog investigation into the Signal chat leak. Shaheen said it's \"important\" that the request was bipartisan, adding that she's hopeful \"they will come out soon with recommendations.\"",
      "The GOP-led Senate Armed Forces Committee advanced Hegseth's appointment in January, and Shaheen was joined by all fellow Democrats on the committee in voting against advancing him. Vice President JD Vance had to break the tie to confirm Hegseth, the first time in history a vice president broke the tie on a Defense Secretary.",
      "Hegseth pushed back on the criticism last week, telling reporters that \"a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out.\"",
      "\"We're changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters,\" Hegseth said. \"And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn't matter.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's ratings on economy are lower, but his deportation plan keeps majority support.",
    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",

      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",
      "And on the other side of the aisle, many Democrats describe their feelings about how their party is handling the Trump administration as making them feel frustrated and nervous.",

      "The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a routine security check, officials said Saturday.",
      "\"The spouse is not a member of the Coast Guard and was detained by Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a lawful removal order,\" said Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth in a statement confirming Thursday's on-base arrest. \"The Coast Guard works closely with HSI and others to enforce federal laws, including on immigration.\"",
      "The arrest happened on move-in day at the base",
      "According to a U.S. official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017, and she was marked for removal from the United States a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an enforcement incident.",
      "Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of a broader sweep.",
      "The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control center to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem.",
      "Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still being detained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from.",
      "The Coast Guard referred questions about the woman's identity, immigration status and charges to ICE, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot-long cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into U.S. government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station.",
      "An online database that tracks ship movements shows the Mohawk has been docked in its home port since mid-March. A March 16 media release says the ship had recently returned following a 70-day deployment to the Eastern Pacific Ocean on a mission to intercept shipments of illegal drugs.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty years ago, when the city of Saigon fell and the U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia came to an end, President Gerald Ford faced a choice: Many anti-communist South Vietnamese feared forced relocation and political persecution at home, and looked to America for refuge. But the American public was bitterly divided over whether to accept such a large influx of refugees. At the time, Lesley Stahl reported on the \"overwhelmingly hostile\" mail received on Capitol Hill about the issue; one letter, from a Nebraska constituent, read, \"They bring only disease, corruption, and apathy.\"",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate sat at nearly 9 percent, a post-World War II high. To many, bringing destitute Vietnamese to American shores seemed nonsensical.",
      "But President Ford saw the issue in stark moral terms: \"There are tens of thousands of other South Vietnamese intellectuals, professors, teachers, editors, and opinion leaders who have supported the South Vietnamese cause and the alliance with the United States, to whom we have a profound moral obligation,\" he said.",
      "Ford ordered several airlifts to extract 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees and asylum-seekers. He signed into law a bill securing relocation aid and financial assistance.",
      "And he corralled a coalition of religious groups, southern Democratic governors, and labor leaders to secure their housing and employment.",
      "At first, many of the new refugees relied on public assistance and took low-paying jobs. But in the years that followed, most gained employment, and their reliance on government aid declined. They became small business owners and pillars of community \u2026 contributors large and small to the American tapestry. Among them: federal judges, a Pulitzer-winning novelist, and even an Oscar-winning actor.",
      "\"My journey started on a boat,\" said \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" star Ke Huy Quan. \"I spent a year in a refugee camp, and somehow I ended up here, on Hollywood's biggest stage.\"",
      "Ford's decision to welcome these refugees wasn't just the right thing to do \u2013 it was smart. He realized that in a nation of immigrants like ours, strength derives in large part from diversity. His leadership showed compassion, political courage, and moral clarity \u2026 qualities our leaders could use today more than ever.",

Both Melody and Scott allowed investigators to test their hands for accelerants. The tests came back negative. Scott also told the detectives something intriguing: he had recently seen a pistol in the basement that was now missing.",
      "Scott Farris: It was just very odd.",
      "And another thing Scott found odd was that his mom had his dad's wallet.",
      "Scott Farris: And I said, \"where'd you find that?\" And she said, well, it's in the console of his car. And I found that very, very odd 'cause my dad never left his wallet in his car.",
      "As Hayes' investigation continued, he was learning all about the Farris family's dysfunctional dynamic \u2013 which came to be known as the \"Farris Wheel.\" In a tape-recorded conversation with Melody, she told the detective there had been tension between Gary and Scott.",
      "MELODY FARRIS (police interview audio): He and Scott would get into it pretty heavily. I mean, you know, and they'd come blows just over things because Gary was so anal about everything. I mean, Scott's hot. \u2026 I mean he is \u2014 he's hot tempered.",

The same type found lodged in Gary's rib bone from the burn pile.",

I do not need to know that.\"",

      "Peter Van Sant: How could each of these vehicles have been used to get Gary's body onto that pile?",
      "Det. Daniel Hayes: Uh, both were capable of pulling a lot of weight. This tractor has a bucket on the front that is designed to scoop heavy loads.",
      "Det. Daniel Hayes: We found tractor marks. But there were tractor marks all over the property, but there were none necessarily obviously leading right up to the burn pile.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What did you find as your forensic people took a look at these vehicles?",
      "Det. Daniel Hayes: Uh, we found blood, evidence of blood on the vehicles.",

      "Det. Daniel Hayes: I can. So on the tractor, we found blood evidence in this area (points to the step).",
      "Gary's blood. But nothing was found in the front bucket. On the RTV, Hayes says, Melody's blood was found on one of the gear shifters; nothing was found in the back. Hayes considered other scenarios.",

      "When the charred remains of prominent commercial real estate attorney Gary Farris were discovered on a burn pile with a bullet lodged in a rib bone, detectives knew they were facing a homicide investigation. The crime scene was on a sprawling 10-acre property in Cherokee County, Georgia, where Gary Farris lived with his wife Melody and their son Scott.",
      "It was July 2018 when detectives found Gary Farris' blood and a second bullet in the basement of the home and questioned how his body could have ended up on the burn pile, about 50 yards away. Soon after their arrival on scene, investigators found themselves entangled in a family drama with mother and son pointing the finger at each other.",

      "Investigators learned Scott Farris was responsible for the day-to-day operations on the farm and that his work and personal expenses were covered by his father. According to Melody Farris, around the time of Gary Farris' death there was tension between him and Scott Farris, mainly about Scott needing to get another job. Scott Farris, however, says that is not true and tension in the home was caused by Melody Farris disappearing for weeks at a time and spending Gary Farris' money.",
      "Gary Farris was the sole bread winner and allowed Melody and Scott Farris access to accounts in his name. Scott Farris said his mother was away for extended periods of time because she was having an affair with her lover who lived in Tennessee.",
      "In June 2019, after an almost 12-month investigation, Melody Farris was arrested for the murder of Gary Farris.",
      "When her trial began in October 2024, her defense team said she was innocent and pointed the finger at Scott Farris. They said at his size, about 6 feet 8 inches, 280 pounds, he was more capable of moving Gary's 6-foot-4-inch, 300-pound body than his much smaller mother.",
      "But police and prosecutors believed Melody Farris was the murderer. Prosecutors argued, among other things, that Melody Farris was the only one home at the time they believe Gary Farris was killed. And at trial they called a witness from the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office Intelligence Division who analyzed phone records and discovered that Gary Farris' cellphone moved from the house to the burn pile and back to the house after investigators believe his body was already on the burn pile. Melody Farris was the only one home at that time as well.",
      "On Nov. 4, 2024, Melody Farris was found guilty of murdering her husband. She had not spoken publicly until her sentencing hearing a month later when she shocked the courtroom, saying, \"Not only did I not do this, I know who did. I know Scott killed his father.\"",
      "Immediately after Melody Farris was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years, she walked into an exclusive interview with Van Sant, where she continued to profess her innocence.",

      "When Massachusetts State Police detectives responded to a reported suicide in Westfield, Massachusetts, on May 8, 2018, they found Amy Fanion dead on her dining room floor with a gunshot wound to her head. Her husband, Brian Fanion, a Westfield Police detective, had called 911, reporting that Amy Fanion had shot herself.",
      "At the scene, detectives made several discoveries that raised questions. The gun used in the shooting was Brian Fanion's service weapon. And there was a lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head, which was unusual in a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What had happened in that dining room that morning? \"48 Hours\" contributor Nikki Battiste takes a look at the evidence in an encore of \u00a0\"The Detective's Wife\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount +.",
      "Detective Brendan O'Toole took Brian Fanion to the State Police barracks in Russell, Massachusetts, to get his statement of the events surrounding his wife's sudden death. At the end of the interview, \u00a0O'Toole asked Fanion to turn over his phone for data extraction. Fanion complied but gave a caveat.",
      "\"I turned off the recorder and that's when Brian told me \u2026 'you're going to see some things on there and it's not what it appears to be,'\" O'Toole told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Investigators would discover thousands of deleted text messages between Brian Fanion and a woman named Corrine Knowles, known as Cori. Brian Fanion had told O'Toole he and Knowles were just friends, but the text messages conveyed that the relationship had become something more.",
      "On May 17, three days after Amy Fanion's wake, O'Toole and Detective Mike Blanchette confronted Brian Fanion about his relationship with Knowles as well as the lack of gunshot residue found on Amy Fanion's wound.",
      "\"I mean, there's no doubt she was shot \u2026 but the question is, from what distance,\" O'Toole asked Fanion.",
      "Within a week, investigators seized all of Fanion's electronics, including his office computer and laptop at the Westfield Police Department. When Detective Tom Forest from the Cyber Crime Unit examined the computer's hard drive, it revealed peculiar web searches and online activity he considered notable to the investigation. The online activity began about three months before Amy Fanion's death, around the time Brian Fanion and Knowles' friendship turned flirtatious.",
      "\"\u2026 it's only when this affair starts up \u2026 that all of these incriminating searches start to appear,\" Hampden County Assistant District Attorney Mary Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The first of these inquiries was related to common household poisons. On the morning of Feb. 12, Brian Fanion searched \"household poisons,\" \"dangerous sources of radiation,\" \"worst sources of radiation\" and \"common prescription overdoses.\" He also visited web pages titled, \"9 Surprising Sources of Radiation in Your Home;\" \"Carbon Monoxide: The Invisible Killer;\" \"Common and dangerous poisons;\" \"16 Common Household Items That Could Kill You;\" \"What Over-the-Counter Medications Can You Overdose From?;\" \"Which Drug Causes the Most Deaths Each Year?\" and, finally, \"Prescription Drugs Linked to Most Fatal Overdoses.\"",
      "At trial, Brian Fanion's defense attorney Jeffrey Brown argued that the Fanions were preparing to have a young niece stay with them and that some of the websites were related to potential hazards their 200-year-old house might pose.",
      "At the beginning of March 2018, Fanion repeatedly Googled his potential lover, Cori Knowles. On April 2, as things heated up between Fanion and Knowles, he began questioning the nuances of affairs, searching \"can you have an affair without sex.\"",
      "Two weeks later, on April 17, Fanion began researching divorce laws in Massachusetts. Several web pages he visited were related to pension rights after divorce. Fanion was planning for his upcoming retirement, and according to Knowles in an interview with police, he feared losing part of his pension if he were to divorce his wife. The following day, Brian Fanion's inquiries into infidelity resumed, visiting web pages titled \"My perfect affair \u2013 how I'm getting away with it\" and \"Emotional Infidelity: Worse Than A Sexual Affair?\"",
      "Eleven days before Amy Fanion died, on April 27, Brian Fanion searched \"gsr testing\" on his work computer. That morning between 9:22 and 9:38 a.m., Brian Fanion visited five web pages related to gunshot residue. Among those web pages were \"Gunshot Residue Collection: The Decisions that Make or Break a Case\" and a news report on YouTube called \"What gunshot residue tests tell us.\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours\" this had nothing to do with Brian Fanion's work at the Westfield Police Department.",
      "\"He wasn't assigned to any active investigations in April and May of 2018 \u2026 that would necessitate looking up gunshot residue,\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\" \"Nobody in the Westfield Police Department does gunshot residue testing.\"",
      "On May 7, 2018, the day before Amy Fanion was shot dead, Fanion repeatedly searched how to remove frequent contacts from his phone. At his trial, Fanion's defense argued that he was in the process of getting a new phone and wanted to know how to erase data from his current one. Sandstrom prosecuted the case.",
      "\"Now, the defendant suggests that he did these searches because he's in the process of getting a new phone right before his wife's demise,\" Sandstrom told the jury. \"But he's not looking to delete all data off of his phone \u2026 he's searching how to delete the frequently contacted list because he doesn't want evidence of his relationship with Corrine being discovered by the state police.\"",
      "Fanion's trial for the murder of Amy Fanion began on Feb. 23, 2023. Sandstrom's first witness was Amy Fanion's sister, Anna Hansen. Hansen testified that after Amy's death, Brian Fanion confided that he was concerned about some searches he had made.",
      "\"I asked him what that search was, and he said how to make a murder look like a suicide,\" Hansen said on the witness stand. Under cross examination by the defense, Detective Tom Forest testified that he never found any searches related to those terms.",
      "On the morning of May 8, 2018, while Brian Fanion was still at work, he searched \"massachusetts medical examiner offices\" and visited a website that listed the units within the Massachusetts State Police forensics section.",
      "In her closing arguments, Sandstrom stated that that morning, Brian Fanion was preparing for his wife's murder. \"He's looking up and researching the units that will appear \u2026 after he's committed this murder. \u2026 the evidence in this case proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was going to murder Amy Fanion when he left the Westfield Police Department at 11:47 a.m. on May 8th.\"",
      "Brian Fanion's defense argued that Amy Fanion had anger issues and suffered from severe anxiety. After Amy's death, many members of her family signed a letter in support of Brian, stating that they were certain Amy had taken her own life. Several members of Amy Fanion's family took the stand, and although they were called as witnesses for the prosecution, their testimonies supported Brian Fanion's defense.",
      "After a month-long trial, the jury found Brian Fanion guilty of the first-degree murder of Amy Fanion. He was sentenced to life in prison. His conviction is under appeal.",

The U.S. military has hammered the Iran-backed Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15 in an operation dubbed \"Rough Rider,\" seeking to end the threat they pose to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.",
      "The Houthis have for more than a year launched strikes targeting Israel and Western vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. warships, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas sparked the war in Gaza by launching its unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023.",

      "In a statement that provided its most detailed accounting of the operation so far, CENTCOM, the U.S. military command responsible for the Middle East said: \"Since the start of Operation Rough Rider, USCENTCOM has struck over 800 targets.",
      "\"These strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders.\" \u00ad\u00ad \"The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defence systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,\" CENTCOM said.",

      "CENTCOM said that \"while the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69 percent. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55 percent.\"",
      "\"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis. The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,\" the military command said.",
      "\"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,\" it added.",
      "Al-Masirah TV on Sunday reported that U.S. strikes on the Yemeni capital Sanaa had killed at least eight people and wounded others.",

      "\"It was terrible to see that kind of incident, that situation. It was heartbreaking,\" Cruzat said. \"I couldn't even imagine that it's actually happening in real life, because normally we see that on TVs or movies.

The museum also released images of Andreas Kallmeyer Bloch and David Gregory digging underwater and excavating bricks and wood from the wreckage.",

      "Helicopters and aircraft dumped water on the raging fire through the night into Sunday morning at the Shaid Rajaei port. The explosion happened just as\u00a0Iran and the United States met Saturday in Oman\u00a0for the third round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "While no one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \"our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\"",

State TV also reported the fire was under control and will be fully extinguished later Sunday. It also said activities have resumed at the port, showing footage of containers of a commercial ship being unloaded.",

      "There were few details on what sparked the blaze just outside of Bandar Abbas, causing other containers to explode, BBC News reported.",
      "Private security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March. It is part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during\u00a0the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\" Ambrey said.",
      "In a first reaction Sunday, the spokesman of Iran's defense ministry Gen. Reza Talaeinik, denied reports that missile fuel had been imported through the port.",
      "\"No sort of imported and exporting consignment for fuel or military application was (or) is in the site of the port,\" he told state TV by phone. He called foreign reports on the missile fuel baseless.",
      "Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn't acknowledged taking the shipment.",
      "It's unclear why Iran wouldn't have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after\u00a0the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses\u00a0industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",

      "On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a \"stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area\" for the blast, without elaborating.",
      "Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran.",
      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher.",
      "Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State television also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered.",

      "How Pope Francis' funeral seating chart was arranged",
      "The official delegations were seated in a special section to the right of the altar outside of St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Francis made history as the first pontiff from South America. So it was only fitting that Argentina \u2014 Francis' native country \u2014 was represented in the front row with Argentine President Javier Milei. Milei sat next to his sister, Karina, who serves as general secretary of the presidency. Next to them was Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who was seated up front because the pope is the bishop of Rome.",
      "The seating arrangements following Italy were then based on the French diplomatic alphabetical order. So, for example, the United States wouldn't be \"U,\" it would be \"E\" after the French translation \"\u00c9tats-Unis.\" According to Reuters, reigning monarchs were given priority over other heads of state in the order.",
      "Where was Donald Trump sitting at the pope's funeral?",
      "Mr. Trump and the first lady walked into St. Peter's Square and were directed to their front row seats around 4 a.m. ET, ahead of the service. They were seated next to Estonian President Alar Karis, King Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain. Across the aisle, to their right, was Finland's President Alexander Stubb, with whom he was seen speaking at the start of the ceremony.",
      "As many pointed out online, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy was also seated in the front row - an aisle over from Mr. Trump.

    "summary": "The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic.",
    "story": [
      "Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over\u00a0Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program\u00a0on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium.",
      "The talks ran for several hours in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "A person close to Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, acknowledged that the meeting had started and later ended. The source spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Iranian state television also reported their conclusion.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi nor Witkoff\u00a0told state television after the talks that the parties exchanged written points throughout the day in discussions that he described as \"very serious and work-focused.\"",
      "\"This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,\" he said. \"We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions \u2014 though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved. Differences still exist both on major issues and on the details.\"",
      "A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were \"positive and productive.\"",
      "\"This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,\" the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. \"There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal. We agreed to meet again soon, in Europe, and we thank our Omani partners for facilitating these talks.\"",
      "Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome, offered a positive note at the end of Saturday's negotiations.",
      "Iran and the U.S. \"identified a shared aspiration to reach agreement based on mutual respect and enduring commitments,\" al-Busaidi posted on X. \"Core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed. Talks will continue next week with a further high level meeting provisionally scheduled for May 3.\"",
      "Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman on the eve of the talks and visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and arrived on Saturday to Oman.",
      "Meanwhile, on Saturday, a major explosion\u00a0rocked a port in southern Iran\u00a0just after the talks began, killing four people and injuring more than 500 others. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material \u2014 though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. The private security firm also linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant to the port as well.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity.",
      "U.S. President Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over\u00a0the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Mr. Trump, traveling to Rome for\u00a0the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\"The Iran situation is coming out very well,\" Trump said on Air Force One. \"We've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",
      "He added: \"There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal \u2014 a much nastier deal \u2014 and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.\"",
      "While Araghchi and Witkoff are again expected to speak through the Omanis, experts on both sides will also begin negotiating details of a possible deal.",
      "From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran's expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.",
      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop has also been repeated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "However, Iranians remain hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took over 1 million rial to buy $1.",
      "\"It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,\" Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. \"Of course, we shouldn't give them everything. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.\"",

      "\"He often reminded us... that we all belong to the same human family and that no one is saved alone,\" Re said.",

      "Ukraine launched an audacious offensive into the border Kursk region in August last year, catching even its Western allies off guard and dealing an embarrassing blow to Moscow. It took control of an estimated 500 square miles of land. Ukraine had hoped that controlling the Russian territory would give it leverage during any future ceasefire talks. However, their gains were slowly eroded and Ukrainian troops continued to lose control of the territory throughout early 2025.",

His body\u00a0lay in state for three days in St. Peter's Basilica, where members of the public have been filing past to pay their respects.",
      "Unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nested coffins \u2014 one made of cypress, one made of lead, and one made of elm \u2014 the famously humble Francis chose to be buried in a simple wooden coffin.",

      "\"A second edition [of the official funeral rites for pontiffs] became necessary, first of all because Pope Francis has requested it, as he himself has stated on several occasions of the need to simplify and adapt certain rites so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome may better expresses [sic] the faith of the Church in the Risen Christ,\" Archbishop Diego Ravelli, Master of Apostolic Ceremonies, said in a statement released by the Vatican at the time of the update.",
      "Archbishop Ravelli also said, \"The renewed rite also needed to emphasise even more that the funeral of the Roman Pontiff is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful person of this world.\"",
      "The other major break from papal funeral tradition is the place where Francis has chosen to be buried.",
      "In his last will and testament, published shortly after his death, Francis requested that he be laid to rest outside the Vatican, in the Papal Basilica of St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore, in Italian). He often visited that ancient church in Rome to pray before and after his travels.",
      "Many popes are laid to rest inside the Vatican, in the Vatican grottoes, a system of vaults on the lower level of St. Peter's Basilica. The church said seven popes in history have been buried at St. Mary Major, but Francis is the first one in centuries.",
      "\"I wish that my last earthly journey conclude precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary where I went for prayer at the beginning and end of each Apostolic journey to confidently entrust my intentions to the Immaculate Mother and thank Her for her docile and maternal care,\" Francis said in his will.",
      "\"The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration and with the only inscription: Franciscus,\" he specified. That is also a departure from other popes whose tombs include an inscription honoring their papacy.",
      "He was carried to his final resting place in a procession that drove slowly through the streets of Rome, with crowds lining up to catch a glimpse of the Popemobile bearing his coffin.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis's death at the age of 88 means the Catholic Church must choose a new leader. Here's how cardinals elect the next pontiff at the conclave.",
    "story": [
      "The reign of Pope Francis is over, and as the Catholic Church mourns his death, it is also looking to the future. Soon after Saturday's funeral, a papal conclave must be held to choose his successor, and the question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely-guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but there are currently about 135 cardinal electors who will convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis.",
      "Of those eligible this time around, a large majority \u2014 108 of them \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries; 10 are from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has not yet announced the date when the conclave will begin, but under church rules, it must be within 15 to 20 days after the pope's death, which in this case would fall in the first or second week of May.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",
      "Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing.",

      "A procession then carried the pontiff's coffin to his final resting place, a fifth-century church about 3 miles away that held special meaning for him.

The procession of the popemobile carrying the coffin was expected to take about 30 minutes. Then another, shorter service took place there before the interment.",

      "What's the schedule for Pope Francis' funeral procession?",

      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site \"Crux,\" said. Several of the likely frontrunners would represent continuity with the direction set by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",
      "No matter their leanings, Allen said, the cardinal electors will be looking for someone who can equal Pope Francis' stature on the world stage. \"They want, in part, someone who can have the same capacity to make it absolutely impossible for the wider world to ignore what the Catholic Church has to say.\"",

      "We are enlightened and guided by the passage of the Gospel, in which the very voice of Christ resounded, asking the first of the Apostles: \"Peter, do you love me more than these?\" Peter's answer was prompt and sincere: \"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\" Jesus then entrusted him with the great mission: \"Feed my sheep.\" This will be the constant task of Peter and his successors, a service of love in the footsteps of Christ, our Master and Lord, who \"came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many\" (Mk 10:45).",
      "Despite his frailty and suffering towards the end, Pope Francis chose to follow this path of self-giving until the last day of his earthly life. He followed in the footsteps of his Lord, the Good Shepherd, who loved his sheep to the point of giving his life for them. And he did so with strength and serenity, close to his flock, the Church of God, mindful of the words of Jesus quoted by the Apostle Paul: \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\" (Acts 20:35).",
      "When Cardinal Bergoglio was elected by the Conclave on 13 March 2013 to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, he already had many years of experience in religious life in the Society of Jesus and, above all, was enriched by twenty-one years of pastoral ministry in the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, first as Auxiliary, then as Coadjutor and, above all, as Archbishop.",
      "The decision to take the name Francis immediately appeared to indicate the pastoral plan and style on which he wanted to base his pontificate, seeking inspiration from the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi.",
      "He maintained his temperament and form of pastoral leadership, and through his resolute personality, immediately made his mark on the governance of the Church. He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalised, the least among us. He was a Pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. He was also a Pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church.",
      "With his characteristic vocabulary and language, rich in images and metaphors, he always sought to shed light on the problems of our time with the wisdom of the Gospel. He did so by offering a response guided by the light of faith and encouraging us to live as Christians amid the challenges and contradictions in recent years, which he loved to describe as an \"epochal change.\" He had great spontaneity and an informal way of addressing everyone, even those far from the Church.",
      "Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today's challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time of globalization. He gave of himself by comforting and encouraging us with a message capable of reaching people's hearts in a direct and immediate way.",
      "His charisma of welcome and listening, combined with a manner of behavior in keeping with today's sensitivities, touched hearts and sought to reawaken moral and spiritual sensibilities. Evangelization was the guiding principle of his pontificate. With a clear missionary vision, he spread the joy of the Gospel, which was the title of his first Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii gaudium. It is a joy that fills the hearts of all those who entrust themselves to God with confidence and hope.",
      "The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open. He often used the image of the Church as a \"field hospital\" after a battle in which many were wounded; a Church determined to take care of the problems of people and the great anxieties that tear the contemporary world apart; a Church capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds.",
      "His gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.",
      "It is significant that Pope Francis' first journey was to Lampedusa, an island that symbolizes the tragedy of emigration, with thousands of people drowning at sea. In the same vein was his trip to Lesbos, together with the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Archbishop of Athens, as well as the celebration of a Mass on the border between Mexico and the United States during his journey to Mexico.",
      "Of his 47 arduous Apostolic Journeys, the one to Iraq in 2021, defying every risk, will remain particularly memorable. That difficult Apostolic Journey was a balm on the open wounds of the Iraqi people, who had suffered so much from the inhuman actions of ISIS. It was also an important trip for interreligious dialogue, another significant dimension of his pastoral work. With his 2024 Apostolic Journey to four countries in Asia-Oceania, the Pope reached \"the most peripheral periphery of the world.\"",
      "Pope Francis always placed the Gospel of mercy at the center, repeatedly emphasizing that God never tires of forgiving us. He always forgives, whatever the situation might be of the person who asks for forgiveness and returns to the right path.",
      "He called for the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in order to highlight that mercy is \"the heart of the Gospel.\"",
      "Mercy and the joy of the Gospel are two key words for Pope Francis.",
      "In contrast to what he called \"the culture of waste,\" he spoke of the culture of encounter and solidarity. The theme of fraternity ran through his entire pontificate with vibrant tones. In his Encyclical Letter Fratelli tutti, he wanted to revive a worldwide aspiration to fraternity, because we are all children of the same Father who is in heaven. He often forcefully reminded us that we all belong to the same human family.",
      "In 2019, during his trip to the United Arab Emirates, Pope Francis signed A Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, recalling the common fatherhood of God. Addressing men and women throughout the world, in his Encyclical Letter Laudato si' he drew attention to our duties and shared responsibility for our common home, stating, \"No one is saved alone.\"",
      "Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice, imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions. War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.",
      "\"Build bridges, not walls\" was an exhortation he repeated many times, and his service of faith as Successor of the Apostle Peter always was linked to the service of humanity in all its dimensions. Spiritually united with all of Christianity, we are here in large numbers to pray for Pope Francis, that God may welcome him into the immensity of his love.",
      "Pope Francis used to conclude his speeches and meetings by saying, \"Do not forget to pray for me.\"",
      "Dear Pope Francis, we now ask you to pray for us. May you bless the Church, bless Rome, and bless the whole world from heaven as you did last Sunday from the balcony of this Basilica in a final embrace with all the people of God, but also embrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo explains why the Oscars are growing disconnected from audiences when they ignore popular films.",
      "The Oscars announced several changes and updates to their rules for next year\u2019s 98th ceremony, including permission for generative artificial intelligence to be included in consideration for nominations.",
      "\"With regard to Generative Artificial Intelligence and other digital tools used in the making of the film, the tools neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination. The Academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\" the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) shared in a statement.",
      "\"You're putting your finger on the scale when you're using this type of technology and, yes, humans are involved, but not in the outcome. What's involved here is the AI is doing the heavy lifting,\" Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor and host of the \"Arroyo Grande\" podcast, told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"This is fine for some parts of filmmaking: production design and even script[s] [making] alterations and plot lines, but there's a human element that you're going to want to rely on. Because humans are imperfect, and that's what makes art, and that's what makes the human experience. In many ways, it's our striving for perfection and missing that fascinates.\"",

      "The Oscars announced several changes to their rules last week, including permission for films to use an undefined amount of generative AI without it impacting nomination consideration. (Don Emmert/AFP via Getty Images)",

      "The film\u2019s editor, D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3, told tech magazine\u00a0Red Shark News\u00a0in January that AI tools from Respeecher, a Ukrainian software company, were used to improve the Hungarian dialogue spoken by stars Adrien Brody, who won for best actor at this year\u2019s Oscars, and Felicity Jones.",

We coached [Brody and Jones] and they did a fabulous job, but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.\"",

      "\"Every great story is about the hero trying to achieve something that's really out of his grasp, beyond him,\" he said. \"But for AI, everything is within its grasp. And I do worry that some of the craftsmanship and the artistic choices will be delegated to a computer rather than to another level of human interaction and collaboration.\"",
      "Arroyo doesn\u2019t see AI completely replacing creatives entirely, a common fear across Hollywood, but he does believe it could negatively impact the artistic process.",
      "\"You're always going to have a director, but if your set designs are being done by AI, and your costume design's being done by AI, your background music is being done by AI \u2026 you see the diminishing return.

      "OSCARS ARE OVER, 'OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AUDIENCE' AND SADDLED WITH DEI REQUIREMENTS: EXPERT",
      "\"I know a number of members of the Academy who don't vote at all, and they don't because they hate most of the films being offered and don't want to sit through them,\" he said. \"So, it's kind of their own personal defection in place.\"",
      "\"But I mean, on the whole, it's a good idea people at least consider the nominees in total that they're voting on. But I think they're nominating too many people. You can't have 10 movies nominated for best movie. It\u2019s too much. And so it can't also become a second career for members of the Academy to vote with knowledge on your nominees. And so they may have to readjust the sheer volume [of] the awards.\"",
      "According to AMPAS, most categories are voted on by eligible members of their respective branch (costuming votes for costuming, editors for editors, etc.) while certain categories \"may be open to members across all voting branches.\"",

      "He suggested sending screener links that can indicate whether someone has watched it, or possibly a questionnaire about what happens in the film, but, \"there's so much busy work that I think it defeats its own purpose, so they may have to walk that back.\"",
      "\"It's a good idea, but the answer is: Nominate less, curtail your categories so you have 10 rather than 30,\" Arroyo added.",

      "Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime. (iStock)",
      "\"The baby boomer population, being one of the largest groups, is also the fastest-aging group,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As we get more and more baby boomers \u2014 not just over 65, but into their 70s and 80s \u2014 we're going to see more and more of them developing some degree of cognitive impairment due to a plethora of reasons.\"",
      "Age is indeed the biggest risk factor, he noted.",
      "\"After age 65, our risk starts to increase. By the time we get to our 80s, that risk is about one in three,\" he said. \"And then after 85, it starts to go up even higher, to almost one in two.\"",
      "\"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk.\"",
      "The pandemic could have played a role as well, the neurologist said.",
      "\"This is still being understood, but it seems like COVID-19 also affected blood vessels in the body and the brain,\" he said. \"So people who already had a vulnerability for developing dementia could have had an acceleration or an earlier presentation.\"",

      "\"There's still a lot being done to figure out, you know, the chicken or the egg \u2014 is it that you're developing the disease and you're presenting with symptoms of loneliness earlier than others, or is it the loneliness and social isolation that increases your risk? I think it's probably both.\"",
      "There is a genetic component of dementia, the neurologist said, but the good news is that it\u2019s rare.",
      "SMARTPHONE USE COULD REDUCE DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"If you think about risks and protective factors like a seesaw, these rare genetic mutations may outweigh anything protective you do, but the nice thing is that because they're rare, the chances are you don't have those risks,\" he said.",
      "\"So you probably have genetic risk that can be outweighed to some degree by protective factors.\"",
      "Risk-reducing behaviors",
      "A major study published last year in The Lancet found that almost half of dementia cases are potentially preventable with lifestyle modifications.",

      "HEALTH BOOST AND DEMENTIA PREVENTION IN JUST 5 MINUTES A DAY",
      "Entering a specific stage of sleep called \"slow wave\" or \"stage three\" helps to clear out the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain, Salinas said.",

      "Speaking to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, Waltz was pressed about the alleged dysfunction inside the Pentagon\u2019s top ranks\u2014 and whether, in his view, the current Pentagon is equipped to deliver on lofty foreign policy goals, including helping broker a negotiated settlement in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "\"Can you do this in what appears to be a chaotic, weakened Defense Department?\" Bartiromo asked Waltz on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" citing reports of chaos and dysfunction, including recent firings of Hegseth\u2019s top aides, and reports he has been threatening polygraph tests for some staffers at the department.",

They were sort of a European Union-esque nation, and they were saying to the pro-slave states, 'Hey, if you want to count your slaves to have representation, more representation in Congress, we're not going to let you do that,' because they knew that that would codify things like slavery into our nation and the North stood up to the South,\" Beckwith said.",

      "Made during the 1787 Constitutional Convention, the Three-Fifths Compromise set forth that slaves would be counted as three-fifths of a person when counting a state's population for taxation and congressional representation. While it reduced the influence that slave-holding states initially wanted, it ultimately allowed them more seats in the House of Representatives and more sway in presidential contests in terms of the Electoral College than if free people were only counted.",
      "The Three-Fifths Compromise ended after the Civil War with the adoption of the 13th and 14th Amendments, abolishing slavery and establishing equal protection under the Constitution.",

The North said if the South wanted it to count its \"property,\" or its slaves, as whole people in the census, the North would in turn count its tables, chairs and all their belongings in their homes as part of their population as well, according to the lieutenant governor.",

And what that did, it actually limited the number of pro-slave representatives in Congress by 40%. This was a great move by the North to make sure that slavery would be eradicated in our nation,\" Beckwith said. \"They knew what they were doing. But now here you have Senate Democrats in today's American Republic who do not understand that.\"",
      "\"They think the Three-Fifths Compromise was something that was a scourge on Black people. That's not what it was. And how did we get to this place? We got to this because of DEI in education. We got here because you have professors at woke schools that will not teach the history of what actually happened back in the foundations of our nation,\" Beckwith continued. \"Many, many men and leaders in our nation's history knew how wicked slavery was. They knew that God had created Black people, White people, red people, all people in his image, and they were fighting for equality for all, but they're not taught that today, and that's why you had the Senate Democrats who were getting up talking about the Three-Fifths Compromise like it was some sort of terrible thing in our past it was not it actually was the exact opposite that helped to root out slavery and lead us into a more perfect union that we now see.\"",

But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",

      "The RockYou2024 leak, which exposed almost 10 billion passwords in July of last year, might seem like old news, but its impact is still felt today.",
      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high. For anyone still reusing passwords, the dangers are real \u2014 and growing.",

      "Username and password on tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why does password strength matter?",
      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.\u00a0Each \"yes\" earns you a point.\u00a0So, let\u2019s see how your password holds up in today\u2019s threat landscape.",
      "Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords \u2014 think six or eight characters \u2014 can be cracked in minutes by modern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you\u2019re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed.",
      "Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" \u2014 same characters, just more variety. Mix it up.",
      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",

      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Most companies use different vendors to run different parts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that.",
      "More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up!",
      "Hertz rental location (Hertz)",
      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

Chrome, which is the most popular browser out there, supports a wide range of extensions, and so do other Chromium-based browsers. However, these extensions are not always beneficial. While many are helpful for blocking ads, finding the best deals or checking grammar errors, some can end up doing more harm than good.",
      "I recently\u00a0reported on a group of malicious extensions that were stealing user data, and now a new report has flagged 35 more suspicious ones. These browser extensions request unnecessary permissions and have been reported to collect and share everything you do online.",

      "Sketchy extensions in the wild",
      "A recent\u00a0investigation by John Tuckner, founder of Secure Annex, revealed concerns about 35 Chrome extensions, posing potential privacy and security risks. These extensions, many unlisted on the Chrome Web Store, were collectively installed over 4 million times.",
      "Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior. They all use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs and execute scripts.",
      "What\u2019s more concerning is that at least 10 of these extensions carried Google\u2019s \"Featured\" badge, implying vetting for trustworthiness. This raises questions about Google\u2019s review process, as the badge suggests compliance with high standards for user experience, privacy and security.",

      "Why are these extensions bad?",
      "The main concern is the level of access these extensions quietly request and how they use it. With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge.",
      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from sketchy extensions",
      "If you\u2019re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1)\u00a0Keep your browser up to date: Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",
      "We reached out to Manus AI for a comment on this article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET",
      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As we move forward with AI like Manus, it\u2019s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.",
      "So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.",

      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it\u2019s that you should never take a company\u2019s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed.",
      "Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don\u2019t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year.",

Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,\u00a0it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773.",
      "Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals.",
      "The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed.",

      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",

      "Safety first: Smart systems on board",
      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

      "Yamaha first showed off this hydrogen outboard at the Miami Boat Show, then took it to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas to get the automotive and marine industries talking about hydrogen infrastructure. They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a legal battle over a woman's lawsuit against the U.S. government for FBI agents mistakenly raiding their home in Atlanta, Georgia.",
      "Trina Martin's home was broken down by FBI agents before dawn on Oct. 18, 2017. Agents stormed into her bedroom and pointed guns at her and her then-boyfriend while her son, 7, screamed for his mother from another room.",
      "Martin, 46, was blocked from attending to her child for what she said felt like an eternity until agents realized they had busted into the wrong house while looking for a suspected gang member.",
      "An attorney for Martin will go before the Supreme Court on Tuesday to ask for the reinstatement of her 2019 lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the agents of assault and battery, false arrest and other violations.",
      "AHEAD OF KEY SUPREME COURT ARGUMENTS, HERE'S WHICH STATES HAVE PASSED SCHOOL CHOICE MEASURES",
      "Toi Cliatt, left, and Trina Martin stand outside the home which the FBI mistakenly raided in 2017, in Atlanta on Friday, April 25, 2025. (AP)",
      "A federal judge in Atlanta dismissed the lawsuit in 2022 and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last year.",
      "The key issue the justices will consider is under what circumstances can the federal government be sued in an effort to hold law enforcement accountable.",
      "Martin's attorneys said Congress clearly gave the green light to those lawsuits in 1974 after a pair of law enforcement raids on wrong houses, as blocking the lawsuits would leave little recourse for her and others who experienced similar incidents.",
      "FBI Atlanta spokesperson Tony Thomas told The Associated Press that the agency cannot comment on pending litigation.",
      "Lawyers for the government argued in Martin's case that courts should not be \"second-guessing\" law enforcement decisions. The FBI agents did advance work and attempted to locate the correct house, making this raid different from the no-knock, warrantless raids that prompted Congress to take legislative action in the 1970s, the Justice Department claimed in court filings starting under the Biden administration.",
      "The 11th Circuit largely agreed with that argument when dismissing Martin's case, claiming courts cannot second-guess police officers who make \"honest mistakes\" in searches. The agent who led the raid said his personal GPS led him to the wrong place. The FBI's target was located a few houses away.",
      "Martin, her then-boyfriend, Toi Cliatt and her son were left traumatized, she said.",
      "\"We\u2019ll never be the same, mentally, emotionally, psychologically,\" she told The Associated Press on Friday at the home that was raided. \"Mentally, you can suppress it, but you can\u2019t really get over it.\"",

      "\"The road is hypnotizing,\" he said. \"I became a liability to my company.\"",
      "Martin said her son became extremely anxious, explaining that he began pulling threads out of his clothes and peeling paint off walls.",
      "Cliatt initially believed the raid was a burglary attempt and ran toward the closet, where he kept a shotgun. Martin said her son still expresses fear that she could have been killed if she confronted the agents while armed.",
      "\"If the Federal Tort Claims Act provides a cause of action for anything, it\u2019s a wrong-house raid like the one the FBI conducted here,\" Martin's lawyers wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.",
      "Other U.S. appeals courts have interpreted the law more favorably for victims of raids on wrong houses, creating conflicting legal standards that only the high court can resolve, the lawyers say.",
      "After agents broke down the door to the house, an FBI SWAT team member dragged Cliatt out of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.",
      "But one of the agents noticed he did not have the tattoos that the suspect had, court documents show. The agent asked for Cliatt's name and address, and neither matched those of the suspect.",
      "The room then went quiet as agents realized they had raided the wrong house.",

      "Another Gaza resident, Nidal Qawasmeh, expressed similar frustration to TPS-IL. \"These people are charging 30 percent just to give you cash. I just want to take care of my family, but everything costs me more because of this. Prices are insane.\"",
      "The specific amount received per family every month is around $270 (or 1,000 New Israeli Shekels), which was calculated as 80% of the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket, UNICEF told Fox News Digital. Smaller organizations like UNFPA and others also contribute, bringing the total to about $39.66 million per month, reaching 60% of Gaza\u2019s households, according to open-source data.",

      "Despite the scale of direct financial aid, which reaches over half of the enclave's population, Gaza\u2019s severe food insecurity and high inflation (91% and 118%, respectively, as of January 2024) underscore its importance. However, the way this money circulates within Gaza is far more complex. \"Hamas controls\u00a0much of the cash that enters Gaza through various channels,\" Ofer told Fox News Digital, \"People who receive money via mobile apps must convert it into cash to use in local markets, but this involves hefty fees, with many money changers tied to Hamas or its allies.\"",
      "TPS-IL reported that Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar recently warned that Hamas\u2019s economic strength in Gaza relies on billions of shekels in cash, paid as salaries and quickly reclaimed through taxes on merchants. In a letter to Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Sa\u2019ar urged the cancelation of the circulation of 200-shekel bills previously introduced into Gaza, saying that experts believe the move would severely damage Hamas\u2019s financial network. The Bank of Israel rejected the proposal, citing technical reasons and claiming that implementation was not feasible.",
      "Ofer's research found that the fees can range from 20% to 35%, meaning recipients lose a significant portion of their aid just to access it. \"In\u00a0videos from Gaza, you can see traders refusing to accept app funds and forcing customers to convert them into cash, knowing they will lose at least 20% in the process,\" he said.",
      "Peter Gallo, an international lawyer and former Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigator at the U.N., told Fox News Digital, \"If an investigator in Israel can figure it out, the aid agencies either knew or should have known. Twenty to thirty percent is just ridiculous. That\u2019s extortion. It\u2019s what some have politely described as a \u2018revolutionary tax.\u2019 In fairness, the aid agencies might argue they had no alternative, It is the cost of doing business, but it would have been better if they were honest about it from the start.\"",

Acute malnutrition among children is rising at alarming rates. The UNICEF humanitarian cash transfer program is, simply put, keeping children alive in the midst of a war not of their making by providing them with access to essential items for their survival.

      "India and Pakistan have intensified their hostilities over the hotly contested Kashmir region following a massacre of 26 mostly Indian tourists, which New Delhi linked to Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan denies it was behind Tuesday's attack by gunmen on a group of tourists in Kashmir. Both sides have since escalated the tensions by exchanging diplomatic and trade sanctions against each other and raising fears of a military conflict.",
      "INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS \u2018TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH\u2019 AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACK",
      "Here are five reasons why a flare-up between India and Pakistan matters:",
      "The Kashmir attack could lead to an armed conflict between 2 neighbors",
      "Under intense domestic pressure, India has hinted at the possibility of a limited military strike on Pakistan in response to what it called the \"terror attack\" with \"cross-border links.\" Pakistan has made it clear that it will respond militarily to an attack.",
      "This raises fears that an escalation by any one side could lead to a wider war. The last time the two nations came to blows was in 2019, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir.",
      "In 2021, the sides renewed a ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held. That relative calm was broken on Thursday after a brief exchange of fire between their armies.",
      "Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint between the archrivals",
      "Both India and Pakistan are armed with nuclear weapons. There are fears that any conventional war or skirmish between them could potentially turn into a nuclear exchange.",
      "India and Pakistan fought two major wars, in 1965 and 1971, but in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests, raising the stakes in any military conflict. It triggered a nuclear race and Pakistan reached that same milestone in 1998.",
      "Kashmiri villager women walk past the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials say is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Friday.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Dar Yasin)",
      "Since then, India and Pakistan have had one major border skirmish in 1999 that killed at least 1,000 combatants. The fighting only stopped after the U.S. intervened.",
      "A conflict could bring in China",
      "India and China are geopolitical rivals whose armies clashed along the disputed Himalayan border in 2020. Ties between the Asian giants have improved since, but they still maintain large numbers of troops on their borders. Their borders are also contiguous to Pakistan's, making it the world\u2019s only three-way nuclear junction.",
      "Beijing also controls a part of the Kashmir region that New Delhi says belongs to India.",
      "On the other hand, China is also a main ally of Pakistan and has helped advance its missile programs, creating additional military concerns for New Delhi. Meanwhile, India maintains strong defense ties with the U.S., which has long sought to limit Beijing\u2019s rise in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Experts say any conflict between India and Pakistan is unlikely to stay strictly between them, as their strategic partners are likely to get involved.",
      "Kashmir tensions can lead to a war over water",
      "In response to the massacre, India suspended a crucial treaty that governs the flow of river waters into Pakistan. Pakistan said it would consider any attempt to stop the flow of water from India an \"act of war.\"",
      "Under the Indus Water treaty, India is obliged to let six rivers flow freely to Pakistan. If India follows through and restricts the flow, it could have a devastating impact on Pakistan's agriculture as it battles acute water shortages.",
      "It's also a major environmental issue. Water insecurity is a big concern in both India and Pakistan due to rapidly growing populations and climate change.",

It has hurt India's human rights record and raised concerns that global powers are not doing enough to pressure New Delhi and hold it accountable.",
      "Militants fighting against Indian rule have also killed scores of civilians, including Hindu pilgrims.",

      "The port took in a shipment of \"sodium perchlorate rocket fuel\" in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",

Schools in Bandar Abbas will be closed on Sunday as well.",

It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran. Israeli officials didn't respond to requests for comment regarding Saturday's explosion.",

      "Indian and Pakistani soldiers briefly exchanged fire along their highly militarized frontier in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, Indian officials said Friday, as tensions soared between the nuclear-armed rivals following a deadly attack on tourists.",
      "India has described the massacre in which gunmen killed 26 people, most of them Indian, as a \"terror attack\" and accused Pakistan of backing it. Pakistan denied any connection to the attack near the resort town of Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir. It was claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance.",
      "INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS \u2018TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH\u2019 AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACK",
      "With the region on edge, three Indian army officials said that Pakistani soldiers fired at an Indian position in Kashmir late Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported.",
      "Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the report.",
      "Tensions rise",
      "Tuesday\u2019s attack in Kashmir was the worst assault in years targeting civilians in the restive region. Since then, tensions have risen dangerously between India and Pakistan, which have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, which is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety.",
      "On Wednesday, India suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty that has withstood two wars between the countries and closed their only functional land border crossing. A day later, India revoked all visas issued to Pakistani nationals with effect from Sunday.",
      "Pakistan responded angrily that it has nothing to do with the attack, and canceled visas issued to Indian nationals, closed its airspace for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India. Nationals from both sides began heading back to their home countries through the Wagah border near Pakistan\u2019s eastern city of Lahore on Friday.",
      "Islamabad also warned that any Indian attempt to stop or divert the flow of water would be considered an \"act of war.\" The suspension of the water treaty could lead to water shortages at a time when parts of Pakistan are already struggling with drought and declining rainfall.",
      "Pakistan has also warned it could suspend the Simla Agreement \u2014 in what would be a major and worrying step. The peace treaty signed after the 1971 India-Pakistan war established the Line of Control, a highly militarized de facto border that divides Kashmir between the countries.",

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin)",
      "\"Any issues between Pakistan and India, we believe can be and should be resolved peacefully, through meaningful, mutual engagement,\" the statement said Friday.",

      "Residents and police in southern Kashmir said Indian soldiers detonated explosives in the family homes of two suspected militants they accused of being involved in Tuesday\u2019s attack. In the past, Indian troops have demolished homes as a way to punish militancy in Kashmir.",
      "Authorities say they are investigating two local men and two Pakistani nationals for their alleged involvement in the attack. Officials have not elaborated or shared any evidence.",
      "\"He left home three years ago. We haven\u2019t seen him since and nothing was ever recovered from this house despite multiple raids,\" said Afroza, the aunt of one of the local men accused, Asif Sheikh. The blast partially damaged the house in Monghama village that she shares with Sheikh's parents and two sisters, including blowing out its windows. It also shattered windowpanes of several other homes.",
      "\"Even if he had done the attack, why blow up the house of a poor family,\" Afroza, who like many women in Kashmir uses only one name, said as she wailed.",
      "A police official and two residents in Guree village said a house there was also targeted by soldiers. The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with media while the two villagers feared reprisals from authorities.",
      "Protesters take to the streets",
      "Also Friday, hundreds of people rallied in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, to denounce the suspension of the water-sharing treaty.",

      "North Korea confirmed for the first time Monday that its troops were fighting alongside Russia in its war against Ukraine, saying they helped Moscow take back control of its Ukraine-controlled Kursk region.",
      "U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have said North Korea sent as many as 12,000 troops to Russia last fall to fight in Kursk, which Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last August. North Korea had not confirmed or denied those reports until now.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the troops\u2019 deployment under a mutual defense pact that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed in June 2024, North Korea\u2019s Central Military Commission said in a statement that was carried by state-run news agency KCNA. The treaty includes a pledge of mutual defense if either country is attacked.",
      "The statement said the operation to regain control of Kursk had been \u201cvictoriously concluded\u201d and that it was \u201can honor to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation.\u201d",

Ukraine denied that Kursk had been retaken, saying its defensive operations are continuing in some areas.",
      "If Russia is confirmed to have retaken Kursk, it would be a blow to Ukraine amid U.S.-led efforts to negotiate an end to the war, which is now in its fourth year. On Saturday, President Donald Trump questioned whether Putin \u2014 who last week launched one of the worst attacks on Ukraine\u2019s major cities since the war began \u2014 was willing to end the war.",
      "In exchange for providing Russia with reinforcements, North Korea gains valuable experience for its military, which has not been deployed overseas since the\u00a0Vietnam War. While North Korean soldiers are fiercely loyal to Kim, experts say their limited exposure to modern warfare leaves them vulnerable on the battlefield, especially against drones.",
      "About 4,000 of the North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured, according to South Korean officials. They said last month that North Korea had sent an additional 3,000 troops to aid Russia\u2019s war effort since the start of this year.",
      "The North Korean statement did not say how many of its troops were sent to Russia in total or how many casualties there have been.",
      "Kim said a monument to their \u201cbattle feats\u201d would be erected in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and that flowers would be placed \u201cbefore the tombstones of the fallen soldiers.\u201d He also said measures should be taken to \u201cpreferentially treat and take care of the families of the brave soldiers who participated in the war.\u201d",
      "The South Korean Ministry of National Defense denounced the North Korean troop deployment and said that by officially announcing it the North had \"effectively admitted to its criminal behavior.\"",
      "\u201cOur military strongly urges North Korea to immediately cease its deceitful and inhumane actions that threaten international peace and force the sacrifice of its residents through illegal military dispatches,\u201d the ministry said Monday.",
      "The deployment of troops to Russia is just part of Kim\u2019s efforts to expand the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. On Friday, he unveiled a new naval destroyer at a ceremony at a military shipbuilding dock in the port of Nampo, KCNA reported Saturday, saying the 5,000-ton warship would enter service early next year.",

      "Bondi said on X that members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, as well as of the Los Angeles-founded MS-13 gang, were detained.

      "Pullen said agents conducting surveillance at the venue spotted people they believe to be Tren de Agua and MS-13 members, as well as members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang.",
      "Bondi praised Trump for \"achieving results\" in his mission to \"make America safe again.\"",
      "Large-scale roundups of people suspected of being in the country illegally have long concerned advocates for immigrants, as well as civil liberties lawyers.",
      "The Colorado Rapid Response Network, which provides information about raids to immigrant communities, urged relatives of those detained to remind them that they may remain silent, do not have to sign any documents and can request legal representation.",
      "\"We don't know all the facts,\" the group said on Facebook.",
      "Partygoer Jose Dominguez said in an interview, part of which aired on NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver, that law enforcement put him and others in handcuffs until their presence in the United States could be determined as legal or not.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to fight, everywhere, all at once,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cLet\u2019s start with something that should be easy to say: It\u2019s wrong to snatch a person off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law.\u201d",
      "Cheers rang out in the audience at that comment at the annual McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club state party dinner, which brought in the largest crowd New Hampshire Democrats have seen since 2020, organizers said \u2014 more than 800 people. The presidential race is three years away, but animated Democrats who jumped to their feet several times Sunday signaled a hunger to hear about challenging the Trump White House.",
      "It was the first event in a historic early presidential primary state to host a potential 2028 presidential candidate \u2014 and in Pritzker, it featured a politician who has thrown down an early marker on how best to challenge Trump and the GOP, as different Democrats seek out different lanes in the early days before the next national election.",
      "In an interview, Pritzker batted away the notion that he\u2019s considering running for president, saying he has yet to decide whether he will seek a third term as governor in Illinois.",
      "But he has long been seen as a member of the short list of 2028 contenders, and as a billionaire who has self-funded his political campaigns in the past, he is well-positioned to launch a campaign. The state party dinner in New Hampshire is a traditional stop for potential presidential candidates in the years before a campaign.",
      "He has also been an early and consistent voice of opposition to Trump. In his state of the state address this year, Pritzker shifted to issue a warning about the administration\u2019s actions, saying, \u201cIf you think I\u2019m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic.\u201d",
      "New Hampshire has long been the first-in-the-nation primary state in Democratic presidential contests. That changed under President Joe Biden in 2024, but Democratic leaders have said they would most likely revamp the calendar again before 2028.",
      "Pritzker told the Democrats that he had never called for protests in the past but that he was now calling for \u201cmass protests,\u201d \u201cmobilization\u201d and \u201cdisruption.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans cannot know a moment of peace.\u201d Pritzker said.",
      "In the interview, Pritzker went even further, saying that if Democrats reclaim a majority in the House, they should investigate the actions of Trump administration officials, including who accessed sensitive taxpayer data.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold people responsible. They can\u2019t just get away with what they\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s breaking the law, anybody that\u2019s breaching the Constitution as a regular matter of the way they run their offices, those people all should be investigated if they are breaking the law.\u00a0... Think about the privacy of Social Security and Medicaid records and all of that DOGE went in and just breached, as if that\u2019s OK. How about IRS records, right? I mean, all of that.\u201d",
      "Back in his speech, Pritzker said Democrats should blame their losses in November on a \u201clack of guts and gumption,\u201d not on the party\u2019s defense of Black people, transgender kids and immigrants.",
      "\u201cVoters didn\u2019t turn out for Democrats last November not because they don\u2019t want us to fight for our values, but because they think we don\u2019t want to fight for our values,\u201d he said.",
      "He also took a shot at other Democrats' \"flocking to podcasts,\" without singling anyone out. California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently launched his own podcast, which has generated some controversy inside the party.",
      "\"What I find ironic about the current conversation surrounding our party,\" Pritzker said, \"is that the voices flocking to podcasts and cable news shows to admonish fellow Democrats for not caring enough about the struggles of working families are the same ones who, when it comes to relieving the struggles of real people, have been timid, not bold.\""

      "Two U.S. citizen children were sent on their mother\u2019s deportation flight to Honduras without the opportunity to speak with attorneys, leaving a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 cancer without access to his medication, according to the National Immigration Project.",
      "Gracie Willis, an attorney with the organization, told NBC News that the boy and and his 7-year-old sister were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Thursday. They were taken to El Paso, Texas, and flown to Honduras first thing Friday morning, Willis said.",
      "The 4-year-old boy, who was actively receiving treatment for a rare form of cancer, was flown to Honduras without his medication, according to Willis and the National Immigration Project.",
      "Attorneys were preparing a habeas corpus petition when the children were taken out of the U.S. on an ICE charter flight before the petition could be filed, Willis said.",
      "Attorney Erin Hebert, who Willis said is representing the family, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a press release by the National Immigration Project, Hebert called the removal of U.S. children \u201cillegal, unconstitutional, and immoral.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe speed, brutality, and clandestine manner in which these children were deported is beyond unconscionable, and every official responsible for it should be held accountable,\u201d Hebert said.",

      "These incidents are the latest in a string of cases that have raised alarm among immigration advocates. Recent headlines have highlighted U.S. citizens being mistakenly detained by ICE and, in some instances, receiving official paperwork incorrectly telling them to leave the country.",

      "In the cases of the young children, both families had fathers residing in the U.S. and were unable to make decisions about their children before they were flown to Honduras, Willis added. The National Immigration Project said the women were in incommunicado detention by ICE, making them unreachable by lawyers or family members.",
      "Legal teams that were able to reach the mothers after their deportations said the women both expressed being given no choice and that they were told their children would come with them, according to Willis.",
      "\u201cTheir families are having to make hard choices. ... Those are decisions they should have been able to communicate with each other about before all of this happened,\u201d Willis said.",
      "The National Immigration Project has accused ICE of violating its own mandates on the \u201ccoordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 when deportations are being carried out.\u201d",
      "Both families are taking time to process what has happened, Willis said. The children are U.S. citizens who should be able to return, but their mothers were deported before they were able to pursue their legal options.",
      "Representatives for ICE did not immediately respond to a NBC News request for comment. In the case of the 2-year-old, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the parent made the decision to take the child with them to Honduras.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the children\u2019s citizenship status on Sunday in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d saying that while everyone on U.S. soil is entitled to due process, individuals in the country illegally \u201chave no right to be here.\u201d",
      "He also described the headlines regarding the children as \u201cmisleading,\u201d stating that parents have the choice to decide whether their children are removed with them.",
      "\u201cThree U.S. citizens \u2014 ages 4, 7 and 2 \u2014 were not deported. Their mothers, who are illegally in this country, were deported,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe children went with their mothers. Those children are U.S. citizens. They can come back into the United States ... but ultimately, who was deported was their mother, their mothers who were here illegally.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe public has a right to know about what happened with these children, and we want to make sure this never happens again,\u201d Willis said. \u201cHow do we make sure this never happens again when you have Secretary of State Marco Rubio repeating the party line that the mothers wanted this?

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s small, toothy and often described as slightly creepy. But this plush doll, called Labubu, has quickly become an unlikely status symbol.",
      "In recent weeks, social media has been filled with videos of collectors trading tips on how to get their hands on a Labubu, the fluffy doll with pointed ears and a mischievous grin.",
      "Though the latest Labubu collection, which dropped on Friday and sold out in seconds, retails at $27.99 for one blind box or $167.94 for a set of six, resellers have already put them up on sites like eBay for more than double those prices.",
      "Labubu dolls are made and sold by Pop Mart, a Chinese retailer known for its \u201cblind box\u201d collectibles, which makes it so that buyers don\u2019t know which color or design they\u2019re getting until they open the box.",
      "Online restocks have earned a cutthroat reputation for selling out immediately, and buyers around the world have been known to camp out in front of Pop Mart stores for hours.",
      "From Beanie Babies to Squishmallows to the naked Sonny Angel figurines that exploded in popularity last year, collectibles have frequently fueled one consumer fad after another. As limited supply drives up their rarity, many fans seek the thrill of hunting down certain coveted versions, like the\u00a0special-edition \u201csecret\u201d Labubu, which can only be found by winning the blind box lottery.",
      "Thania Gonzalez, 31, said she has collected nearly every color of Labubu from every collection. But since the dolls began blowing up online late last year, the Los Angeles-based fashion content creator said purchasing them from Pop Mart has become virtually \u201cimpossible.\u201d Nowadays, she gets her Labubus from a reseller she calls her \u201cLabubu plug.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like to put them on my bags and dress them like me. I will wear multiple Labubus,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI\u2019m putting them on my belt. If I could put them as earrings I would, but that would hurt. I\u2019m putting them wherever they can be put.\u201d",
      "The craze has even spawned a market for fan-made outfits that can be used to dress up Labubu dolls. Gonzalez said she used to get hers from Chinese e-commerce platform AliExpress before finding local pop-up shops that specialize in those accessories.",
      "\u201cI think as adults, we have a lot of responsibilities, things to take care of, bills, people. People get a little bit in a rut,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Labubus bring people back to their childhood. It\u2019s like dressing them, how cute they are, just looking at them. It\u2019s like a little plush you can make look like you. I think it heals people\u2019s inner child.\u201d",
      "Created in 2015 by Kasing Lung, a Hong Kong\u2013born artist based in Belgium, Labubu is one of \u201cThe Monsters,\u201d a group of characters inspired by Nordic mythology in Lung\u2019s\u00a0children\u2019s book series. Labubu, according to Pop Mart\u2019s description, is \u201ckind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite.\u201d",
      "Pop Mart and Lung did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The dolls, which have become a symbol of exclusivity in themselves, are now often paired with luxury bags in a trend that seemingly contrasts luxury fashion with a less traditionally high-end \u2014\u00a0but still status-signaling \u2014\u00a0collectible.",
      "They\u2019ve also been boosted by celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink\u2019s Lisa, who have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags. Lisa, who sometimes shares her Labubus on her Instagram stories, told Vanity Fair last year that shopping for Pop Mart collectibles has become her \u201csecret obsession.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabubu is my baby,\u201d she told Teen Vogue last month.",
      "From Asia to North America, collection launch days at Pop Mart stores often draw crowds of customers anxious to snag their own Labubu. At the Michigan Avenue Pop Mart in Chicago, a line of people stretched down the block on Friday morning \u2014\u00a0many having brought foldable chairs and blankets \u2014\u00a0as they waited for the store to open.",
      "\u201cI got here early, just so I could get a Labubu,\u201d August Olvera, who was in line as early as 1:30 a.m., told NBC Chicago. \u201cMy boss called them hideous. But I think they\u2019re adorable.\u201d",
      "The frenzy has also bled into chaos. At the Pop Mart in Los Angeles\u2019 Westfield Century City mall on Friday, videos online appear to show hundreds of people rushing toward the store before dawn, drawing a police presence. Posts from attendees reported that the event was later canceled.\u00a0NBC News has reached out to Westfield Century City for comment.",
      "On communities like the r/labubu subreddit, hopeful collectors circulate tips on how to improve their chances of catching an online restock before all the Labubu dolls sell out. Others online have warned against leaving Labubus unattended, claiming that people have broken into cars to steal them.",
      "And the craze is giving rise to dupes, or replicas, of the popular collectible toys. It\u2019s led some Labubu enthusiasts to try and counsel others on how to spot the fakes, which have become so notorious that they\u2019ve been dubbed \u201clafufus.\u201d"

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., hosted hundreds of supporters at the Capitol on Sunday, sitting on the steps in protest of Republicans\u2019 upcoming push to pass a budget reconciliation bill they hope will cut $1.5 trillion in federal spending.",
      "\u201cThat bill, we believe, presents one of the greatest moral threats to our country that we\u2019ve seen in terms of what it will do to providing food for the hungry, care for the elderly, services for the disabled, health care, health care for the sick and more,\u201d Booker said at the beginning of the sit-in.",
      "Democrats have for months warned that House Republicans\u2019 budget blueprint would lead to over $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a federal program that provides health insurance for low-income families.",
      "Booker and Jeffries spoke at the beginning of the sit-in, which began around 6 a.m., about their religious upbringings, saying they would usually be attending services on Sunday morning but instead were hosting the conversation on the Capitol steps.",
      "\u201cMartin Luther King said, \u2018Budgets are moral documents,\u2019 and that\u2019s the spirit we come here with this morning,\u201d Booker said before he urged supporters to join the two men online or in person.",
      "The New Jersey senator called on supporters to \u201cgive your own testimony to your moral urgency that you feel, to maybe your faith traditions or moral traditions that ... motivate you at this moment to speak out, maybe share your story of what the threat of this bill does to you and your lives.\u201d",
      "Early in the day, Jeffries also pointed out that they were hosting the sit-in on Booker\u2019s birthday. After wishing the senator a happy birthday, the minority leader told him, \u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t expect last year, when thinking about this birthday, that I would be your birthday date in this location, but this of course is the moment that we find ourselves\u00a0in.\u201d",
      "Jeffries also brought a message for House Republicans, saying, \u201cEnough. This is not America. We will continue to show up, speak up and stand up until we end this national nightmare.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Monday, when congressional lawmakers will return from a two-week recess, Jeffries said Democrats were preparing to face \u201can existential struggle to defeat Republican efforts to try to jam a very reckless budget down the throats of the American people.\u201d",
      "Dozens joined Jeffries and Booker on the Capitol steps, where they sat in the sunshine for over nine hours speaking about their faith traditions and the upcoming budget fight.",
      "Some were rank-and-file supporters of congressional Democrats, while others were higher-profile progressive leaders, like Maya Wiley, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.",
      "\u201cThe [budget] cuts, when we\u2019re talking about cuts, people bleed and we should put names behind them,\u201d Wiley told the crowd. \u201cYou know, Sarah in South Dakota had a son who has seizures one to five times a day, had to quit her job to try to save her son. It is Medicaid that helps pay for her health care to do that. Or Jasmine in Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, with two kids, who was taking care of other people\u2019s children when she fell and became disabled, and it\u2019s Medicaid that was taking care of her.\u201d",
      "Several faith leaders and fellow Democratic lawmakers, like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., also spoke over the course of the sit-in, which was still ongoing Sunday afternoon.",
      "Booker is no stranger to speaking for hours in opposition to Republicans and the Trump administration.",
      "Earlier this month, he stood on the Senate floor and spoke for over 25 hours against the Trump administration, breaking the record for the longest speech in Senate history."

      "Neither Slotkin nor Walz mentioned Sanders in their remarks, but their comments come as Sanders and fellow progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have been traveling across the country and speaking before crowds of tens of thousands as part of their \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour.",
      "On Sunday, Sanders referred to those crowds, telling NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cWell, Jesus, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,\u201d Sanders added.",
      "A spokesperson for Slotkin declined to comment on Sanders\u2019 remarks.",
      "The Vermont senator went on to explain the core message of the \u201cFighting Oligarchy,\u201d rallies, telling moderator Kristen Welker, \u201cWhen the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%, when big-money interests are able to control both political parties, [Americans] are living in an oligarchy.\u201d",
      "The spat between Slotkin and Sanders comes as Democrats are still trying to assess how to move forward in a second Trump administration, months after they faced a devastating loss in the presidential election and in multiple Senate races.",
      "Many Democrats in recent weeks have agreed that the party must focus on the future and what their post-Trump vision for America could look like but can\u2019t agree on what that vision should look like.",
      "It\u2019s a point that Sanders made on Sunday, telling Welker, \u201cWe\u2019re on the same page, but what Democrats lack right now is a vision for the future.\u201d",
      "Sanders has long been the standard bearer for progressive Democrats, ever since he launched his long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.",
      "But Slotkin is a new rising star. In 2018, she flipped a competitive Michigan House seat in favor of the Democrats. And months after defending an open Senate seat in her home state for the Democratic Party, she was selected by party leaders to give the official Democratic response to Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress earlier this year."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/soccer/liverpool-win-english-premier-league-title-rcna202496",
    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 17:25:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Liverpool officially clinched the 2025 English Premier League title in the club's first season under manager Arne Slot.",
    "story": [
      "It was supposed to be a season of transition for Liverpool. Little did even the club\u2019s most optimistic fans know that it would be a transition straight into Premier League glory.",
      "With its 5-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, Liverpool bulldozed its way to a record-tying 20 English league titles. It draws Liverpool level with Manchester United as the winningest club in English soccer history. And with four matches still remaining in the season, Liverpool won the league convincingly.",
      "The season started in the shadow of doubt. Jurgen Klopp, the team\u2019s German tactician, departed the club after eight trophy-laden seasons. Klopp\u2019s blood-and-thunder style of play, known as \u201cgegenpressing,\u201d kept Liverpool fans on their feet with high-scoring, entertaining soccer. Klopp won the gamut as manager, including Liverpool\u2019s first English title in 30 years in 2020 and club soccer\u2019s most prestigious trophy, the UEFA Champions League, in 2019.",
      "But it was Klopp\u2019s embrace of Liverpool\u2019s community, his charm in press conferences and his signature hugging of players that endeared him to the Anfield faithful and lionized him as the club\u2019s father figure. His withdrawal from the Liverpool touchline at the conclusion of the 2024 season made fans anxious about what would come next.",
      "Cue Arne Slot, the up-and-coming Dutch manager tapped to replace Klopp. Slot had been successful in the Netherlands, leading his Feyenoord team to the Dutch championship, but a new league and a different caliber of play meant success was far from guaranteed.",
      "In his first press conference as a Liverpool manager in July, Slot acknowledged the gargantuan task of replacing a legend while remaining optimistic.",
      "\u201cThey are big shoes to fill,\u201d Slot said.\u00a0\u201cBut you can look at it as inheriting a squad and a team which has a winning culture. ... We have a real good squad, and as a manager, you want to work at a club with good players with an opportunity to win something.\u201d",
      "And win something his players did, with no squad member more consequential than Mohamed Salah, Liverpool\u2019s lethal right winger. Nicknamed the \u201cEgyptian King,\u201d Salah bagged goal after goal for the Reds this season. The prolific form skyrocketed Salah to the top of the Premier League goal-scoring charts, with 28 goals in 34 appearances.",
      "And it\u2019s not just goals. Salah has also managed to dominate the assist charts, leading the league with 18.",
      "Unlike Salah, who has consistently been Liverpool\u2019s most important player since his arrival in the Premier League in 2017, squad members like Ryan Gravenberch, Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Cody Gakpo have all found their top form under Slot after having struggled to reach those heights under Klopp.",
      "Slot\u2019s ability to get the most out of his Liverpool squad catalyzed the team\u2019s success. Undergirding the uptick in performances was a reinvention of the Liverpool style of play.",
      "With Klopp at the touchline, Liverpool became famous for eccentric, counterattacking chaos that led to many goals for, but also against, Liverpool.\u00a0Under Slot, that chaos has been contained.",
      "And while multigoal thrillers aren\u2019t as common on Merseyside, Slot\u2019s more possession-oriented style of play has led to fewer goals conceded and more consistent wins. In Klopp\u2019s last season, Liverpool recorded only 10 clean sheets, or shutouts, in the Premier League. So far this season, Slot\u2019s squad has already kept 14, the most in the league.",
      "Though Slot and Klopp coach their teams using different philosophies, one important value of Liverpool Football Club has remained constant throughout the transition: trusting the team\u2019s youth.",
      "Klopp turned teenagers like Trent Alexander-Arnold, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott into stars of the Premier League. Slot is continuing in that vein, giving youngsters like Jarell Quansah and Conor Bradley ample time to shine.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very important for every club, but especially for this club,\u201d Slot said in January. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see there are some youngsters who are having an impact in our team and on games. It\u2019s nice because it gives good energy in the building if the academy players are playing well.\u201d",
      "Superstars like Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher all emerged from Liverpool\u2019s academy over the years. Slot managed to maintain that commitment to bringing through youth while also claiming silverware.",
      "Without taking away from Slot\u2019s impressive achievement, it\u2019s worth noting that Liverpool\u2019s traditional rivals had underwhelming seasons. Liverpool\u2019s main rival in recent years, Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City, self-destructed early in the season after it lost Rodri, its defensive midfield maestro. Before this season, City had won an unprecedented four titles in a row.",
      "Closest to Liverpool in the table is Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal. The Gunners appeared capable of putting up a title challenge earlier in the season before they were plagued by injuries and consequent mediocre performances.",
      "And Liverpool\u2019s historical biggest rival, Manchester United, is languishing at the bottom half of the table, at 14th. While this season\u2019s trophy ties Liverpool with United as the most successful teams in English soccer history with 20 titles each, momentum, squad depth and managerial success suggest Liverpool is much closer to 21 than Manchester United."

      "Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise bombardment on March 18, and has been carrying out daily waves of strikes since then. Ground forces have expanded a buffer zone and encircled the southern city of Rafah, and now control around 50% of the territory.",
      "Israel has also sealed off the territory\u2019s 2 million Palestinians from all imports, including food and medicine, for nearly 60 days. Aid groups say supplies will soon run out and that thousands of children are malnourished.",
      "The overall death toll includes nearly 700 bodies for which the documentation process was recently completed, the ministry said in its latest update. The daily toll includes bodies retrieved from the rubble after earlier strikes.",
      "Israeli strikes killed another 12 people after the ministry\u2019s update. Eight of them, including three children and two women, were killed in a strike on a tent in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. A strike in the central city of Deir al-Balah killed four people, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.",
      "Israeli authorities say the renewed offensive and tightened blockade are aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed or disarmed, and all the hostages are returned.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the now-defunct ceasefire reached in January.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took 251 people hostage. Most have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says women and children make up most of the Palestinian deaths, but does not say how many were militants or civilians. It says another 117,600 people have been wounded in the war.",
      "The overall tally includes 2,151 dead and 5,598 wounded since Israel resumed the war last month.",
      "Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and it blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants operate in densely populated areas.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population, leaving hundreds of thousands of people sheltering in squalid tent camps or bombed-out buildings."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038",
    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 16:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Immunotherapy let some cancer patients with mismatch repair deficient tumors completely avoid surgery, chemo and radiation, a clinical trial finds.",
    "story": [
      "Maureen Sideris was driving to Maine for a wedding when she realized she couldn\u2019t swallow the sandwich she was having for lunch.",
      "The 71-year-old was soon diagnosed with gastroesophageal cancer. It was August 2022. The tumor, she said, blocked off a portion of her esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, making it difficult to swallow food.",
      "The standard treatment approach for esophageal cancer \u2014 chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery to remove part of the esophagus and stomach  \u2014 \u201cis quite devastating,\u201d said Dr. Luis Diaz, the head of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \u201cOne can overcome that, and there\u2019s a new normal after that, but it\u2019s not like what it was before.\u201d",
      "Going through all of those treatments, Sideris said, \u201cwould have been horrendous.\u201d",
      "Instead, she received just one treatment \u2014 immunotherapy \u2014 as part of a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It\u2019s been two years since she completed her treatment and she\u2019s in remission.",
      "Diaz, the senior researcher on the clinical trials, said when the first person in the trial responded to the immunotherapy, it was exciting.",
      "\u201cYou can say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re done. You don\u2019t need chemotherapy, radiation or surgery,\u2019\u201d Diaz said.",
      "The approach won\u2019t work for everyone. The Phase 2 trial focused on people whose tumors had what\u2019s known as mismatch repair deficiency, a mutation that means mistakes in the DNA aren\u2019t fixed when cancer cells replicate. This leads to even more mutations.",
      "For the treatment to work, \u201cthe tumors need to have this mutation,\u201d said Dr. Andrea Cercek of\u00a0Memorial Sloan Kettering. Cercek led the clinical trial and presented the findings at the American Association for Cancer Research\u2019s annual meeting on Sunday in Chicago. The research was simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Mismatch repair deficiency occurs more frequently in some cancers than in others. About 16% of ovarian cancers and as much as 30% of endometrial cancers have the mutation, compared to 10%-20% of colorectal cancers. Between 8% and 22% of nonmetastatic gastroesophageal cancers are mismatch repair deficient.",
      "Immunotherapy drugs work by teaching a person\u2019s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The drugs have been found to work particularly well against tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies, because the many mutations provide more targets for immune cells.",
      "However, the drugs typically aren\u2019t used as a first-line treatment for these cancers. Instead, they\u2019re brought in if approaches like chemotherapy and radiation don\u2019t work, or if a cancer returns or has already spread.",
      "The new trial expanded on a smaller study from Cercek that used the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab as the first treatment in 12 people with rectal cancers that were advanced but had not spread elsewhere in the body. All of the people\u2019s tumors had mismatch repair deficiencies. Everyone underwent immunotherapy treatment for at least six months. At the end of that time, all 12 had a complete response, meaning there was no evidence of the tumor remaining. None of them had to undergo other cancer treatments that would usually be used to treat these types of cancer, including surgery.",
      "The researchers started with rectal cancers because the treatments, and in particular the surgery, can be life-changing. Surgery may involve removing the rectum \u2014 the final portion of the large intestine before the anus. Patients who undergo this surgery must have a colostomy, an operation where the intestine is rerouted to a hole made in the abdomen for stool to pass out of the body into what\u2019s known as an ostomy bag. \u201cThis will have a significant impact on your quality of life,\u201d Diaz said.",
      "The second part of the trial expanded the treatment to more people, including patients with other cancers known to have mismatch repair deficiencies, including cancers of the esophagus; endometrium; kidney and ureters; and liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Everyone enrolled in the trial had early-stage cancer, meaning it hadn\u2019t spread to other organs.",
      "Sideris was one of the first people with a noncolorectal cancer to be cleared for the treatment in the trial.",
      "During her first appointment, Sideris was hooked up to an IV that dripped the immunotherapy into her bloodstream. \u201cWithin 45 minutes, it\u2019s done,\u201d she said.",
      "Sideris repeated the process every three weeks over the next six months as Cercek and her team enrolled other people who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. They were divided into two categories: those with colorectal cancers, and those with the other types.",
      "The first group, rectal cancers, included 49 patients who completed six months of immunotherapy. All of them responded to the therapy and didn\u2019t need surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. About 75% of them were still cancer-free a year or more after completing the treatment.",
      "In the second group, 54 people completed the six-month treatment, and 35 \u2014 about 61% \u2014 had complete responses and didn\u2019t need to undergo further treatment. The researchers didn't look at data on the patients\u2019 12-month results.",
      "Sideris said she\u2019s grateful she didn\u2019t have to endure the side effects of chemotherapy, but the immunotherapy did cause adrenal insufficiency, a known side effect of the drug. She\u2019s now taking medication to manage the condition.",
      "Still, Sideris said, \u201cit was like winning the lottery.\u201d",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, cautioned that mismatch repair deficiencies only account for \u201c1%-2% of cancers at most.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is not going to be something that is a cure-all,\u201d he said.",
      "But for people who do have this type of cancer, the findings offer substantial hope: Cancer surgery can often be \u201clife-altering,\u201d Kamath said. \u201cA huge number might not need surgery at all and can be cured from the immunotherapy alone.\u201d",
      "Diaz said that for patients with mismatch repair deficiency, it may be possible to avoid 80% of operations.",
      "Being able to preserve people\u2019s organs by avoiding surgery can have a huge effect on quality of life. Depending on the surgery, patients could experience sexual dysfunction, loss of bowel control, acid reflux and infertility. Chemotherapy and radiation can also hurt fertility. This is particularly important at a time when more young people are being diagnosed with cancer, Cercek said.",
      "The research also suggests that immunotherapy could possibly be used as a first-line treatment for early-stage mismatch repair deficient cancers.",
      "\u201cImmune therapies have a ton of potential. This shows we might be able to start with that,\u201d said Dr. Heather Yeo, a surgical oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.",
      "Diaz said that while larger studies are needed to confirm the trial\u2019s findings, using immunotherapy in place of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy may not be far off for certain patients.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a short step from this report to application of standard of care,\u201d he said.",
      "CORRECTION (April 27, 2025, 1:52 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the complication of Sideris' treatment. She developed adrenal insufficiency, not kidney failure."

      "Country star Eric Church admits he's still having a hard time moving on from the Las Vegas massacre, which is said to be the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.",
      "On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of hotel onto a crowd watching Jason Aldean perform at the\u00a0Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. Police reported at least 58 people were killed in the shooting and more than 500 people were injured.",
      "Church, who performed at the venue just two days before the massacre, tells Sunday Sitdown host Willie Geist that he was never the same after he heard what had happened.",
      "\"I mean, we've all had bad years, but,\u00a02018 was a really bad year for me and it started with Vegas,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s certain indelible things that you just don\u2019t get over, and I think that was one for me.\u201d",
      "\"And after that, right after that, I had a health scare. I had a blood clot and thought I was going to die,\" Church continued. \"And then, my brother died, you know? So all this happened, within a matter of months.\"",
      "In 2018, Church revealed to Rolling Stone that he underwent an emergency surgery for a blood clot in his chest that was due to a birth defect. That was also the same year that his brother, Brandon, died.  The country star explained that those events humbled him in more ways than one.",
      "\"I think, up until that point, you can listen to the music, maybe, and you can see that I was brash, arrogant, in a lot of ways,\" he told Geist. \"But it changes, when you have those things happen to you. And I think it made the music more humble and, maybe, more observant.\"",
      "Church also opened up about how the Las Vegas shooting affected him, explaining that the bond between an artist and their fans is \"sacred,\" but that bond was \u201cshattered\u201d when gunman Stephen Paddock decided to cut some of those lives short.",
      "\"I had a lot of fans die,\" Church said. \"And I played the (Grand Ole) Opry right after that, and didn\u2019t want to be there. But I remember, there were a number of fans that had went to the Vegas show that were then going to fly across the country to come to the Opry show, to see me play the Opry.\"",
      "\"That was a part of their travel and some of \u2018em got shot,\" he said. \"They died. And I remember being at the Opry, that night and... it\u2019s still raw in a lot of ways, but just not something that affects you. And it broke me, in a way.\"",
      "Church performed at the Grand Ole Opry just days after his performance in Vegas. While onstage, he paid tribute to the victims with a new heartfelt song called \u201cWhy Not Me.\"",
      "In the song, he says, \"And when the morning sun hits the mountain / And a glorious still calms the breeze / I\u2019ll ask the God of infinite wisdom / Why you and why not me?\""

      "Like \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" is a prequel. The story follows 16-year-old Haymitch Abernathy as he navigates being reaped and having to fight to the death in the 50th annual Hunger Games.",
      "The novel shows how Haymitch manages to win his Games, becoming a rebel in the process. For fans of the original trilogy, it also provides the much-needed backstory to Haymitch's standoffish behavior and unhealthy coping mechanisms that readers likely associate with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark's mentor.",

      "Lenore Dove loves to sing but has a penchant for trouble as her rebellious tendencies often get the better of her. At the start of the novel, to mark Haymitch's 16th birthday, she gifts him a gold flint striker, which becomes the token he brings into the Games.",
      "Before being cast, Peak, 22, appeared in several shows and movies. She's best known for playing Stella in \"Molly's Game\" and Judith in \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\" She was also in the \"Gossip Girl\" reboot and \"Hocus Pocus 2.\"",

      "Maysilee Donner",
      "Mckenna Grace will play Maysilee Donner, who is also part of District 12.",
      "Haymitch initially dislikes Maysilee as the two come from different worlds. Haymitch, who lives in the Seam \u2014 the poorest part of District 12 \u2014 doesn't like Maysilee's display of wealth and privilege. On top of that, Maysilee is a bully, never skipping the opportunity to call someone out, especially when it comes to their fashion choices.",

      "\u201cThe goal with designing the ochi was to create a realistic-feeling undiscovered primate species, so that a kid watching the film could wonder, \u2018Have I just not seen the BBC nature special yet on this animal?\u2019 Like, this feels like a real animal,\u201d Saxon says.",
      "\"The Legend of Ochi,\" out April 25, stars Helena Zengel alongside Finn Wolfhard, best known from his role as Mike Wheeler on \u201cStranger Things.\u201d When Zengel\u2019s character Yuri discovers a baby ochi who has been left behind, she\u2019s determined to do whatever it takes to get the adorable creature back to its pack.",
      "The pair go on an adventure through woodlands, waters and even a grocery store, where the baby ochi quickly melts the hearts of the characters and viewers alike.",
      "Filmed in the Carpathian mountains of Romania, the film takes fantastical elements from its location \u2014 but the magic of the baby ochi is that it is a puppet, Wolfhard tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see the ochi actually in action until I was on set, and the puppeteers showed me. Basically, they said, \u2018Do you want to meet him?\u2019 And I just looked at the puppet, and it looked up at me and blinked and had head movements,\u201d Wolfhard said. \u201cIt was like a truly real creature.\u201d",
      "There are complicated mechanics behind bringing the ochi to life, Wolfhard says, but it all comes together to make the ochi appear like a real-life animal.",
      "\u201cThe ochi had a whole team of people, and all the puppeteers are actors because they are all trying to get a very specific performance out of the ochi,\u201d Wolfhard says. \u201cIt was six people piloting one creature, as opposed to just one actor, but they were such amazing performers. That\u2019s why I like working with practical effects \u2014 it\u2019s so fun because you have that human connection with it.\u201d",
      "Saxon says inspiration for the gremlins came in part from his longtime obsession with Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys. He also took elements from lemurs, tarsiers and other primates for the look of the ochi, while borrowing from birdsong and the noises dolphins make for the language the animals use in the film.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t looking to movie creatures or mythical creatures. It was looking to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wanted to pull from the wide variety of superpowers that you do find in nature, and real patterns in zoology, and put them into one fictional animal.\u201d",
      "The cuteness factor for the baby ochi was important from the start, Saxon says. After drafting up several drawings of what the ochi would look like for the film, Saxon says he reached out to John Nolan Studios in London to create animatronics for the creatures.",
      "\u201cThey made a prototype that was completely furless and had no facial movement, but immediately, the five puppeteers brought it to life, it was just completely convincing that this was a real being,\u201d Saxon recalls. \u201cIt was absolutely adorable from the break.\u201d",
      "Saxon says designing the baby ochi as a puppet adds characteristics that play into how lovable the creature becomes throughout the film.",
      "\u201cA lot of the little imperfections that you might see in a baby primate trying to move learn how to move their own body, those are the types of little things that come through in rod puppeteering,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it had that vulnerability from the beginning, from the puppetry.\u201d",
      "Once the crew was on set filming in Romania, \u201cthere was a tremendous amount of effort in just like, policing his cuteness,\u201d Saxon says of the baby ochi.",
      "He joked about a \u201clast-minute rhinoplasty\u201d to make the baby\u2019s nose cuter after realizing it wasn\u2019t quite right, and other situations on set to ensure the creature had the look he was going for.",
      "The film, which launched in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on April 17, is headed to theaters nationwide on April 25. But the hype for the charm of the baby ochi is only just beginning, as viewers start to react to the gremlin on social media.",
      "\"I just watched THE LEGEND OF OCHI and I want everyone to know that I would die for this little guy,\" one user posted on X.",
      "\"I completely adored THE LEGEND OF OCHI. It pulls inspiration from Amblin movies like E.T., Jim Henson\u2019s classics, and even Ghibli, but still takes tons of *weird* swings that create its own identity full of wonder,\" another X user wrote. \"They literally don\u2019t make family adventures like this anymore.\"",
      "\"Just like 'E.T.' was for so many of my generation I hope there\u2019s a kid out there whose new favorite movie is THE LEGEND OF OCHI and it inspires them to become a filmmaker,\" another X user posted. \"Lovely movie.\"",
      "Another X user said: \"The Legend of Ochi is a wholesome fantasy adventure. It has really beautiful puppetry and practical effects that really make the Ochi come to life. You love every second baby Ochi is on screen. The world feels very beautiful and unique.\"",
      "Others, understandably, were just reacting to finding out how adorable the baby ochi is.",
      "\"How have I not heard about this darling baby Ochi until today?\" a user wrote on X, adding a teary-eyed emoji and two heart-eye emoji.",
      "\"In love with this little guy,\" another X user said with a heart-eyed emoji. \"can\u2019t wait to see the movie!\"",
      "\"Omg he\u2019s perfect,\" another replied on X to a photo of the baby ochi puppet wearing a baseball cap.",
      "A24, the film's distributor, also joined in on the fun, posting a photo of the baby ochi with its arms raised with the caption, \"When you find out The Legend of Ochi isn't nationwide until next Friday but you need that little guy right now.\"",
      "\"The Legend of Ochi\" premieres in theatres on April 25."

    "summary": "Penn Badgley describes relationship with 'Gossip Girls' costars as 'amicable silence.'",
    "story": [
      "Penn Badgley says he still feels \"love\" for his former \"Gossip Girl\" co-stars, even if they aren't in constant contact with one another.",
      "\"Between us all, I think it's an amicable silence. Like when you have, you know, roommates from college, you're like, 'Man, we loved going to school together' and then you grow up, you sort of go in different ways. But I think there's just, yeah, it's just love for them all,\" Badgley, 38, told E! News at the Season 5 premiere of his\u00a0Netflix\u00a0thriller\u00a0\"You\" on April 23.",
      "Badgley, who played Dan Humphrey on the hit series that ran from from 2007 to 2012, also shared his thoughts on the tragic death of late co-star Michelle Trachtenberg, who played the villainous Georgina Sparks.",
      "Badgely called Trachtenberg's death at age 39 \u2014 which was caused by complications of diabetes mellitus \u2014\u00a0 \u201creally surreal\" and \"really saddening.\"",
      "He also described Trachtenberg as someone with a \"really pure heart.\"",
      "\"What I remember of her is she was incredibly quick to laugh,\u201d said Badgley. \u201cShe was really joyous. We all have our ups and downs, our lights and shadows, but she had this, I mean, she was mature, but she had this childlike, joyous laugh.\u201d",
      "Badgley also opened up this week about what a \u201cstruggle\u201d it was to date co-star Blake Lively while the pair were portraying on-off couple Dan and Serena on the show.",
      "Badgley, who shares a son\u00a0James, 4, and is expecting twins with wife\u00a0Domino Kirke, recalled on the April 23 episode of\u00a0the \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast that he felt consumed at the time by the pressures of being on a top-rated TV show.",
      "\u201cWhen you do a television show, you\u2019re doing it constantly because of the nature of that show,\u201d said Badgley.\u00a0\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re constantly, even though no one may be actually asking you to do this, you feel like you\u2019re constantly needing to prove yourself in some manner. Otherwise, what are you doing?\u201d",
      "Badgley also said he believed that after six seasons, some viewers  weren't able to differentiate between him and Dan.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re seen as this person, you\u2019re called their name out on the street. You also constantly have to be that person at work, and I was 20, I was 21, 22. So like I didn\u2019t have the emotional maturity to understand, to differentiate myself just in terms of self-worth.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is not enough separation, I think, for anybody,\u201d said Badgley.",
      "Badgley previously spoke glowingly about Lively in a February 2023 interview with Variety.",
      "The actor, who told the publication that he \"didn\u2019t want to be in television\" during his time on \"Gossip Girl,\" said, \"I was biding time a lot with Dan \u2014 I was not invested.\"",
      "He recalled that it was \u201cfun and fast-paced\u201d time in his life until a \u201cdark undercurrent\u201d emerged later in his 20s.",
      "When Variety asked the actor if he'd struggled with substance abuse, he said he never did and gave credit to Lively for abstaining from alcohol herself.",
      "\u201cBlake didn\u2019t drink, and I think our relationship in some ways saved me from forcing myself to go down that road,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cIt would appear that mental health appears to be the underlying issue here,\u201d Mayor Ken Sim said at a news conference Sunday.",

      "More than two dozen more were injured in the attack, according to the police statement.",

He also said the police department and the city will work to review \u201call of the circumstances surrounding the planning of this event.\u201d",

      "\u201cOur thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver\u2019s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time,\u201d Sim said.",

      "\u201cToday, God sends us cans, so we\u2019re cooking them for the children,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai, 57, said of the canned beans that she stirs in a simmering pot. It's the 558th day of the war, and the children, along with the adults, are hungry, covered in dust, haunted by death and facing another day of scraping together a life from the ruins of the Gaza Strip.",
      "NBC News' crew on the ground spent a day with the Al-Zurai family, from early morning to sunset, to see how they, and thousands of families across the enclave, are living after the ceasefire broke, and Israel began a blockade in early March, barring the entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into the enclave.",
      "There are 16 members of the Al-Zurai family to share the single pot of beans, eight of them children. At least five more should be there with them, Suad says.",
      "One of her sons was killed along with two of her grandchildren, while another, Khaled Al-Zurai,\u00a0has been missing for days after an explosion that killed one of his sons. Suad is now taking care of his wife, who has cancer, and their four surviving children. Her third son, Hamed Al-Zurai, and his four children also live with her. Other relatives are displaced to other parts of Gaza.",
      "Suad's exhaustion is palpable as she stirs the pot under a blazing sun.",
      "For her, enduring survival has begun to feel like death. \u201cWe all die 100 times, every day,\u201d she said, \u201cwe die 100 times daily from fear and horror.\u201d",
      "Her slain loved ones are among more than 51,000 people who have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local health ministry, since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed during the attacks in southern Israel and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Throughout the course of the day, worries over food, water and other necessities dominate the family's discussions, and finding those supplies takes up much of the rest of their time as humanitarian groups warn that aid is running out.",
      "At one point, Hamed Al-Zurai's 3-year-old daughter, Anwar, throws herself to the floor, crying out for rice, but there isn\u2019t any more to give her.",
      "\u201cMy children are constantly crying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eat. And I answer them, \u2018How? There are no open crossings, so how can I get you food, my love?\u2019\u201d",
      "Before the war, most of the children spent their mornings at school. Now, they dedicate hours each day to trying to find food and water.",
      "Pushing their fears for their missing father aside, Khaled Al-Zurai's children, Mohammed, 13, and Suad, 12, dutifully pick up their pots and pans and head to the soup kitchen with their cousin, Shadi, 7, taking NBC News' crew with them on the roughly 30-minute walk.",
      "At the soup kitchen, there's already a crowd of other children, along with some women and men, waiting for food under the hot sun. The younger Suad stands with her empty pot in her hands, gazing into the distance, bored and exhausted, as she waits, later joining her brother and sister and sitting in a ditch in the shade before they try again.",
      "On offer is rice \u2014 and after waiting for an hour, they fill their pots, carrying it back to their tent.",
      "While they're getting food, Hamed and young Anwar are out to get water for the family. Anwar walks swiftly as she carries two water jugs, each nearly half the size of her small body.",
      "Before the war, Hamed Al-Zurai had a cart and a donkey that he would use to rent out transportation services, but after the donkey died in the war and he lost his cart, he no longer has a way to make money. Unable to buy food or water, the family is left dependent on swiftly dwindling aid.",
      "\u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d he said.",
      "But even at a time of incredible darkness, there are moments of light for the Al-Zurais: smiles as they gather together in their tent, finally sharing their hard-won lunch.",
      "After eating, Mohammed gives his younger siblings and cousins old rubber tires to play with. Anwar grins as she wheels one across the sandy ground.",
      "As the sun goes down, the children huddle in a circle outside, laughing as they play hand-clapping games. And for a moment, they look just like any other children anywhere else in the world.",
      "Then, they return to their makeshift tent to eat a meager dinner of more rice and beans, before eventually settling down for bed, huddling together on the ground, wrapped in blankets.",
      "\u201cWe hate the nighttime,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai said. And, she added, \u201cthe daytime.\u201d"

      "North Korea confirmed for the first time Monday that its troops were fighting alongside Russia in its war against Ukraine, saying they helped Moscow take back control of its Ukraine-controlled Kursk region.",
      "U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have said North Korea sent as many as 12,000 troops to Russia last fall to fight in Kursk, which Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last August. North Korea had not confirmed or denied those reports until now.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the troops\u2019 deployment under a mutual defense pact that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed in June 2024, North Korea\u2019s Central Military Commission said in a statement that was carried by state-run news agency KCNA. The treaty includes a pledge of mutual defense if either country is attacked.",
      "The statement said the operation to regain control of Kursk had been \u201cvictoriously concluded\u201d and that it was \u201can honor to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation.\u201d",

Ukraine denied that Kursk had been retaken, saying its defensive operations are continuing in some areas.",
      "If Russia is confirmed to have retaken Kursk, it would be a blow to Ukraine amid U.S.-led efforts to negotiate an end to the war, which is now in its fourth year. On Saturday, President Donald Trump questioned whether Putin \u2014 who last week launched one of the worst attacks on Ukraine\u2019s major cities since the war began \u2014 was willing to end the war.",
      "In exchange for providing Russia with reinforcements, North Korea gains valuable experience for its military, which has not been deployed overseas since the\u00a0Vietnam War. While North Korean soldiers are fiercely loyal to Kim, experts say their limited exposure to modern warfare leaves them vulnerable on the battlefield, especially against drones.",
      "About 4,000 of the North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured, according to South Korean officials. They said last month that North Korea had sent an additional 3,000 troops to aid Russia\u2019s war effort since the start of this year.",
      "The North Korean statement did not say how many of its troops were sent to Russia in total or how many casualties there have been.",
      "Kim said a monument to their \u201cbattle feats\u201d would be erected in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and that flowers would be placed \u201cbefore the tombstones of the fallen soldiers.\u201d He also said measures should be taken to \u201cpreferentially treat and take care of the families of the brave soldiers who participated in the war.\u201d",
      "The South Korean Ministry of National Defense denounced the North Korean troop deployment and said that by officially announcing it the North had \"effectively admitted to its criminal behavior.\"",
      "\u201cOur military strongly urges North Korea to immediately cease its deceitful and inhumane actions that threaten international peace and force the sacrifice of its residents through illegal military dispatches,\u201d the ministry said Monday.",
      "The deployment of troops to Russia is just part of Kim\u2019s efforts to expand the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military.

      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",

      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",

      "MUSCAT, Oman \u2014 A massive explosion and fire rocked a port Saturday in southern Iran purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, killing at least 40 people and injuring more than 800 others.",
      "Helicopters dumped water from the air on the raging fire hours after the initial explosion, which happened at the Shahid Rajaei port just as Iran and the United States met Saturday in Oman for the third round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "No one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack. However, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \u201cour security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\u201d",
      "Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni gave the casualty figure in an interview on state television. But there were few details on what sparked the blaze just outside of Bandar Abbas, which burned into Saturday night, causing other containers to reportedly explode.",
      "Security firm says port received chemical for missile fuel",
      "The port took in a shipment of \u201csodium perchlorate rocket fuel\u201d in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran\u2019s missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cThe fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\u201d Ambrey said.",
      "Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn\u2019t acknowledged taking the shipment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Saturday.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why Iran wouldn\u2019t have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast \u2014 like in the Beirut explosion.",
      "\u201cGet back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go!\u201d a man in one video shouted just before the blast. \u201cTell him to go, it\u2019s going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!\u201d",
      "On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a \u201cstockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area\u201d for the blast, without elaborating.",
      "An aerial shot released by Iranian media after the blast showed fires burning at multiple locations in the port, with authorities later warning about air pollution from chemicals such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the air. Schools in Bandar Abbas will be closed Sunday as well.",
      "Port a major destination for Iranian cargo",
      "Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran. Israeli officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment regarding Saturday\u2019s explosion.",
      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher.",
      "Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State television also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that it launched an investigation into the blast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offered his condolences for those affected in the blast.",
      "Shahid Rajaei port in Hormozgan province is about 1,050 kilometers 650 miles southeast of Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, on the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes."

      "\u201cThere was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,\u201d the U.S. president wrote in a post on Truth Social, referencing the Russian military strikes in Ukraine this week that killed and wounded dozens of people.",
      "\u201cIt makes me think that maybe he doesn\u2019t want to stop the war, he\u2019s just tapping me along,\u201d Trump added, suggesting that maybe Putin \u201chas to be dealt with differently, through \u2018Banking\u2019 or \u2018Secondary Sanctions?\u2019\u201d",
      "Imposing further sanctions on Russia is an idea that has bipartisan support in the U.S., with a bipartisan group of 50 senators \u2014 25 Democrats and 25 Republicans \u2014 earlier this month introducing a bill that would impose additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "Trump has for weeks been advocating in favor of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and on Friday he hinted that a deal could be close to the finish line, urging Russia and Ukraine to meet for \u201cvery high level\u201d talks. Earlier in the week, Trump had slammed Zelesnkyy for rejecting the terms of any peace deal that would allow Russia to retain control of Crimea, which it annexed against Ukraine\u2019s will in 2014.",
      "In a post on X after meeting with Trump in Rome, Zelenskyy thanked the American president and called the meeting \u201cgood\u201d and \u201csymbolic.\u201d",

      "Trump and Zelenskyy\u2019s meeting in Rome was their first face-to-face interaction since the Ukrainian president\u2019s visit to the White House in February. During that visit, an Oval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance, with Trump and Vance telling Zelenskyy he wasn\u2019t grateful enough for the United States\u2019 continued support in the war.",
      "While in Rome, Zelenskyy also met with European leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, who wrote in French on X that he had a \u201cvery positive exchange today\u201d with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cEnding the war in Ukraine is the goal we share with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for an unconditional ceasefire. President Zelensky reiterated this to me today.

      "Militants armed with rifles had descended on tourists in the meadow from the surrounding woods, identifying non-Muslims and then separating the men from the women and children.",
      "One of the militants \u201cshot six to seven men in front of me,\u201d Kalthia said, before shooting her husband, Shailesh.",
      "\u201cMy husband died in my lap, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she told reporters Thursday at his funeral in their hometown of Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "Twenty-six people were killed in the Tuesday attack, which took place in one of Kashmir\u2019s top tourist destinations, the Baisaran Valley, whose lush green meadows, dense pine forests and snowcapped mountains have led it to be called India\u2019s \u201cmini Switzerland.\u201d",
      "It was the deadliest attack on Indian civilians in almost two decades, and took place while Vice President JD Vance and his family were visiting another part of India. All but one of those killed were Indian nationals; the other was from Nepal.",
      "The attack near the town of Pahalgam in Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is the only Muslim-majority part of India, has devastated the local tourism industry on which many rely for their livelihood. It also undermined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s insistence that the security situation had stabilized after a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",

      "Relations between the two nuclear powers, which both rule parts of Kashmir and have fought two wars over the region, are now at their lowest point in years after tit-for-tat treaty suspensions and the expulsion of diplomats and civilians. On Saturday, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged gunfire for the second day in a row along the Line of Control that divides the two parts of Kashmir.",
      "Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has overseen a crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, vowed retribution for the attack. The family homes of several suspects have been demolished.",

      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the attack was a \u201ccolossal intelligence failure.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help. His hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",

      "\u201cZelenskyy understands that,\u201d Trump said, referring to the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which Russian illegally annexed in 2014. \u201cEverybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time.\u201d",
      "One of Ukraine\u2019s most prominent politicians, Kyiv mayor and former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, has conceded that his country may have to give up territory to Russia if it wants to achieve a peace deal \u2014 a major departure from the policies of his country\u2019s\u00a0president.",

      "The Ukrainian government has repeatedly ruled out relinquishing land to Moscow. That\u2019s left a gulf between its position and that of Russia and the Trump administration, which has been a central force in negotiations to end the war.",
      "The meeting between Putin and Witkoff on Friday came at roughly the same time Zelenskyy said in a post on X that it was \u201cclear\u201d at least one of Russia\u2019s sweeping strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday involved \u201ca ballistic missile from North Korea.\u201d",

      "In a long post Friday, Zelenskyy said that while Ukraine had agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ceasefire 45 days ago, \u201cRussia rejects all of this. That is why this cannot be resolved without pressure. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has often been accused of being more lenient toward Russia than Ukraine, insisted to journalists Thursday that \u201cyou don\u2019t know what pressure I\u2019m putting on Russia\u201d \u2014 without elaborating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said the Kremlin was \u201cready to reach a deal\u201d but that some details needed to be \u201cfine-tuned.\u201d",
