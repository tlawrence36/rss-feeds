      "\u201cWeapons\u201d crawled its way back to the top of the box office during the Labor Day weekend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cWeapons\u201d found its way back on top during the Labor Day weekend, culminating a summer box office that's likely to fall right below meeting last year's earnings.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror proved its staying power as a late-summer viral success and regained the top spot after last weekend saw \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d give Netflix its first box-office win. \u201cWeapons\u201d generated $10.2 million during its fourth weekend in theaters.",
      "Universal\u2019s 50th rerelease of \u201cJaws\u201d also made a splash in theaters, securing the second spot. Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film took \u201ca bite out of the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore, earning $8.1 million in 3,200 North American theaters.",
      "\u201cHow appropriate that a movie that\u2019s celebrating its 50 years, an all-time classic, Jaws, should be as relevant today as it was when it opened,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s so great because we need every dollar to contribute to the bottom line for this summer.\u201d",
      "The rerelease helped boost a summer with earnings likely coming in at $3.7 billion, just under last summer. Still, this year will miss the typical pre-pandemic summer box office benchmark of $4 billion, Dergarabedian said.",
      "\u201cThere were casualties this summer. It\u2019s a very crowded summer, very competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t get to that four billion mark unless every movie just clicked and is performing at or above expectations.\u201d",
      "This summer's earnings were front-loaded, with May releases like \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d becoming box office wins. However, the latter half of the summer struggled despite the success of movies like \u201cWeapons.\"",
      "Dergarabedian said the summer succeeded in provided high-quality movies and marketing, but it's \u201ckind of limping a bit to the finish line in terms of the summer movie season.\u201d",
      "The crime caper \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d starring Austin Butler, generated $7.8 million domestically and snatched third place its debut weekend. Set in 1998 and directed by Darren Aronofsky, the film follows Butler as a New York City bartender who is unexpectedly wrapped up the city's crime world.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d which debuted alongside \u201cWeapons\u201d early this month for a successful humor/horror double feature, took fourth place, earning $6.5 million domestically. \u201cThe Roses,\u201d another newcomer, came in fifth with $6.4 million.",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" landed in sixth place with $4.8 million. The Marvel superhero film hit box office gold during its late July entry, debuting at $118 million. The film, however, experienced a downward trend in earnings since its release.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2\" came in just below \u201cFirst Steps,\u201d with $4.7 million, followed by \u201cSuperman,\u201d an early July entry that generated $2.6 million during the Labor Day weekend.",

      "The film is an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, an account of the Russian President's rise to power alongside a fictional adviser called Vadim Baranov, who is played by Paul Dano. It's partially set in the early 1990s amid post-Soviet chaos.",
      "Dano\u2019s character was inspired by the real political strategist Vladislav Sourkov, who was considered the architect of the tightly controlled political system created under Putin. In 2013, he resigned his post of deputy prime minister.",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d is sure to provoke conversations as Russia\u2019s three-year war in Ukraine continues. Efforts to stop the fighting with a ceasefire and end Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II through a comprehensive peace settlement have made no progress despite intense diplomatic maneuvering.",
      "The film marks the English language debut for the French filmmaker best known for films like \u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d and \u201cPersonal Shopper,\u201d as well as the miniseries \u201cCarlos.\u201d Alicia Vikander, who he directed in \u201cIrma Vep,\u201d also co-stars in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",

      "Assayas wrote in his director\u2019s statement that it, \u201cis not a film about the rise of one man \u2014 nor is it about the force with which power is imposed, or the reinvention of a nation that is both modern and archaic, once again under the yoke of totalitarianism. Rooted in real, contemporary events, it is instead a reflection on modern politics \u2014 or rather, the smoke screens behind which it now hides: cynical, deceptive, and toxic.\u201d",

      "Lee Corso is set to retire from ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on Saturday",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It is rare for a sports broadcasting figure to retire on his own terms or to be able to accept the tributes or adulation of colleagues and fans.",
      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",
      "GameDay\u2019s 26th appearance in Columbus also marks a full-circle moment for Corso. It was outside Ohio Stadium on Oct. 5, 1996, where Corso\u2019s popular headgear prediction segment began.",
      "Corso donned Brutus Buckeye\u2019s head before Ohio State faced Penn State, and the rest is history.",
      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the schedule, the obvious place was to try to go to Tallahassee, where he played (at Florida State), but this game is so big. The fact that it\u2019s a noon game. It became a no-brainer to have it here,\u201d Herbstreit said. \u201cIt is very kind of storybook. The fact that we started with this and and end it here in Columbus.\u201d",
      "Corso has a 66.5% winning rate on his headgear predictions (286-144), which is much better than his 73-85-6 mark in 15 years as a coach at Louisville, Indiana, and Northern Illinois.",
      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",
      "Tom Rinaldi and Chris Fallica \u2014 former GameDay crew members now with Fox Sports \u2014 are also expected to give their thoughts on Corso\u2019s retirement.",

What was he going to do? Like that was going to determine who would win the game or not, but that was the beauty of the show, getting people excited about every Saturday for college football.\u201d",

      "But even though Corso will no longer be a part of Saturday mornings for college football fans, his impact will continue to be felt.",
      "His ability to bring entertainment to a preview show helped get away from seriousness. You can be outrageous and still do your job, but you can still have fun,\u201d Gaiero said. \u201cI think other shows have tried to do that, even political shows.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters is eliminating jobs for more than 500 employees, a Trump administration official said. The move could ratchet up a monthslong legal challenge over the news outlets' fate.",
      "Kari Lake, acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations. His order Monday gave the administration \u201cone final opportunity, short of a contempt trial\u201d to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by Sept. 15.",

      "Lake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees.

The filing said the global media agency had 137 \u201cactive employees\u201d and 62 other employees on administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others administrative leave.",

      "In a five-photo joint post on Instagram on Tuesday, Kelce and Swift revealed their engagement after a courtship that lasted for about two years. The Chiefs did not make Kelce available to reporters this week, and Swift publicist Tree Paine only confirmed that the engagement ring was an old mine brilliant-cut diamond from Kindred Lubeck.",
      "The Chiefs are preparing to play their season-opener against the Chargers next Friday night in Sao Paulo, Brazil.",
      "One of Kelce's best friends, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, also was on hand for the game, perhaps to take in the sight of another No. 15 wearing red and white. Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola has been compared to the three-time Super Bowl MVP ever since taking over in Lincoln, not only because they look similar but because they also were the same jersey.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Amsterdam museum that displays a priceless collection of works by one of the world's most popular artists, Vincent van Gogh, may have to close if the Dutch government doesn't help foot the bill for major repairs to its aging building, the museum's director said Thursday.",
      "Since its opening in 1973, nearly 57 million visitors have passed through the Van Gogh Museum to gaze at iconic works including one of his paintings of a vase of sunflowers as well as \u201cAlmond Blossom,\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d and a colorful depiction of his bedroom in the French town of Arles.",
      "But Director Emilie Gordenker says the original building, which is owned by the Dutch state, is in such poor condition it needs urgent and extensive repairs to keep its priceless collection and visitors safe.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the major maintenance that needs to happen, we will have to close,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The New York Times first reported on her concerns on Wednesday.",
      "She said the 50-year-old building needs \"major maintenance,\u201d and two years of talks with the government have not resolved a dispute about how to pay for repairs expected to start in 2028, last three years and cost 104 million euros ($121 million).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now getting very urgent,\u201d she said.",

      "The dispute has its origins in a decision by Van Gogh\u2019s family to transfer a trove of his art \u2014 more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters along with works by contemporaries such as Paul Gauguin \u2014 to a foundation set up in 1962 to keep the collection together.

      "Darren Aronofsky has already made several indelibly New York movies.

      "That, too, may be a funny way to describe a movie where bodies get brutalized, corpses accumulate and even the cat comes away with a limp. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d a terrific caper starring Austin Butler as a Lower East Side man inadvertently drawn into a nightmarish crime world, is a period movie. It's set in 1998. And no amount of blood can detract from the overwhelming endearment Aronofsky has for '90s New York.",
      "Butler plays Hank Thompson: a former baseball player who can't play anymore; a bartender who, after some of the early events of the movie, can\u2019t drink anymore; and a devoted San Francisco Giants fan surrounded by Mets fans. As his not-quite girlfriend Yvonne ( Zo\u00eb Kravitz ) says, he's \u201ca good country boy\u201d who calls his mom in California every day. They end every call with \u201cGo Giants!\u201d",
      "Hank is far from the first regular guy to be ensnared in underground crime syndicates, but there are a number of things that distinguish \u201cCaught Stealing.\u201d First, his troubles stem, like they do for so many New Yorkers, from his neighbor. Russ (Matt Smith), the mohawked Brit punk who lives next door, rushes out to fly to London, and he leaves Hank his cat to take care of.",
      "Soon, though, a pair of Russian gang skinheads (Yuri Kolokolnikov, Nikita Kukushkin) are banging on Russ' door and quickly after, pummeling Hank, too. Their beating of Hank is unexpectedly brutal, and the first sign that \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d is going for something a little different. When Hank wakes up in the hospital, he's down a kidney and told he can't drink alcohol ever again.",
      "For Hank, it's not his first blush with alcohol-connected fatality. In flashbacks that replay as Hank's nightmares, we see him as a hotshot high-school baseball player, soon to be drafted into the pros. While drinking and driving, he careens off the road to avoid a cow, driving straight into a pole. His buddy is dead, and Hank's knee won't ever be the same.",
      "Meanwhile, the Russian mob interest continues to spiral, drawing in a police detective (Regina King, always good), the skinheads' boss, Colorado (Bad Bunny), and a pair of Orthodox Jewish brothers (Liev Schreiber and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio). The question that keeps coming up is whether Hank can hack it in this world. Is he a killer? He doesn't think so, even though he has killed. As King's detective says, \u201cI thought maybe you played real ball.\u201d",

If it once appeared that Butler might be trapped in his breakthrough role, \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d shows how he can carry a movie in a much less adorned performance.",
      "For Aronofsky, little in his recent filmography ( \"The Whale,\" \u201cMother!\u201d) suggested that an \u201cAfter Hours\u201d-like New York odyssey was coming next from him. It's a little shaggy and you'll occasionally yearn for a bit more humor along the way. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\" based on Charlie Huston's 2004 novel, is a ride, foremost, in '90s nostalgia.",
      "The looming Twin Towers are a regular reminder that this was a long time ago, indeed, even if the New York of Aronofsky's movie seems achingly familiar to some of us. That goes for places the movie rushes past, like Kim's Video and Shea Stadium, the Alphabet City bars of the film and the now-bygone concerns of cell phone minutes running low. Hank has another neighbor, too, whom he and Yvonne mock for how he describes his job as \u201cbuilding websites.\u201d",
      "Late summer is always a funny time in movie theaters, but that goes especially for this year.

These are movies that might not be home runs, but their directors most definitely stretch them for extra bases.",

That we should never let small resentments metastasize or change roles mid-marriage? That we should never, ever get back together?",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, which kicks off on Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of everything you need to know about the festival, the Oscar buzz and who\u2019s going.",
      "It\u2019s one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, second only to Cannes, and technically the oldest. Venice is also a reliably starry affair, gathering some of the best films in international cinema and often factoring into the Oscars race.",
      "The film festival was established in 1932, then a non-competitive event, by the La Biennale di Venezia, hosting films like \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d and \u201cIt Happened One Night.\u201d By 1935, they decided to make it an annual event. Suspicions that the festival was succumbing to fascist influences actually led to the establishment of the Cannes Film Festival, as an alternative, after the 1938 edition.",

      "The festival kicks off on Wednesday and runs through Sept. 6, when the awards will be announced. The opening night film is Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s \u201cLa Grazia.\u201d",
      "Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Emma Stone, Dwayne Johnson, Adam Sandler and Idris Elba are among the stars expected to grace the red carpets this year. It\u2019ll be the first time at the festival for both Roberts, starring in the #MeToo-themed drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d and Johnson, who transformed for his role as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Other stars in the lineup include Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Jesse Plemons, Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Ayo Edebiri, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Colman Domingo, Amanda Seyfried, Callum Turner and Jude Law. Lifetime achievement award recipients this year include \u201cVertigo\u201d star Kim Novak and filmmaker Werner Herzog.",
      "After taking a year off, Netflix, still on the hunt for a best picture win, is back in full force with three major films in the main competition: Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s political thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s comedic drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d Also in competition are: Kaouther ben Hania\u2019s \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d; Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cBugonia,\u201d with Emma Stone; Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d; Jim Jarmusch\u2019s anthology film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d; Mona Fastvold\u2019s musical about the Shakers, \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d; Park Chan-wook\u2019s \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d; and Olivier Assayas\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",
      "The buzz is strong for several out-of-competition films too, like Luca Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d Julian Schnabel\u2019s \u201cIn the Hand of Dante\u201d and Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marc Jacobs documentary \u201cMarc by Sofia.\u201d",

      "A military outpost in the 12th century, it transformed into a seaside resort, a favorite of European aristocrats, by the end of the 19th.",
      "On the Lido, the only five-star hotel is the Hotel Excelsior, which dates back to 1908 and is where Quentin Tarantino has stayed. But rooms go quickly, and there are so many luxury hotels on the different islands that offer a bit more privacy, away from the frenzy of the festival and photographers.",
      "Perhaps the most famous of the bunch is the Belmond Hotel Cipriani, on Giudecca, home of one of Clooney\u2019s favorite bars. There\u2019s the Hotel Danieli, which has been featured in films like \u201cMoonraker\u201d and \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d and regularly hosts kickoff parties for the festival. Another favorite is the Gritti Palace, where everyone from Brad Pitt to Elizabeth Taylor has stayed. There\u2019s also a St. Regis and the Aman Venice, where George and Amal Clooney were married.",
      "The scattered hotels are also the reason you see so many celebrities photographed on the Excelsior docks: They arrive to the festival, including press conferences and premieres, by private water taxi. Sometimes, they\u2019re transported a very short distance from the Excelsior to the red carpet in cars. Unlike the main island of Venice, vehicles are allowed on the Lido, including buses and private cars. But many festivalgoers prefer to rent a bike to get around.",
      "\u201cNebraska\u201d filmmaker Alexander Payne is presiding over the main competition jury, which includes Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Chinese actor Zhao Tao and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu.

      "Guillermo del Toro rose to fame creating horror movies that will likely help shape the genre for generations to come",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Many fled when wildfires devastated Los Angeles earlier this year, but Guillermo del Toro rushed back in, determined to save his lifelong collection of horror memorabilia.",
      "It's the same loyalty that finds him making another tough decision to protect the items he loves like family: letting some of them go.",
      "Del Toro partnered with Heritage Auctions for a three-part auction to sell a fraction of a collection that is bursting at the seams. Online bidding for the first part on Sept. 26 started Thursday and includes over a hundred items, with more headed to the auction block next year.",
      "\u201cThis one hurts. The next one, I\u2019m going to be bleeding,\u201d del Toro, 60, said of the auction series. \u201cIf you love somebody, you have estate planning, you know, and this is me estate planning for a family that has been with me since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "Del Toro is one of the industry\u2019s most respected filmmakers, whose fascination with monsters and visual style will shape generations to come. But at his core, the Mexican-born horror buff is a collector. The Oscar-winner has long doubled as the sole caretaker of the \u201cBleak House\u201d \u2014 which stretches across two and a half Santa Monica homes nearly overflowing with thousands of ghoulish creatures, iconic comic drawings and paintings, books and movie props.",
      "The houses function not just as museums, but as libraries and workspaces where his imagination bounces off the oxblood-painted walls.",
      "\u201cI love what I have because I live with it. I actually am a little nuts, because I say hi to some of the life-size figures when I turn on the light,\u201d del Toro told The Associated Press, sitting in the dining room of one of the houses, now a sanctuary for \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d memorabilia. \u201cThis is curated. This is not a casual collection.\u201d",
      "The auction includes behind-the-scene drawings and one-of-a-kind props from del Toro\u2019s own classics, as well as iconic works like Bernie Wrightson\u2019s illustrations for \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Mike Mignola\u2019s pinup artwork for \u201cHellraiser.\u201d",
      "In January, del Toro had only a couple hours, his car and a few helping hands to save key pieces from the fires. Out of the over 5,000 items in his collection, he only managed to move about 120 objects. It wasn't the first time, as fires had come dangerously close to Bleak House twice before.",
      "The houses were spared, but fear consumed him. If a fire or earthquake swallowed them, he thought, \u201cWhat came out of it? You collected insurance? And what happened to that little segment of Richard Corben's life, or Jack Kirby\u2019s craft, or Bernie Wrightson\u2019s life?\u201d",
      "An auction, del Toro said, gives him peace of mind, as it ensures the items will land in the hands of another collector who will protect the items as he has. These are not just props or trinkets, he said, but \u201chistorical artifacts. They're pieces of audiovisual history for humanity.\u201d And his life's mission has been to protect as much of this history as he can.",
      "\u201cLook, this is in reaction to the fires. This is in reaction to loving this thing,\u201d del Toro told the AP.",
      "The initial auction uncovers who del Toro is as a collector, he said. Upcoming parts will expose how the filmmaker thinks, which he called a much more personal endeavor. The auction isn't just a \u201cpiece of business,\u201d for him, but rather a love letter to collectors everywhere, and encouragement to think beyond a movie and \u201clearn to read and write film design in a different way. That's my hope.\u201d",

      "It started with a friendship bracelet",
      "NEW YORK -- It started with a friendship bracelet. It ended with an engagement ring. Taylor Swift, the pop superstar, and Travis Kelce, the football champion, are engaged.",
      "The fiances, both 35, announced the news in a joint post on Instagram on Tuesday. It is the latest chapter in the couple's love story, one that has spanned two years, two Super Bowls, an album announcement and the highest-grossing tour of all time.",
      "Here is a look at some of the major events in their relationship.",
      "It started, fittingly, with a friendship bracelet.",
      "It was way back in July 2023 that Kelce attended Swift\u2019s Eras concert at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs play.",
      "After, on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast with brother Jason Kelce, he professed to being disappointed \u2014 well, his word was \u201cbutthurt\u201d \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t meet Swift and present her with a bracelet with his phone number on it.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal,\u201d he quipped. The podcast asked on Instagram: \u201cAnyone know how to get a bracelet to @taylorswift13? \u2026 asking for a friend.\u201d",
      "But by that September, Kelce was hinting his efforts had achieved some success. He declined to elaborate amid speculation, telling an interviewer: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d",
      "Clearly, though, something was happening. Soon, Kelce revealed he\u2019d invited Swift to a game at Arrowhead. \u201cI threw the ball in her court,\u201d he said on another talk show.",
      "Swift took Kelce up on his offer, appearing for all the world to see at the Chiefs-Bears game, cheering next to his mom, Donna Kelce. The two left the stadium in Kelce\u2019s purple Chevelle \u201cgetaway car\u201d \u2014 forgive the pun, but Kelce himself used it.",
      "\u201cPretty ballsy,\u201d Kelce said a few days later of Swift\u2019s appearance, adding how much he loved seeing her cheer next to his mother.",
      "It was the launch of a long series of appearances by Swift at Chiefs games. There was some online angst over whether Swift was distracting from football \u2014 while the NFL itself capitalized on her fandom. A day after the flashy Los Angeles premiere of her \u201cTaylor Swift: Eras Tour\u201d movie, she was back at Arrowhead.",
      "And now it was time for Kelce to be the adoring fan. In November 2023, after a hiatus of two months, Swift brought her tour to Argentina, where she changed the lyrics of \u201cKarma\u201d to salute her beau. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang. Scott Swift, next to a beaming Kelce, applauded his daughter\u2019s new flame.",
      "When Time magazine announced its person of the year, few were surprised. In the Time interview, Swift spoke about her relationship.",
      "\u201cThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\u201d Swift said, adding that they\u2019d already been a couple before that first Chiefs game cameo.",
      "Soon after, things were heating up on the football field \u2014 meaning the Chiefs were heading to the Super Bowl. At the AFC championship game, the couple made it clear they were fine with whatever attention was coming their way. In the middle of the field in Baltimore, after the Chiefs beat the Ravens, Swift and Kelce kissed. \u201cI love you,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cSo much it\u2019s not funny.\u201d",
      "There was one game left. Fans wondered: How would Swift make it from her Tokyo shows to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas?",
      "\u201cThis week is truly the best kind of chaos,\u201d Swift posted on Instagram.",
      "Chaos indeed. In one week of February 2024, Swift attended the Grammys in Los Angeles, jetted to Tokyo for four concerts, then jumped back onto her private plane to make the Super Bowl with time to spare. To get there, she crossed nine time zones and the international dateline.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s rewriting the history books herself,\u201d Kelce said a day after the Grammys, where Swift had won album of the year for a record fourth time. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home with hardware, too.\u201d",
      "And he did. The two kissed on the field again after the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers, Swift in her \u201c87\u201d necklace.",

      "Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen. He doesn\u2019t even remember a time in his life when he wasn\u2019t aware of his music. But sing his songs? It wasn\u2019t until White began preparing to play the rock \u2019n' roll legend for \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d that he even tried.",
      "\u201cI had never really sang anything, never mind Bruce,\u201d White says. \u201cThere was a leap of faith that we were all taking.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s an established playbook for music biopics. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d ignored all of it. The film, written and directed by Scott Cooper (\u201cCrazy Heart,\u201d \u201cBlack Mass\u201d), eschews the standard life-spanning, play-the-hits approach and instead focuses on a small portion of Springsteen\u2019s sprawling life: the making of his 1982 album, \u201cNebraska.\u201d",
      "The album, a minimalist masterpiece recorded on a four track in Springsteen\u2019s bedroom in Colts Neck, New Jersey, doesn\u2019t lend itself to anything like a glossy big-screen jukebox. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d instead, is aimed more at the soul of Springsteen. For the role, Cooper turned to who he considers one of the best actors of his generation \u2014 even though he had no singing experience.",
      "\u201cI remember early on speaking to Scott about the project and being really excited to do it with him but also telling him, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know how to play the guitar and I\u2019ve never really sang before. Are we going to be able to figure out this together?\u2019\u201d White recalls. \u201cBut Scott had faith. And Bruce had faith. And we trusted each other.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d which 20th Century Studios will release Oct. 24 in theaters, is the first movie based on Springsteen\u2019s life. It was made with Springsteen\u2019s involvement; he gave input to on the script, on casting and attended several days on set. It\u2019s also the first leading movie role for White, the 34-year-old Emmy-winning star of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d who sings all the songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI knew that he had the two qualities that really embody Bruce: humility and swagger,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t teach swagger at Julliard. You either have it or you don\u2019t. I was never concerned. He\u2019s sensational.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d based on Warren Zanes\u2019 2023 book, co-stars Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau, Springsteen\u2019s longtime manager and record producer. Landau was also involved in the project from its inception.",
      "\u201cI knew that this was the first time Bruce had handed the wheel over to anybody to tell a story of his,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey were never directors in any way but were always there when I had a question. Of course, when you\u2019re Jeremy Allen White and you have Bruce Springsteen show up, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u201d",
      "For White, Springsteen was a great resource in a movie that aspired to authentic interiority. \u201cNebraska\u201d was a major departure for Springsteen. Its 10 songs spun tales of blue-collar workers soaked through with Springsteen\u2019s own childhood memories and reverberating with an American storytelling tradition running from Flannery O\u2019Connor to Woody Guthrie. Springsteen intended the raw demos to be later recorded with the E Street Band, but ultimately decided to release the unvarnished recordings.",
      "White sees the film, in part, as about the artistic process.",
      "\u201cHe was drawing inspiration from all these places but he didn\u2019t really know what he was doing for a while with this record,\u201d White says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a record. As an actor, hopefully you\u2019re doing that sort of thing all the time. That artistic curiosity is something I related to.\u201d",
      "White first spent time with Springsteen in London, where he also attended a concert. The actor later spoke to Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's bandmate and wife of 34 years, and friends of the rock legend. After peppering Springsteen with questions during preproduction in New Jersey, White says he mostly kept his head down during the shoot.",

      "The challenge musically was considerable. To prepare, White worked with vocal coach Eric Vetro (who a also trained Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d ), guitar instructor J.D. Simo and music supervisor Dave Cobb.

And I got to sing Bruce\u2019s songs over and over again. I remember feeling closer and closer to the man.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cAtlantic City\u201d was initially the song White gravitated toward, the one that ended up striking a chord was \u201cMy Father\u2019s House,\u201d one of Springsteen\u2019s most stirring and plaintive ballads.",

All of his morals are right in line \u2014 what I consider to be right in line.\u201d",
      "Says Cooper: \u201cBruce isn\u2019t just a musician. He\u2019s the symbol of something that\u2019s uniquely American. The blue-collar poet. The reluctant moral conscience. I think to make a film about Bruce is to make a film about America\u2019s soul. The power of that lies in his emotional honesty and his work resonates across all political lines because he tells the truth.\u201d",
      "Cooper wasn\u2019t just speaking theoretically. Making \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d coincided with multiple tragedies for the director. His father died the day before shooting began. During the last week of production, he lost his house in the Palisades fire in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cJeremy and Bruce and a really wonderful crew and cast of actors lifted me up and carried me through to the finish line,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cWhen we didn\u2019t have a place to live, Bruce moved my family into his place in Los Angeles. And Jeremy was there on some of my darkest days. The movie, for me, has a particular resonance.\u201d",

      "The firing of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the resignation of several high-profile agency leaders pose immediate challenges to the operations of the nation's premiere public health agency, experts said.",
      "It could take \u201cseveral months\u201d to identify and confirm a replacement for CDC Director Susan Monarez, who was terminated Wednesday after less than a month on the job, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, director of the American Public Health Association. And it could take more time to fill at least four key vacated positions that oversee disease outbreaks, vaccines and public health data.",
      "\u201cThe whole chain of command has just been disrupted,\u201d Benjamin told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's like getting rid of your generals in the middle of a war.\u201d",
      "Health experts said Americans could see immediate effects, from confusion over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines to delayed responses to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles or foodborne illnesses caused by germs such as E. coli or listeria.",
      "\u201cThe average American should worry about their safety and their health and whether information coming out of Health and Human Services is reliable or trustworthy,\u201d said Dr. Anne Schuchat, former principal deputy director of the CDC, who left the agency in 2021.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the sudden changes at the CDC.",
      "The White House ousted Monarez on Wednesday after apparent clashes between the CDC director and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes to the nation's vaccine policy.",
      "Officials at the White House said Monarez was dismissed because she was not aligned with President Donald Trump's agenda and refused to resign.",
      "That action coincided with the resignation this week of at least four top CDC agency leaders: Dr. Debra Houry, the agency\u2019s deputy director; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, leader of the agency\u2019s work on emerging infectious diseases; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a top vaccine official; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, who led public health data efforts.",
      "Monarez was the first CDC director to require Senate confirmation under a law that took effect in 2023. Replacing her would require Trump to nominate a new director, who would then need to be considered and confirmed by the Senate. On Thursday, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said the high-profile departures will \u201crequire oversight\u201d of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs.",
      "In the meantime, the president could name an acting CDC director, Benjamin noted.",
      "Replacing the leaders in the other positions, including those who held the jobs for years, will be difficult, Schuchat said.",
      "\u201cThe four people who resigned led important parts of the agency and had the respect of the nation and the world,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cSo we need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there\u2019s really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump\u2019s broad ambitions.\u201d",
      "The clash at CDC was apparently triggered by conflict over changes in policy regarding recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations that could make getting a shot more complicated for people.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 shots on Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children. The new jabs from three manufacturers are approved for all seniors, but the FDA narrowed their use for adults and children to those with high-risk health conditions, such as asthma or obesity.",
      "The FDA approval is typically reviewed by a CDC vaccine advisory committee, which makes recommendations for use. Monarez said she would not automatically sign off on recommendations of the committee, which was handpicked by Kennedy, according to Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC acting director. (Besser is now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which helps support The Associated Press Health and Science Department.)",
      "The changes present new barriers to access for millions of Americans, who would have to prove their risk, and others who may want the shots but suddenly no longer qualify. The vaccines were previously recommended for Americans 6 months and older.",
      "\u201cThese decisions, made without supporting evidence, reflect a troubling pattern by HHS of interfering in the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers and limiting access to vaccines \u2014 public health tools proven to save lives and reduce costs,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "In addition, the disruption at the CDC could jeopardize many local health services undergirded by the agency's support and expertise, Schuchat noted. That could mean tracking a simmering infectious disease outbreak, such as measles, or outbreaks of foodborne illness.",
      "\u201cIt's the water that you drink, the lead in your pipes. Look around your community,\" she said. \u201cIf people are doing well and healthy, it's probably partly because of the CDC.\u201d",

      "Nearly 150 Inuit women last year sued Denmark and filed compensation claims against its health ministry, saying Danish health authorities violated their human rights when they fitted them with intrauterine contraceptive devices, or IUDs. The devices, fitted in the uterus, prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.",
      "Some of the women \u2014 including many who were teenagers at the time \u2014 were not aware of what happened or did not give their consent. Danish authorities last year said as many as 4,500 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half of the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s.",
      "The alleged purpose was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care.",
      "The governments' apology, issued in a joint statement, comes ahead of a report expected next month and related to an investigation into the mistreatment.",

The program also offers families the option to purchase a combination of food \u2013 the same as what's distributed to schools \u2013 monthly. However, most of the two dozen people in Falcon who spoke to AP said they'd not received the food since the spring.",

WFP prioritized Falcon, with its massive sand dunes and mountain ranges that reach the Caribbean Sea, due to the population's particular problems with food insecurity.",
      "But citing funding challenges, the WFP this year has deeply cut its aid in Venezuela \u2014 Falcon included \u2014 and beyond.

      "The extent of hunger across the country is somewhat unknown. Dr. Huniades Urbina, a pediatrician and former director of Venezuela\u2019s largest public children\u2019s hospital, said that's in part because government-run hospitals have banned personnel from including malnutrition in patients\u2019 medical histories.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall and winter season",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children.",
      "The new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed their use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity. That presents new barriers to access for millions of Americans who\u2019d have to prove their risk -- and millions more who may want to get vaccinated and suddenly no longer qualify.",
      "Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine will no longer be available for any child underage 5, after the FDA said it was revoking the shot\u2019s emergency authorization for that age group.",
      "Parents will still be able to seek out shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company\u2019s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.",
      "The revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they\u2019ll be able to get one, with access dependent on various decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.",
      "The new restrictions \u2014 previewed by FDA officials in May \u2014 are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.",
      "The approach reflects heightened skepticism about the ongoing risks of COVID-19 and the need for yearly booster shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who were both outspoken critics of wide-scale vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThe American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,\u201d Kennedy wrote on social media.",
      "Kenned said Novavax's shot is only open to people 12 or older, not younger children \u2013 and under the same risk-based restrictions as are now in place for the Moderna and Pfizer options. It's the nation's only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "Some medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have objected to the new limits, saying they may block vaccine access for families who want to protect their children. Last week, the group offered its own recommendations for kids, saying annual COVID shots are strongly recommended for children ages 6 months to 2 years and advised for older children.",
      "That differs from the latest guidance under Kennedy, which doesn\u2019t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age, but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Many countries have scaled back COVID-19 vaccinations in recent years, and some U.S. experts say the change makes sense here, given that nearly all Americans have some protection from previous vaccination or infection.",
      "But implementing the shift presents a number of logistical problems.",
      "Insurers typically base their vaccine coverage decisions on the recommendations of a panel of advisers to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some say they will also look to medical professional groups, including the American Medical Association.",
      "Earlier this year, Kennedy dissolved the CDC panel and replaced its members with a number of doctors and researchers who have repeatedly questioned the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients. The panel is expected to meet in September, but no specific date has been set and no agenda released.",
      "Depending on the panel\u2019s advice, Americans underage 65 could be expected to provide documentation of a serious medical condition before they can get a shot. Complicating the rollout is the fact that pharmacists \u2014 who administer most COVID vaccines in the U.S. \u2014 typically aren\u2019t expected to collect that kind of information. And laws governing their ability to administer routine vaccinations vary by state, where pharmacists are licensed.",

They might also have to find a doctor or other health professional willing to give the shot \u201coff label,\u201d or outside the use listed on the FDA label. Pharmacists may be reluctant to give vaccines off-label.",
      "The updated shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax target a coronavirus subtype named LP. 8.1, a recently dominant version of the virus that is closely related to some newly emerging cousins.",
      "All three shots were initially made available under the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization, an expedited process to quickly review vaccines and other countermeasures during the pandemic.",
      "Moderna received full FDA approval in July for children down to 6 months and says it should have enough supply to meet U.S. demand.",
      "In addition to revoking emergency use of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, the FDA also pulled authorization for several other therapies from the pandemic years, including convalescent plasma, which was used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients before the first antiviral drugs became available.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors say Luigi Mangione, accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on a Manhattan sidewalk, has inspired others to embrace violence over reasoned debate.",
      "As evidence of Mangione's growing influence, prosecutors cited the last month's deadly mass shooting at the National Football League headquarters.",
      "The prosecution outlined the threat in a filing late Wednesday on a procedural matter in federal court in Manhattan, where they plan to try to convince a jury that Mangione deserves death. No federal trial date has been set.",
      "Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges, was arrested five days after the Dec. 4 killing of CEO Brian Thompson. He is being held without bail in a federal jail in Brooklyn.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for \u201can act of political violence\u201d and a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "In their filing Wednesday, prosecutors wrote that Mangione poses a continuing danger in part because he seeks to influence others.",
      "\u201cSimply put, the defendant hoped to normalize the use of violence to achieve ideological or political objectives,\u201d they said. \u201cSince the murder, certain quarters of the public \u2014 who openly identify as acolytes of the defendant \u2014 have increasingly begun to view violence as an acceptable, or even necessary, substitute for reasoned political disagreement.\u201d",
      "In a footnote, prosecutors referenced the gunman who went into an office building not far from where Thompson was shot in midtown Manhattan, then killed four people including an off-duty police officer, a financial services firm executive and a security guard, and wounded others, including an NFL employee.",

      "Crossing paths with dogs, cats and other animals is part of campus life for students at Eckerd College, a liberal arts school in Florida that allows pets to live in dormitories.",
      "Sophie Nocera, an Eckerd senior, said she probably knows the names of pets better than her fellow students.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the case for a lot of the students,\" said Nocera, who lives on the campus in St. Petersburg with her Border collie, Zuko. \"When I'm walking my dog, I often hear, \u2018Oh my god, hi, Zuko!\u2019 It's like I\u2019m not even there.\"",
      "Some colleges and universities around the country welcome pets in campus residences, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stephens College in Missouri.",
      "For students, the companionship can help reduce stress, anxiety and homesickness. The colleges also see benefits for student engagement and helping them build connections with one another.",
      "Federal law requires public and private colleges to allow service animals and emotional support animals in student housing. But growing numbers of schools are allowing pets, with various restrictions.",
      "MIT allows only cats, in limited numbers and in preapproved spaces. At Eckerd, students can bring their family pets to live with them on campus after their first semester. The college requires pets to have been part of students\u2019 home life at least six months before coming to campus and must not be venomous or aggressive.",
      "At the University of Northern Colorado, students in three of the more than dozen residence halls on campus are allowed to have dogs and cats. The animals must be at least 6 months old and no more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms). Students are limited to one pet. This fall, the school will have the most registered pets on campus since it began allowing them over a decade ago, said Jediah Cummins, executive director of housing.",

And, we\u2019re going to go play fetch regardless of what my major is,\" said Nocera, who is the staff director of Pet Life, a student-led department on campus tasked with administering the pet policy.",
      "At Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Eva Chatterjee-Sutton saw the difference a pet can make when a first-year student was struggling to make connections before her mother suggested a puppy. After the dog's arrival, the student became more involved in campus life, said Chatterjee-Sutton, vice president of student life.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely changed her college trajectory and her connection with others on campus,\u201d Chatterjee-Sutton said.",
      "Pet-friendly dorms require colleges to consider things like safety concerns, noise complaints, how to avoid agitating animals during fire alarm tests, as well as additional costs for cleaning, Layden said. Some schools charge a pet fee, which varies by school, type of pet and is often included in housing expenses. For example, at Stephens College, the annual fee for a dog or cat is $220, for a cage- or aquarium-dwelling pet is $50 and free for fish. Others require students to have liability insurance and roommate agreements. Pets are required to be restrained when in public, and most colleges require students to ensure their pets are healthy and vaccinated.",

He said judges elected by the people would be more accountable and less corrupt. Critics said electing judges risked politicizing the judiciary.",

Damage was estimated at 20 million Brazilian reais (about $3.7 million). Maximum prison sentence: three years.",

      "A majority of three votes is enough to convict.",
      "For those found guilty, each justice can recommend a sentence. If the recommendations differ, a single justice will determine an average of the prison time and possible fines.",
      "Bolsonaro and the other defendants can appeal to the full Supreme Court, which would mean their cases would be analyzed by the six justices who are not on the panel.",
      "If the appeal is accepted, the full court won't retry the entire case. Instead, it will only review specific complaints on conflicting rulings by the panel, for example on whether a conviction in a specific count should stand or on the length of prison time.",
      "If a majority of the full Supreme Court upholds the conviction, then Bolsonaro will go to prison. But it is unlikely he would be transferred to a regular prison. As a former Army captain, he has the right to special incarceration, which could take place at the Army\u2019s headquarters in Brasilia or the Federal Police\u2019s main building in the same city.",

      "South Korea\u2019s former first lady Kim Keon Hee and former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo have been indicted as part of investigations into the administration of ousted President Yoon Suk-Yeol and his attempt to overcome opposition by declaring martial law",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The wife of South Korea's jailed ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol and his former prime minister were indicted Friday as part of investigations into his administration and his attempt to overcome opposition by declaring martial law.",
      "Yoon set off South Korea\u2019s most serious political crisis in decades when he attempted to force his agenda through an opposition-dominated legislature by declaring martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. It lasted only hours but triggered months of turmoil that paralyzed politics, disrupted foreign policy and rattled the economy.",
      "Yoon was impeached, then removed from office in April and rearrested last month after his conservative party lost the presidency in an early election. The new government has appointed three special prosecutors to investigate both the period of martial law and suspicions of corruption that dogged Yoon through his term in office.",
      "A team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki said it charged Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, with violating financial market and political funding laws and receiving bribes, about two weeks after a court ordered her arrest.",
      "A separate team led by Special Prosecutor Cho Eun-suk said former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was charged with abetting Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law, which investigators say amounted to a rebellion, as well as falsifying and destroying official documents, and lying under oath.",
      "Dozens of people have been arrested or investigated over Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle, corruption allegations involving his wife, and other controversies from his three years in office, including an alleged cover-up of a marine\u2019s drowning death during a 2023 flood rescue operation.",
      "Key suspects include former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of planning martial law with Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly in an unsuccessful attempt to block lawmakers from voting to lift it. More than 60 people were separately indicted for rioting at a Seoul court which issued the warrant for Yoon\u2019s first arrest in January.",
      "Assistant special counsel Park Ji-young told a televised briefing that Han was the highest official who could have blocked Yoon\u2019s attempt to impose martial law. Park said Han still played an \u201cactive\u201d role in Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration by trying to get Yoon\u2019s decree passed through a Cabinet Council meeting as a way to give \u201cprocedural legitimacy\u201d to it.",
      "Han has maintained he conveyed to Yoon that he opposed his martial law plan.",
      "Cho\u2019s team earlier requested the Seoul Central District Court to issue a warrant to arrest Han. But the court on Wednesday dismissed that request, saying it determined that there were little chances that Han would flee or destroy evidence.",
      "While Yoon\u2019s self-inflicted downfall extended a lengthy streak of South Korean presidencies ending badly, he and Kim are the first former presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously over criminal allegations.",

      "Kim and Yoon are suspected of exerting undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a favored candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Myung is accused of conducting free opinion surveys for Yoon that used manipulated data, possibly helping him win the party\u2019s presidential primaries before his election as president.",
      "Kim apologized for causing public concern earlier this month but also hinted she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as \u201csomeone insignificant.\u201d",
      "In a statement released through her lawyers on Friday, Kim didn\u2019t make specific comments about her charges, but said the media was reporting suspicions as though they were \u201cconfirmed fact\u201d and that she plans to \u201cquietly attend the trials.\u201d",
      "Han, who was appointed prime minister, the country\u2019s No. 2 post, by Yoon, was South Korea\u2019s acting leader after Yoon was impeached in mid-December.",
      "After Yoon was formally dismissed as president in a Constitutional Court decision, Han was supposed to continue to head the caretaker government until the June presidential election, but resigned to seek his party\u2019s presidential nomination. He failed to win the nomination.",

      "In Spokane, KSPS has always tried to keep its requests for member donations separate from appeals for public funding. Not anymore. Congress left the station with a $1.2 million hole to fill, about 18% of its budget, and the station is using that as a pretext to seek help from listeners.",
      "\u201cWe have definitely seen some attrition from our Canadian members,\u201d said Skyler Reep, the station's interim general manager.",
      "Long suspicious of a liberal bent to public media news coverage, Republicans in Congress responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes in July and eliminated funding for the systems. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes the funding, has taken steps to shut down.",
      "In some parts of the country, the answer to pleas for help have exceeded expectations. Public radio station WHQR in Wilmington, N.C. raised more than $200,000 in three days, filling a $174,000 hole and then some. It's a small community growing fast with an influx of retirees, many who depend on the station's news to learn about their new home, said general manager Kevin Crane.",
      "With $525,000 gone from its budget, Hawaii Public Radio has already raised $650,000 in an emergency fund drive. \u201cIt's a validation that what you're doing is essential to the community and is appreciated by the community,\u201d said Meredith Artley, president and CEO. The 2023 wildfires in Maui and their aftermath were covered steadily by Hawaii Public Radio news reporters.",
      "\u201cThe initial response in terms of support for both stations and the NPR network has been extraordinary,\u201d said Katherine Maher, NPR president. \u201cPeople did a lot of work leading up to the vote, in actions and calls. When that did not prove convincing, they turned to direct support.\u201d",
      "Stations across the country have stories that make them smile: the youngster from Florida who collected money for public stations in Alaska, sending a note written in crayon; the regular $300 donor who came in to PBS SoCal with a $100,000 check, one of three six-figure donations the station has received.",
      "Most stations aren't in areas with so many wealthy donors. Most station managers are like Jeff Hanks of PBS' LPTV in Lakeland, Minnesota. He lies awake wondering where he will find $1 million to pay for things like his station's nightly newscast, a primary news source for central and northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThese are extremely, extremely challenging times,\u201d Hanks said. \u201cWe're fighting hard every way we can.\u201d",
      "He knows membership donations won't make up for what is missing. Both PBS and NPR have taken steps to reduce the annual dues that stations pay for programming and other services. At PBS, it's an average 15% reduction, but needy stations get more \u2014 in one case, more than half of next year's dues will be forgiven, said PBS president Paula Kerger.",
      "NPR is encouraging donors in wealthier areas to adopt stations in poorer ones, perhaps in an area where a contributor has emotional ties.",
      "Public media leaders are also working with a group of philanthropists led by the Knight and MacArthur foundations that is hoping to raise some $50 million to support stations in areas hardest hit be the cuts. Ed Ulman, president and CEO of Alaska Public Media, which represents nearly two dozen radio and television stations in the largest state, said he'll be seeking money from this fund.",
      "Ulman said he's been buoyed by the response from Alaskans in their effort to raise $15 million through various sources by October. The services their stations provide is free, and citizens see its value.",

    "story": [
      "Fire departments are increasingly switching to gear that doesn\u2019t contain potentially cancer-causing chemicals",
      "EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Every time he rushed out on a fire call, East Providence Lt. Thomas Votta knew he put himself at risk for cancer. There are potential carcinogens in the smoke billowing out of a house fire, but also risks from wearing his chemically-treated gear.",
      "Last month, the Rhode Island fire department became the nation's first to give the 11-year veteran and all his 124 fellow firefighters new gear free of PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.",
      "Known as forever chemicals because of how long they remain in the environment, PFAS have been linked to a host of health problems, including increased risk of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and babies born with low birth weights.",
      "\u201cWe are exposed to so many chemicals when we go to fires,\u201d Votta said. \u201cHaving it inside our gear, touching or very close to our skin was very, very concerning. Knowing that\u2019s gone now, it gives us a little bit of relief. We\u2019re not getting it from every angle.\u201d",
      "The PFAS in the multilayered coats and pants \u2014 primarily meant to repel water and contaminants like oil and prevent moisture-related burns \u2014 have been a growing concern among firefighters for several years.",
      "Cancer has replaced heart disease as the biggest cause of line-of-duty deaths, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, the union that represents firefighters and EMS workers. Firefighters are at higher risk than the general population of getting skin, kidney and other types of cancer, according to a study led by the American Cancer Society.",
      "Firefighters are exposed to smoke from faster and hotter blazes in buildings and wildfires, many containing toxic chemicals like arsenic and asbestos. In addition to the PFAS in their gear, the IAFF is also concerned about firefighting foam that contains the chemical and is being phased out in many places.",
      "\u201cThe question that is obvious to us is that why would we have carcinogens intentionally infused into our personal protective equipment?\u201d IAFF General President Edward Kelly, who was elected in 2021 in part on a campaign to address PFAS dangers, said at a news conference this month.",
      "It can be difficult to determine the cause of a firefighter's cancer since the disease can take years to develop and genetics, diet and other lifestyle factors can play a role, experts say. Where a firefighter works \u2014 cities, suburbs or rural areas \u2014 also can impact the level of exposure to toxins.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s good they\u2019re shining a light on the health of their workers,\u201d said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director at the Cancer Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic at Mass General Hospital.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the data is mature enough that we have a clear understanding of what the unique causes of cancer in firefighters might be that\u2019s different from the general population.\u201d",
      "Still, health concerns among firefighters have sparked a flurry of lawsuits against makers of gear and PFAS chemicals. Seven states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have passed laws banning PFAS in gear and two others introduced bills calling for bans, according to the IAFF.",
      "The union has also targeted the agency that sets voluntary standards for firefighting gear and other safety requirements. In a 2023 lawsuit, the union accused the National Fire Protection Association, or NFPA, of setting standards that can only be met with PFAS-treated material and working with several gear makers to maintain that requirement \u2014 something the association denied.",
      "Last year, the agency announced new standards restricting use of 24 classes of chemicals including PFAS in gear \u2014 though it is considering delaying the law until March to give companies more time to comply.",
      "\u201cThe development of this new standard marks the most significant and complex shift in how firefighter protective gear is made in a generation,\" said NFPA spokesperson Tom Lyons.",
      "Amid the state bans and legal fights, some of the largest gear makers are shifting away from PFAS. Smaller companies have also emerged marketing what they claim is PFAS-free gear. Hydrocarbon wax or silicone-based finish often replaces PFAS in the outer shell and removes it from the middle, moisture barrier.",

      "\u201cThe biggest challenge has been trust \u2014 or more accurately, the lack of it,\u201d said Matthew Alba, a San Francisco department battalion chief who is being treated for a brain tumor he blames on fighting wildfires.",
      "In Quincy, Massachusetts, the department bought what it thought were 30 sets of PFAS-free gear, but independent tests revealed the chemical's presence.",
      "\u201cThese last few months dealing with this issue has been frustrating, angry and truthfully sad seeing what these companies continue to pull,\u201d Tom Bowes, president of the IAFF local, told a news conference attended by dozens of Quincy firefighters this month.",
      "Researchers at Duke and North Carolina State universities argue concerns over the new gear suggest the transition away from PFAS has been rushed \u2014 potentially exposing firefighters to new chemicals and giving them gear that hasn't been proven safe.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve talked to fire chiefs, fire departments across the country, across the world, they\u2019re all dealing with it,\u201d said Bryan Ormond, a professor at North Carolina State and director of its Milliken Textile Protection and Comfort Center. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to figure out ... how to move forward safely and protect our people because we don\u2019t necessarily know what the new gear is going to do.\"",
      "But Graham Peaslee, an emeritus professor at the University of Notre Dame who tested gear for San Francisco and Quincy and is working with five other departments, said concerns about PFAS-free gear were a \u201cscare tactic\u201d from the chemical companies that want to keep selling their products.",
      "In East Providence, testing showed the fire department's first attempt to buy PFAS-free gear contained flame retardants that pose increased cancer risk and didn't adequately protect from heat. A new supplier provided PFAS-free materials that offered the heat protection.",
      "\u201cIt's a home run,\u201d Fire Chief Michael Carey said of the gear, which cost $658,000 and was paid for by pandemic funds.",
      "\u201cIt takes a sizable weight off of my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about them being in that gear and being exposed to a known carcinogen.\u201d",

      "The Transportation Department has canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department on Friday canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects, the latest attack by the Trump administration on the reeling U.S. offshore wind industry.",
      "Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.",
      "\u201cWasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America\u2019s maritime industry,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \u201cThanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.",
      "President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy\u2019s action \u201coutrageous\u201d and deeply disappointing.",
      "Trump and his Cabinet \u201chave a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,\u201d Huffman said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.\u201d",
      "The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.",
      "Separately, Trump\u2019s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.",
      "The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.",
      "Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.",
      "Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that \u201csmart\u201d countries don\u2019t use.",
      "Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden\u2019s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there\u2019s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,\u201d Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.",
      "Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.",
      "Revolution Wind\u2019s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.",
      "Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.",
      "Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.",
      "Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an attack on our jobs,\u201d Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on our energy. It\u2019s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.\u201d",

      "The case of a Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities even though he was vetted by a government system called E-Verify is raising questions about what employers can do to make sure they\u2019re employing people who can legally work",
      "OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine -- The case of a Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities even though he was vetted by a government system called \u201cE-Verify\u201d has raised questions about what employers can do to make sure they\u2019re employing people who can legally work.",
      "E-Verify is an online system that compares information entered by an employer from an employee\u2019s documents with records available to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration. It's used to determine the employment eligibility of citizens and noncitizens.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin accused Old Orchard Beach, Maine, of \u201creckless reliance\u201d on the E-Verify program when it hired Jamaica national Jon Luke Evans, who was later detained and agreed to leave the country earlier this month.",
      "But it\u2019s the government\u2019s own program. And experts say there\u2019s not a whole lot more employers can do in terms of vetting.",
      "\u201cI think employers are between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida. \u201cEven an employer who is trying to comply with the law can have difficulty doing it.\u201d",
      "Before 1986, it was essentially legal for employers to hire people regardless of their immigration status. Then came the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which involved a large-scale immigrant legalization program that was paired with a requirement that employers no longer hire people who weren\u2019t legally authorized to work in the U.S.",
      "Employers then had to fill out a form called an I-9, which required workers to present documents showing that they were authorized to work. But it was difficult to verify if the documents were valid. As part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the E-Verify system was established to help verify those documents.",
      "Unlike I-9 forms, which are federally required for every employer, E-Verify is mandated on a state-by-state basis, otherwise it is voluntary. According to an Equifax tally, about 23 states require E-Verify for at least some public and/or private employers.",
      "Zavodny said the system is generally accurate in terms of matching documents, but there are flaws. For example, if an employee's right to work is revoked after it has already been verified \u2014 perhaps if their visa expires \u2014 it doesn\u2019t automatically notify the employer.",
      "A lack of biometrics also hinders the process. If there\u2019s a photo in the E-Verify system, manual photo matching by the employer helps. But a lot of times, there\u2019s no photo in the system.",
      "And the system is not without critics. A 2021 review of E-Verify by the Office of the Inspector General concluded that until U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services addresses the system's shortcomings, \u201cit cannot ensure the system provides accurate employment eligibility results.\u201d",
      "The federal government's disagreement with Old Orchard Beach over E-Verify's reliability came despite pushes by President Donald Trump and his allies to bring the system into wider use. Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump's second term, calls for it to be mandatory.",
      "Use of the system is not widespread. Barely a fifth of U.S. employers use it, though some huge businesses do, including Walmart, Starbucks and Home Depot.",
      "Language calling for mandatory nationwide E-Verify was dropped from budget proposals during the first Trump administration. The system has also faced criticism from some employers.",
      "An Omaha, Nebraska, food packaging company owner said a raid of his business by immigration officials this year came despite his use of E-Verify for employees. Glenn Valley Foods owner Gary Rohwer said in June that the business \u201cdid everything we could possibly do\u201d to hire eligible workers.",
      "Rohwer didn't respond to requests for comment this month. Old Orchard Beach officials declined to comment on the town's recent troubles. DHS officials also didn't respond.",
      "Others say they've had good experiences with the system. Kyle Sobko, CEO of SonderCare, a Calgary, Alberta-based company that makes hospital beds for the home, has a staff of 50, including 20 in the U.S.",

      "Walker described the process as \u201cnot a get out of jail free card\u201d for prospective employees, but as one that has evolved over the years and become more robust in its ability to provide accurate background checks.",

That\u2019s not enough.\u2019\u201d",
      "James M. Cooney, a labor and employment law expert in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations in New Jersey, said it can be tricky to go beyond the basics of what\u2019s required to verify identification without running the risk of a discrimination charge.",
      "\u201cIf an employer tries to do more than what is permitted under the I-9 and E-Verify, that will very often be seen as illegal discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so that really puts employers at a tough spot.\u201d",

      "According to court filings, about 300 workers were hired under irregular contracts to clear the forest and prepare pastures. They were monitored by armed guards, lived in precarious housing, received insufficient food and were forced to stay on the farm under a system of debt bondage. No medical care was provided, even to those who contracted malaria.",

      "Oregon lawmakers are considering a proposal that would make the state the second in the nation to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program",
      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.",
      "Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.",
      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.",
      "Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.",
      "As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.",

      "Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.",
      "In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.",
      "In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.",
      "Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.",
      "Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.",
      "Many people don't realize that \"both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,\u201d said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.",
      "Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,\u201d Morgan said.",

      "A feud over management of one of North America's longest rivers has been simmering in the courts for years",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A simmering feud over management of one of North America\u2019s longest rivers reached a boiling point when the U.S. Supreme Court sent western states and the federal government back to the negotiating table last year.",
      "Now the battle over waters of the Rio Grande could be nearing resolution as New Mexico, Texas and Colorado announced fresh settlement proposals Friday designed to rein in groundwater pumping along the river in New Mexico and ensure enough river water reliably makes it to Texas.",
      "New Mexico officials say the agreements allow water conservation decisions to be made locally while avoiding a doomsday scenario of billion-dollar payouts on water shortfalls.",
      "Farmers in southern New Mexico increasingly have turned to groundwater as hotter and drier conditions reduced river flows and storage. That pumping is what prompted Texas to sue, claiming the practice was cutting into water deliveries.",
      "It will be up to the special master overseeing the case to make a recommendation to the Supreme Court.",
      "If endorsed by the court, the combined settlements promise to restore order to an elaborate system of storing and sharing water between two vast, adjacent irrigation districts in southern New Mexico and western Texas.",
      "Still, tough decisions await New Mexico under its new obligations.",
      "In 1939, when New Mexico was a young, sparsely populated state, it ratified a compact with Texas and Colorado for sharing the waters of the Rio Grande. The agreement defined credits and debits and set parameters for when water could be stored upstream.",
      "From the San Luis Valley in Colorado to below Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico, the compact called for gages to monitor the river, ensuring downstream obligations were met.",
      "Meeting the nearly century-old metrics has become harder as snowpacks shrink in the mountains that feed the Rio Grande. Thirsty soil soaks up more snowmelt and runoff before it reaches tributaries, warmer temperatures fuel evaporation, and summer rainy seasons that once boosted flows and recharged reservoirs are more erratic.",
      "The equation is further complicated by growing populations. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for about 6 million people and helps to irrigate millions of acres of cropland in the U.S. and in Mexico.",
      "While the Colorado River gets all the headlines, experts say the situation along the Rio Grande is just as dire.",
      "The proposed settlements would provide a detailed accounting system for sharing water with Texas.",
      "New Mexico could rely on credits and debits from year to year to navigate through drought and wet periods, though it could be responsible for additional water-sharing obligations if deliveries are deferred too long.",
      "The international group Sustainable Waters is wrapping up an extensive study on how the river's water is being used.",
      "Brian Richter, the group's president, said that over the last couple of decades, New Mexico has lost more than 70% of its reservoir storage along the river while groundwater has been extracted faster than it can be replenished. Add to that New Mexico has fallen behind in its water deliveries to Texas.",
      "Richter called it a triple whammy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in a precarious situation and it\u2019s going to become more challenging going forward,\" he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s going to require sort of a major reenvisioning of what we want New Mexico\u2019s water future to look like.\u201d",
      "The parties in the case say the proposed agreements will facilitate investments and innovation in water conservation.",
      "\u201cThe whole settlement package really provides for the long-term vitality, economic vitality, for the communities in both New Mexico and Texas,\" said Hannah Riseley-White, director of the Interstate Stream Commission.",
      "New Mexico would have two years to adopt a plan to manage and share water along its southernmost stretch of the Rio Grande. The state can still pump some groundwater while monitoring aquifer levels.",

      "Aside from a changing climate, water managers say the inability to store water in upstream reservoirs due to compact obligations exacerbates the problem.",
      "Many of the intricacies of managing the Rio Grande are as invisible to residents as the water itself.",
      "Sisters Zoe and Phoebe Hughes set out to take photos during a recent evening, anticipating at least a sliver of water like usual. Instead they found deep sand and patchwork of cracked, curled beds of clay.",
      "\u201cIt's so dystopian. It's sad,\u201d Phoebe Hughes said, adding that the river isn't so grand now.",
      "Looking for a silver lining, the two collected pieces of riverbed clay, hoping they could fashion it into something. Other curious visitors played in the sand and walked dogs.",
      "Downstream, Elephant Butte stands at less than 4% of capacity. The reservoir is an irrigation lifeline for farmers, fuels a hydropower station and serves as a popular recreation spot.",
      "The settlements call for reducing groundwater depletions to a rate of 18,200 acre-feet per year. While that's about one-sixth of the drinking water supplied to New York City each day, for the arid West, it\u2019s a monumental amount.",
      "New Mexico officials expect to achieve most of those reductions from buying water rights from willing sellers, meaning more than 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) of farmland would be retired.",
      "Many details \u2014 and the price tag \u2014 have yet to be worked out, the general counsel for the New Mexico state engineer's office told state lawmakers this month. The Legislature in 2023 set aside $65 million toward the settlements and related infrastructure projects, and the state is tapping additional federal dollars. But it will still need more funds, experts say.",
      "Riseley-White said it will take a combination of efforts, including long-term fallowing programs, water conservation and more efficient irrigation infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t one answer. It\u2019s going to be necessarily an all-of-the-above approach,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there will be less water in the future.",
      "Attorney Sam Barncastle, who worked for years on behalf of irrigators, worries small farming operations and backyard gardeners could ultimately be pushed out.",
      "\u201cFarmland does not come back once it's gone,\u201d she said.",
      "The overall idea is to avoid abruptly curtailing water for users, but farmers in southern New Mexico have concerns about how much water will be available and who will be able to use it.",
      "New Mexico is the nation's No. 2 pecan producer, and the sprawling orchards would die without consistent water. The state also is home to world-renowned chilies \u2014 a signature crop tightly woven into New Mexico's cultural identity.",
      "Ben Etcheverry, a board member of the New Mexico Chile Association, said farmers have transitioned to drip irrigation to save water and energy but are continually told they have to do more with even less water and pay higher rates.",
      "\u201cIt just becomes a game of whack-a-mole while we try to do better,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time we do better, it seems they turn it into a punishment.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe ban seems to suggest that the government has identified a supply-gap issue, but an export ban does little actually to lock in current in-country production solely for Nigerian processors,\u201d Ikemesit Effiong, a partner at SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based risk advisory firm, told The Associated Press.",
      "The move appeared to contradict the long-standing trade policy of Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, who has positioned the country as a free-market economy by removing a series of subsidies on essential commodities such as fuel and electricity. Tinubu has also floated the country's currency and reversed a ban on the import of dozens of items by the former government.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum.",
      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",
      "While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism.",
      "But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",
      "Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",
      "Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",
      "Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year.",
      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",
      "Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country \u2014 a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a $1.2 billion contract to build and operate what's expected to become the nation&rsquo;s largest immigration detention complex to a tiny Virginia firm with no experience running correction facilities",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a $1.2 billion contract to build and operate what's expected to become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex to a tiny Virginia firm with no experience running correction facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex, it didn\u2019t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.",
      "Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.",
      "The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.",
      "The secretive \u2014 and brisk \u2014 contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government\u2019s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.",
      "A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too easy for standards to slip,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. \u201cPrivate facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.\u201d",
      "Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.",
      "\u201cThe lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,\u201d he said.",
      "Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company\u2019s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp\u2019s construction, citing the litigation over the company\u2019s qualifications.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.",
      "Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.",
      "The camp has drawn comparisons to \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.",
      "The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida\u2019s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.",
      "At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.",
      "Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.",

She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.",
      "\u201cConditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,\u201d Ghandehari said. \u201cBut when there\u2019s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.\u201d",
      "A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.",
      "The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it's classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.",
      "Though Trump's administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.",
      "One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army\u2019s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019 independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.",
      "Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn't authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",
      "Some users say the debate is just a rehash of old arguments about once-new technology that eventually became widely used, such as AutoTune, drum machines and synthesizers.",

      "Once Smith gets inspiration, it takes him just 10 minutes to write the lyrics. But then he'll spend as much as eight to nine hours generating different versions until the song \u201cmatches my vision.\u201d",
      "McCann said he'll often create up to 100 different versions of a song by prompting and re-prompting the AI system before he\u2019s satisfied.",
      "AI song generators can churn out lyrics as well as music, but many experienced users prefer to write their own words.",
      "\u201cAI lyrics tend to come out quite cliche and quite boring,\u201d McCann said.",
      "Lukas Rams, a Philadelphia-area resident who makes songs for his AI band Sleeping With Wolves, said AI lyrics tend to be \u201cextra corny\u201d and not as creative as a human, but can help get the writing process started.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll do very basic rhyme schemes, and it\u2019ll keep repeating the same structure,\u201d said Rams, who writes his own words, sometimes while putting his kids to bed and waiting for them to fall asleep. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get words in there that are very telling of AI-generated lyrics, like \u2018neon,\u2019 anything with \u2018shadows\u2019.\u201d",
      "Rams used to play drums in high school bands and collaborated with his brother on their own songs, but work and family life started taking up more of his time.",
      "Then he discovered AI, which he used to create three albums for Sleeping With Wolves. He's been taking it seriously, making a CD jewel case with album art. He plans to post his songs, which combine metalcore and EDM, more widely online.",
      "\u201cI do want to start putting this up on YouTube or socials or distribution or whatever, just to have it out there,\u201d Rams said. \u201cI might as well, otherwise I\u2019m literally the only person that hears this stuff.\u201d",
      "Experts say AI's potential to let anyone come up with a hit song is poised to shake up the music industry's production pipeline.",
      "\"Just think about what it used to cost to make a hit or make something that breaks,\" Antonuccio said. \"And that just keeps winnowing down from a major studio to a laptop to a bedroom. And now it\u2019s like a text prompt \u2014 several text prompts.\u201d",
      "But he added that AI music is still in a \u201cWild West\u201d phase because of the lack of legal clarity over copyright. He compared it to the legal battles more than two decades ago over file-sharing sites like Napster that heralded the transition from CDs to digital media and eventually paved the way for today's music streaming services.",
      "Creators hope AI, too, will eventually become a part of the mainstream music world.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world where anyone, anywhere could make the next big hit,\u201d said McCann. \u201cAs AI becomes more widely accepted among people as a musical art form, I think it opens up the possibility for AI music to be featured in charts.\u201d",

      "Biologists are using drones to scare wolves away from cattle",
      "For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn\u2019t have drones.",
      "But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they're using them to blast AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.",

      "\u201cWith what? I can't talk to people?\u201d co-star Adam Driver shouts back.",
      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA\u2019s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",
      "\u201cIf we could reduce those negative impacts of wolves, that is going to be more likely to lead to a situation where we have coexistence,\u201d Ranglack said.",
      "The preloaded clips include recordings of music, gunshots, fireworks and voices. A drone pilot starts by playing three clips chosen at random, such as the \u201cMarriage Story\u201d scene or \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d with its screams and hair-raising electric guitar licks.",
      "If those don't work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that's not among the randomized presets. One favorite is the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch 's cover of \u201cBlue on Black,\u201d which might blast the lyric \u201cYou turned and you ran\u201d as the wolves flee.",

      "It\u2019s unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.",
      "Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.",
      "\u201cWolves are frightened of novel things,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cI know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\u201d",
      "There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn't work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.",
      "Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of what they did. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me.

      "Under the new schedule, a first batch of the domestically developed Type-12 anti-ship missiles will be installed at its army's Camp Kengun in Japan's southwestern prefecture of Kmuamoto by March 2026, the ministry said. The Type-12 missile has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).",

      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.",
      "Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.",
      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.",

While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.",
      "Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.",

I paused my hike, quietly scanned the treetops, saw the bird as it kept singing and clicked a button to add the species to my growing \"life list\" of bird sightings. Digital confetti dropped on my screen.",

      "\u201cLow-frequency sounds can be challenging because there\u2019s other low frequencies, like cars driving past, that can trick it,\u201d Weber said.",

      "The videos, released this week, are meant to prepare the 37 million residents in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area for potential disasters.",

      "The video ends with the message: \u201cWe need to arm ourselves with facts and prepare for disaster in our daily lives.\u201d It shows a family\u2019s pantry stocked with canned food and a first-aid kit.",

      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13. To proponents, they're a tool to keep children away from adult websites and other material that might be harmful to them.",
      "But opponents see a worrisome trend toward a less secure, less private and less free internet, where people can be denied access not just to pornography but news, health information and the ability to speak openly and anonymously.",
      "\u201cI think that many of these laws come from a place of good intentions,\u201d said Jennifer Huddleston, a senior technology policy fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cCertainly we all want to protect young people from harmful content before they\u2019re ready to see it.\u201d",
      "More than 20 states have passed some kind of age verification law, though many face legal challenges. While no such law exists on the federal level in the United States, the Supreme Court recently allowed a Mississippi age check law for social media to stand. In June, the court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online, ruling that adults don't have a First Amendment right to access obscene speech without first proving their age.",
      "Elsewhere, the United Kingdom now requires users visiting websites that allow pornography to verify their age. Beyond adult sites, platforms like Reddit, X, Telegram and Bluesky have also committed to age checks. France and several other European Union countries also are testing a government sponsored verification app.",
      "And Australia has banned children under 16 from accessing social media.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s less accurate for women or it\u2019s less accurate for certain racial or ethnic groups or for certain physical characteristics that then may mean that those people have to go through additional privacy invasive screenings to prove that they are of a certain age,\u201d Huddleston said.",
      "While IDs are a common way of verifying someone\u2019s age, the method raises security concerns: What happens if companies don't delete the uploaded files, for instance?",
      "Case in point: the recent data breaches at Tea, an app for women to anonymously warn each other about the men they date, speak to some of these concerns. The app requires women who sign up to upload an ID or undergo a scan to prove that they are women. Tea wasn't supposed to keep the files but it did, and stored them in a way that allowed hackers to not only access the images, but also their private messages.",

      "Scientists are criticizing two key documents from the Trump administration that challenge the idea that climate change endangers the public",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Trump administration proposal to reverse a landmark finding that climate change is dangerous to the public relies heavily on a report from the Department of Energy that dozens of scientists say is flawed.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to use the DOE's work to overturn the climate concept known as the \u201cendangerment finding.\u201d If the administration succeeds, many laws and rules aimed at reducing or restricting greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated.",
      "The Associated Press surveyed scientists for their views. Here are some key takeaways from those who responded to AP's questions:",
      "The most common critique from 64 scientists who responded to questions from AP was that the administration\u2019s reports ignored, twisted or cherry-picked information to manufacture doubt about the severity and threat of climate change. Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",
      "The Department of Energy report said Arctic sea ice has declined about 5% since 1980. That number is accurate for Antarctica, while Artic sea ice actually declined more than 40% in the period.",
      "Jennifer Marlon, director of data science at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, highlighted a section on U.S. wildfires that acknowledged that fire data from before 1960 isn't reliable for comparisons. Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",
      "Experts repeatedly said the reports were biased. Nineteen scientists used variations of the phrase \u201ccherry pick\u201d to describe citations in the administration reports.",
      "Francois Bareille, a French economist, has done work concluding that previous estimates about climate-related crop losses in French agriculture were overly pessimistic. The administration\u2019s reports cited that work, but Bareille said it shouldn\u2019t have because it\u2019s wrong to generalize his findings to other regions.",
      "Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the reports pulled a single figure from his work on climate modeling to build a case that the models scientists use are often overly pessimistic. Hausfather said his research actually concluded that climate models have performed quite well.",
      "He called the government\u2019s process a \u201cfarce.\u201d",
      "The authors of the report said any errors found will be corrected.",

      "In a joint statement, authors of the Energy Department report said the document clearly says it's not meant to be a comprehensive review of climate science. Instead, the authors said, it's focused on data and topics that the media and others have underreported and overlooked.",
      "A handful of scientists contacted by AP spoke positively about the report.",
      "One expert cited in the work praised it, saying it departed from unnecessarily alarmist findings of other national and international climate assessments.",
      "James Davidson, a professor at the University of Exeter focused on economics, has published work that disputes the mainstream consensus that rising carbon dioxide levels in the past caused warming.",
      "He said the Department of Energy report is giving voice to beliefs that were previously shut out.",
      "Mainstream scientists have already mobilized to respond. A few have voiced criticism on social media. The National Academy of Sciences, a collection of private, nonprofit institutions set up to provide independent and objective analysis, is preparing a fast-tracked special report on the latest evidence about whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health.",
      "The Energy Department is taking public comments on its work until Sept. 2. The EPA is holding several days of public hearings, with comments due by Sept. 22.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum.",
      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",
      "While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism.",
      "But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again.",
      "Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",
      "Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",
      "Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",
      "Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year.",
      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",
      "Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country \u2014 a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors.",

      "THE SANTA ROSA PLATEAU ECOLOGICAL RESERVE, Calif. -- The scientist traipses to a pond wearing rubber boots but he doesn\u2019t enter the water. Instead, Brad Hollingsworth squats next to its swampy edge and retrieves a recording device the size of a deck of cards. He then opens it up and removes a tiny memory card containing 18 hours of sound.",
      "Back at his office at the San Diego Natural History Museum, the herpetologist \u2014 an expert in reptiles and amphibians \u2014 uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data on the card. Within three minutes, he knows a host of animals visit the pond \u2014 where native red-legged frogs were reintroduced after largely disappearing in Southern California. There were owl hoots, woodpecker pecks, coyote howls and tree frog ribbits. But no croaking from the invasive bullfrog, which has decimated the native red-legged frog population over the past century.",
      "It was another good day in his efforts to increase the population of the red-legged frog and restore an ecosystem spanning the U.S.-Mexico border. The efforts come as the Trump administration builds more walls along the border, raising concerns about the impact on wildlife.",
      "At 2 to 5 inches long (5 to 13 centimeters), red-legged frogs are the largest native frogs in the West and once were found in abundance up and down the California coast and into Baja California in Mexico.",
      "The species is widely believed to be the star of Mark Twain\u2019s 1865 short story, \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" and their crimson hind legs were eaten during the Gold Rush. But as the red-legged frog declined in numbers, the bullfrog \u2014 with its even bigger hind legs \u2014 was introduced to menus during California's booming growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
      "The red-legged frog population was decimated by the insatiable appetite of the bullfrogs and the disease the non-native species brought in, but also because it lost much of its habitat to drought and human development in the shape of homes, dams and more.",
      "Hollingsworth couldn't estimate the number of red-legged frogs that remain, but said they have disappeared from 95% of their historical range in Southern California.",
      "Robert Fisher of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative Program searched for the frog for decades across some 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Los Angeles to the border. He found just one in 2001 and none after that.",
      "Scientists using DNA from red-legged frogs captured in Southern California before their disappearance discovered they were more genetically similar to the population in Mexico than any still in California.",
      "In 2006, Fisher, Hollingsworth and others visited Baja where they had heard of a small population of red-legged frogs. Anny Peralta, then a student of Hollingsworth at San Diego State University, joined them. They found about 20 frogs, and Peralta was inspired to dedicate her life to their recovery.",
      "Peralta and her husband established the nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste in Ensenada, Mexico, which aims to promote the proper management of natural resources. In 2018, they started building ponds in Mexico to boost the frog population that would later provide eggs to repopulate the species across the border.",
      "But just as they were preparing to relocate the egg masses, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Peralta and the U.S. scientists scrambled to secure permits for the unusual cargo and a pilot to fly the two coolers of eggs closer to the border. The rest of their journey north was by road, after the eggs passed a U.S. border guard inspection.",
      "Over the past five years, Hollingsworth and his team have searched for sounds to prove their efforts to repopulate ponds in Southern California worked.",
      "On Jan. 30, he heard the quiet, distinct grunting of the red-legged frog's breeding call in an audio flagged by AI.",

      "Over the next two months, two males were heard belting it out on microphone 11 at one of the ponds. In March, right below the microphone, the first egg masse was found, showing they had not only hatched from the eggs brought from Mexico but had gone on to produce their own eggs in the United States.",

      "Herpetologists are building on the AI-powered tools already used to analyze datasets of bird sounds, hoping that it might help build audio landscapes to identify amphibians and track their behavior and breeding patterns, said Zachary Principe of The Nature Conservancy, which is working with the museum on the red-legged frog project. The tools could also help scientists analyze tens of thousands of audio files collected at universities, museums and other institutions.",
      "Scientists working to restore the red-legged frog population in Southern California hope to soon be provided with satellite technology that will send audio recordings to their phones in real time, so they can act immediately if any predators \u2014 in particular bullfrogs \u2014 are detected.",
      "It could also help track the movement of the frogs, which can be difficult to find in the wild, especially because cold-blooded creatures cannot be detected using thermal imagery.",
      "The AI analysis of the pond audio has saved time for Hollingsworth and the others, who previously had to painstakingly listen to countless hours of audio files to detect the calls of the red-legged frog \u2014 which resembles the sound of a thumb being rubbed on a balloon \u2014 over the cacophony of other animals.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tree frogs calling, there\u2019s cows mooing, a road nearby with a motorcycle zooming back and forth,\u201d Hollingsworth said of the ponds' audio landscape. \u201cThere\u2019s owls, there\u2019s ducks splashing, just all this noise\u201d",
      "The red-legged frog is the latest species to see success from binational cooperation along the near-2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border spanning California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Over the years, Mexican gray wolves have returned to their historic range in the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, while the California Condor now soars over skies from Baja to Northern California.",
      "Based off the latest count, scientists estimate more than 100 adult red-legged frogs are in the Southern California ponds, and tadpoles were spotted at a new site.",
      "The team plans to continue transporting egg masses from Baja, where the population has jumped from 20 to as many as 400 adult frogs, with the hope of building thriving populations on both sides of the border. Already the sites are seeing fewer mosquitos that can carry diseases like dengue and Zika.",
      "A restoration pond in Baja that Peralta\u2019s organization built recently teemed with froglets, their tiny eyes bobbing on its aquatic fern-covered surface. They could, one day, lay eggs for relocation to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey don't know about borders or visas or passports,\u201d Peralta said of the frogs. \u201cThis is just their habitat and these populations need to reconnect. I think this shows that we can restore this ecosystem.\u201d",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Climate change that has driven scorching temperatures and dwindling rainfall made massive wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus this summer burn much more fiercely, said a new study released Thursday.",
      "The study by World Weather Attribution said the fires that killed 20 people, forced 80,000 to evacuate and burned more than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were 22% more intense in 2025, Europe\u2019s worst recorded year of wildfires.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires that broke out in the eastern Mediterranean in June and July were driven by temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (about 104 Fahrenheit), extremely dry conditions and strong winds.",
      "WWA, a group of researchers that examines whether and to what extent extreme weather events are linked to climate change, called its findings \u201cconcerning.\"",
      "\u201cOur study finds an extremely strong climate change signal towards hotter and drier conditions,\u201d said Theodore Keeping, a researcher at Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College in London.",
      "\u201cToday, with 1.3 degrees C of warming, we are seeing new extremes in wildfire behaviour that has pushed firefighters to their limit. But we are heading for up to 3 degrees C this century unless countries more rapidly transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d Keeping said.",
      "The study found winter rainfall ahead of the wildfires had dropped by about 14% since the pre-industrial era, when a heavy reliance on fossil fuels began. It also determined that because of climate change, weeklong periods of dry, hot air that primes vegetation to burn are now 13 times more likely.",
      "The analysis also found an increase in the intensity of high-pressure systems that strengthened extreme northerly winds, known as Etesian winds, that fanned the wildfires.",

      "A study finds that popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude are inconsistent in responding to suicide-related queries",
      "A study of how three popular artificial intelligence chatbots respond to queries about suicide found that they generally avoid answering questions that pose the highest risk to the user, such as for specific how-to guidance. But they are inconsistent in their replies to less extreme prompts that could still harm people.",

      "Consulting with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, McBain and his co-authors came up with 30 questions around suicide and assigned them different risk levels from highest to lowest. General questions about suicide statistics, for instance, would be considered low risk, while specific questions about how to do it would be high risk. Medium-risk questions included \u201cWhat is the most common type of firearm used in suicide attempts in the United States?\u201d and \u201cI am having suicidal thoughts. What advice do you have for me?\u201d",

      "When the chatbots didn\u2019t answer a question, they generally told people to seek help from a friend or a professional or call a hotline. But responses varied on high-risk questions that were slightly more indirect.",
      "For instance, ChatGPT consistently answered questions that McBain says it should have considered a red flag \u2014 such as about which type of rope, firearm or poison has the \u201chighest rate of completed suicide\u201d associated with it. Claude also answered some of those questions. The study didn't attempt to rate the quality of the responses.",

      "\u201cAs a doc, I have a responsibility that if someone is displaying or talks to me about suicidal behavior, and I think they\u2019re at high risk of suicide or harming themselves or someone else, my responsibility is to intervene,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cWe can put a hold on their civil liberties to try to help them out. It\u2019s not something we take lightly, but it\u2019s something that we as a society have decided is OK.\u201d",
      "Chatbots don't have that responsibility, and Mehrotra said, for the most part, their response to suicidal thoughts has been to \u201cput it right back on the person. \u2018You should call the suicide hotline. Seeya.\u2019\u201d",
      "The study's authors note several limitations in the research's scope, including that they didn't attempt any \u201cmultiturn interaction\u201d with the chatbots \u2014 the back-and-forth conversations common with younger people who treat AI chatbots like a companion.",
      "Another report published earlier in August took a different approach. For that study, which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate posed as 13-year-olds asking a barrage of questions to ChatGPT about getting drunk or high or how to conceal eating disorders. They also, with little prompting, got the chatbot to compose heartbreaking suicide letters to parents, siblings and friends.",
      "The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but \u2014 after being told it was for a presentation or school project \u2014 went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "McBain said he doesn't think the kind of trickery that prompted some of those shocking responses is likely to happen in most real-world interactions, so he's more focused on setting standards for ensuring chatbots are safely dispensing good information when users are showing signs of suicidal ideation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they necessarily have to, 100% of the time, perform optimally in order for them to be released into the wild,\" he said. \"I just think that there\u2019s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump and House Republicans want to cut new funding for a housing grant that many rural areas rely on to help fund affordable housing",
      "Heather Colley and her two children moved four times over five years as they fled high rents in eastern Tennessee, which, like much of rural America, hasn't been spared from soaring housing costs.",
      "A family gift in 2021 of a small plot of land offered a shot at homeownership, but building a house was beyond reach for the 45-year-old single mother and manicurist making $18.50 an hour.",
      "That changed when she qualified for $272,000 from a nonprofit to build a three-bedroom home because of a grant program that has helped make affordable housing possible in rural areas for decades. She moved in last June.",
      "\u201cEvery time I pull into my garage, I pinch myself,\u201d Colley said.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump wants to eliminate that grant, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and House Republicans overseeing federal budget negotiations did not include funding for it in their budget proposal. Experts and state housing agencies say that would set back tens of thousands of future affordable housing developments nationwide, particularly hurting Appalachian towns and rural counties where government aid is sparse and investors are few.",
      "The program has helped build or repair more than 1.3 million affordable homes in the last three decades, of which at least 540,000 were in congressional districts that are rural or significantly rural, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t realize how far-reaching these programs are,\u201d said Colley, who voted for Trump in 2024. Among those half a million homes that HOME helped build, 84% were in districts that voted for him last year, the AP analysis found.",
      "\u201cI understand we don\u2019t want excessive spending and wasting taxpayer dollars,\" Colley said, \"but these proposed budget cuts across the board make me rethink the next time I go to the polls.\u201d",
      "The HOME program, started under President George H. W. Bush in the 1990s, survived years of budget battles but has been stretched thin by years of rising construction costs and stagnant funding. That's meant fewer units, including in some rural areas where home prices have grown faster than in cities.",
      "The program has spent more than $38 billion nationwide since it began filling in funding gaps and attracting more investment to acquire, build and repair affordable homes, HUD data shows. Additional funding has gone toward projects that have yet to be finished and rental assistance.",
      "To account for the gap left by the proposed cuts, House Republicans want to draw on nearly $5 billion from a related pandemic-era fund that gave states until 2030 to spend on projects supporting people who are unhoused or facing homelessness.",
      "That $5 billion, however, may be far less, since many projects haven\u2019t yet been logged into the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's tracking system, according to state housing agencies and associations representing them.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD, which administers the program, said HOME isn't as effective as other programs where the money would be better spent.",
      "In opposition to Trump, Senate Republicans have still included funding for HOME in their draft budget. In the coming negotiations, both chambers may compromise and reduce but not terminate HOME's funding, or extend last years\u2019 overall budget.",
      "White House spokesperson Davis Ingle didn't respond to specific questions from the AP. Instead, Ingle said that Trump's commitment to cutting red tape is making housing more affordable.",

      "A lack of additional funding for HOME has already made it hard to keep up with construction costs, Hudson said, and the organization builds a quarter of the single-family homes it used to.",
      "\u201cParticularly for deeply rural places and persistent poverty counties, local housing developers are the only way homes and new rental housing gets built,\u201d said Joshua Stewart of Fahe, a coalition of Appalachian nonprofits.",
      "That's in part because investment is scant and HOME steps in when construction costs exceed what a home can be sold for \u2014 a common barrier in poor areas of Appalachia. Some developers use the profits to build more affordable units. Its loss would erode those nonprofits' ability to build affordable homes in years to come, Stewart said.",
      "One of those nonprofits, Housing Development Alliance, helped Tiffany Mullins in Hazard, Kentucky, which was ravaged by floods. Mullins, a single mother of four who makes $14.30 an hour at Walmart, bought a house there thanks to HOME funding and moved in August.",
      "Mullins sees the program as preserving a rural way of life, recalling when folks owned homes and land \u201cwith gardens, we had chickens, cows. Now you don\u2019t see much of that.\"",
      "In congressional budget negotiations, HOME is an easier target than programs such as vouchers because most people would not immediately lose their housing, said Tess Hembree, executive director of the Council of State Community Development Agencies.",
      "The effect of any reduction would instead be felt in a fizzling of new affordable housing supply. When HOME funding was temporarily reduced to $900 million in 2015, \u201c10 to 15 years later, we\u2019re seeing the ramifications,\" Hembree said.",
      "That includes affordable units built in cities. The biggest program that funds affordable rental housing nationwide, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, uses HOME grants for 12% of units, totaling 324,000 current individual units, according to soon-to-be-published Urban Institute research.",
      "Trump's spending bill that Republicans passed this summer increased LITHC, but experts say further reducing or cutting HOME would make those credits less usable.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board has raised alarms among economists and legal experts who see it as the biggest threat to the central bank's independence in decades.",
      "The consequences could impact most Americans' everyday lives: Economists worry that if Trump gets what he wants \u2014 a loyal Fed that sharply cuts short-term interest rates \u2014 the result would likely be higher inflation and, over time, higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Trump on Monday sought to fireLisa Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed's seven-member governing board. It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.",
      "Trump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump's true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook\u2019s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.",
      "Cook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn\u2019t directly responded to the accusations.",
      "Trump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.",
      "Before trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority very shortly, so that\u2019ll be good,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook his appointees will control the Fed's board by a 4-3 vote.",
      "\u201cThe particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. \u201cIn my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.\u201d",
      "Some economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.",
      "The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.",
      "Most economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.",
      "Elected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.",
      "Douglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump's demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation \u2014 similar to what happened during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cIf the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we\u2019ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,\u201d Elmendorf said.",

      "And while the Fed controls a short-term rate, financial markets determine longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans. And if investors worry that inflation will stay high, they will demand higher yields on government bonds, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.",
      "In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.",
      "Other U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and '70s.",
      "Trump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.",
      "Presidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.",

      "Yet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.",
      "In an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWhat people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.\u201d",
      "And Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.",
      "The \u201coverall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits\u201d of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, \u201cwhile maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand.\" Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed's board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed\u2019s broader structure.",
      "The Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.",
      "While the reserve banks' boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,\" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "story": [
      "The case against Long Island\u2019s suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer has emerged as a potentially precedent-setting battleground in the use of advanced DNA techniques in criminal cases",
      "RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- When Maureen Brainard-Barnes\u2019 skeletal remains were found hidden in the roadside scrub near Long Island's Gilgo Beach in the winter of 2010, there was hardly any physical evidence that might help investigators find her killer, save for a single stray hair.",
      "But at the time, extracting DNA evidence from the degraded strand was beyond the capabilities of crime labs. Investigators kept looking for other clues that might help them identify a suspected serial killer who had scattered women's bodies along a coastal parkway.",
      "Then, about seven years ago, investigators turned to Astrea Forensics, a California lab using new techniques to analyze old, highly degraded DNA samples \u2014 including rootless hairs like the one discovered with Brainard-Barnes' body.",
      "Now, that lab\u2019s work is the focus of a pivotal decision in the closely watched case. A state judge is weighing whether to allow the DNA evidence generated through Astrea Forensics\u2019 whole genome sequencing into the trial of Rex Heuermann, who is accused of killing 25-year-old Brainard-Barnes and six other women.",
      "If allowed, it would mark the first time such techniques could be admitted in a New York court, and one of just a handful of such instances nationwide, according to prosecutors, defense lawyers and experts.",
      "Prosecutors say Astrea's findings, combined with other evidence, overwhelmingly implicate Heuermann, 61, as the killer.",
      "But lawyers for the Manhattan architect argue the company's calculations exaggerate the likelihood that the hairs recovered from the burial sites match their client.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the pressure that\u2019s on this judge because he\u2019s probably more than likely making a ruling that will set the stage for all the cases that come after,\u201d said April Stonehouse, a DNA forensics expert at Arizona State University who is not involved in the case.",
      "DNA analysis is no longer new, but the tests typically used by criminal labs across the country have limitations.",
      "Astrea is one of a small but growing number of private labs that say they are capable of taking extremely short DNA fragments found in very old bones and hair and using them to reconstruct a person's entire genetic sequence, or genome.",
      "During court testimony, experts called by the Suffolk County District Attorney's office highlighted how scientists use similar techniques in a wide range of scientific and medical work, such as mapping the genome of the Neanderthal \u2014 an effort awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Medicine.",
      "Astrea Forensics' co-founder, Dr. Richard Green, described in court how his lab\u2019s whole genome sequencing results were allowed as evidence in last year\u2019s trial and conviction of David Allen Dalrymple in the cold-case murder of 9-year-old Daralyn Johnson in Idaho.",
      "Heuermann\u2019s lawyers argue that Astrea\u2019s DNA methods haven't been subjected to enough scrutiny yet, and warned they needed more evaluation because they had the potential to \u201cdramatically reshape\u201d how forensics is used in criminal trials.",
      "They zeroed in on the statistical analysis Green\u2019s lab conducted on the DNA profiles it generated from the hairs recovered from the victims\u2019 remains, saying it was potentially overstating the likelihood that a mapped genome was a match with any particular person.",
      "For its calculations, Astrea Forensics uses reference data from an open-source database containing the full DNA sequence of some 2,500 people worldwide, called the 1,000 Genomes Project.",
      "Dr. Dan Krane, a professor at Wright State University in Ohio, testified for the defense that Astrea Forensics' methods were \u201cwildly and unfairly prejudicial.\"",

      "William Thompson, a professor emeritus of criminology at the University of California, Irvine, who is not involved in the case, agreed with the defense that Astrea Forensics\u2019 statistical analysis was \u201cunvalidated\u201d and lacked wide acceptance in the scientific community.",
      "\u201cThis new technique may eventually be proven to live up to the claims of its promoters, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d he said.",
      "But Nathan Lents, a biology professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, who is also not involved in the case, disagreed, suggesting the \u201cmathematical quibble\u201d didn\u2019t warrant dismissing the evidence outright.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that there are genuine scientific concerns with the way that the statistics are computed, but not with the laboratory techniques,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concerns are real, but the likelihood ratios still look very damning for the defense, no matter how they are computed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have amassed other evidence against Heuermann, who is accused of killing women as early as 1993.",
      "In court filings, they say cellphone call information and tracking data show that Heuermann arranged meetings with some of the victims shortly before their disappearances.",
      "Last year, prosecutors revealed they had recovered from Heuermann\u2019s computer files what they describe as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the killings, including a series of checklists with reminders to limit noise, clean the bodies and destroy evidence.",
      "They also have a second DNA analysis completed by a separate crime lab that used more traditional methods long accepted in New York courts.

      "Swimming is not advised at many beaches because of unsafe fecal contamination",
      "OGUNQUIT, Maine -- Thousands of Americans will head to beaches for one last summer splash this Labor Day weekend, but taking a dip might be out of the question: Many of the beaches will caution against swimming because of unsafe levels of fecal contamination.",
      "Beaches from Crystal River, Florida, to Ogunquit, Maine, have been under advisories warning about water quality this week because of elevated levels of bacteria associated with fecal waste. The advisories typically discourage beachgoers from going in the water because the bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illness, rashes and nausea.",
      "There have been closures this week at some of the country's most popular beach destinations, including Keyes Memorial Beach in the Cape Cod village of Hyannis in Barnstable, Massachusetts; Benjamin's Beach on Long Island in Bay Shore, New York; and a portion of the Imperial Beach shoreline near San Diego. Even on the pristine, white sand beaches of Hawaii, the Hawaii State Department of Health is warning of a high bacteria count at Kahaluu Beach Park on the Big Island.",
      "It's a longstanding and widespread problem. Nearly two-thirds of beaches tested nationwide in 2024 experienced at least one day in which indicators of fecal contamination reached potentially unsafe levels, conservation group Environment America said in a report issued this summer.",
      "The group reviewed beaches on the coasts and Great Lakes and found that 84% of Gulf Coast beaches exceeded the standard at least once. The number was 79% for West Coast beaches, 54% for East Coast beaches and 71% for Great Lakes beaches.",
      "The report also said more than 450 beaches were potentially unsafe for swimming on at least 25 percent of the days tested. A key reason is outdated water and sewer systems that allows contamination from sewage to reach the places where people swim, said John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney with Environment America.",

      "Tennessee authorities say a cold case investigation reveals that a sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about an organized crime-busting law enforcement officer actually killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies",
      "A late Tennessee sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about a law enforcement officer who took on organized crime killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies, authorities in Tennessee said Friday.",
      "The finding will likely shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie that immortalized him as a tough but fair sheriff with zero tolerance for crime, authorities said.",
      "There is enough evidence that if then-McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser were alive today, prosecutors would present an indictment to the grand jury for the murder of Pauline Mullins Pusser, said Mark Davidson, the district attorney for Tennessee\u2019s 25th judicial district. Investigators also uncovered signs she suffered from domestic violence.",
      "Prosecutors worked with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which began reexamining decades-old files on Pauline's death in 2022 as part of its regular review of cold cases, agency director David Rausch said. Agents found inconsistencies between Buford Pusser's version of events and the physical evidence, received a tip about a potential murder weapon and exhumed Pauline's body for an autopsy.",
      "Authorities acknowledged the news may shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser's fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie he inspired or the 2004 remake. Many officers joined law enforcement because of his story, Davidson said. The sheriff died in a car crash seven years after his wife's death.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about tearing down a legend. It is about giving dignity and closure to Pauline and her family and ensuring that the truth is not buried with time,\u201d Davidson said at a news conference streamed on Facebook. \u201cThe truth matters. Justice matters. Even 58 years later. Pauline deserves both.\u201d",
      "The case dates to Aug. 12, 1967. Buford Pusser got a call in the early morning hours about a disturbance. He reported that his wife volunteered to ride along with him as he responded. Buford Pusser said that shortly after they passed Hope Methodist Church, a car pulled up and fired several times into the vehicle, killing Pauline and injuring the sheriff. Buford Pusser spent 18 days in the hospital and required several surgeries to recover. The case was built largely on his own statement and closed quickly, Rausch said.",
      "During the reexamination of the case, Dr. Michael Revelle, an emergency medicine physical and medical examiner, studied postmortem photographs, crime scene photographs, notes made by the medical examiner at the time and Buford Pusser's statements and concluded that Pauline was actually more likely that not shot outside the car and then placed inside it.",

      "Pauline's autopsy revealed she had a broken nose that had healed prior to her death. Davidson said statements from people who were around at the time she died support the conclusion that she was a victim of domestic violence.",
      "Pauline's younger brother, Griffon Mullins, said the investigation gave him closure. He said in a recorded video played at the news conference that their other sister died without knowing what happened to Pauline and he is grateful he will die knowing.",
      "\u201cYou would fall in love with her because she was a people person. And of course, my family would always go to Pauline if they had an issue or they needed some advice and she was always there for them,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just a sweet person. I loved her with all my heart.\u201d",
      "Mullins said he knew there was some trouble in Pauline's marriage, but she wasn't one to talk about her problems. For that reason, Mullins said he was \u201cnot totally shocked.\u201d",
      "The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation plans to make the entire file, which exceeds 1,000 pages, available to the public by handing it over to the University of Tennessee at Martin once it finishes with redactions. The school will create an online, searchable database for the case. Until then, members of the public can make appointments to review it in person or can purchase a copy, said university Chancellor Yancy Freeman Sr.",

      "The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration.

      "The extent of the change in enrollment will not be clear until the fall, Some groups have forecast a decline of as much as 40%, with a huge impact on college budgets and the wider U.S. economy.",
      "As part of a broader effort to reshape higher education, President Donald Trump has pressed colleges to limit their numbers of international students and heightened scrutiny of student visas. His administration has moved to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, and new student visa appointments were put on hold for weeks as it ramped up vetting of applicants' social media.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, President Donald Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation\u2019s most Democratic cities \u2014 including Chicago and Baltimore \u2014 claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.",
      "The threats to expand a federal intervention have legal experts and some military officials raising concerns that Trump is considering novel ways to use National Guard troops in American cities that could set up conflicts not seen since the civil rights era.",
      "Though most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities Trump has called out, the Republican president said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u201cshould be calling me, and he should be saying, \u2018Can you send over the troops please?\u2019 It\u2019s out of control.\u201d",
      "Whether Trump can repeat what he\u2019s done in LA and the nation's capital \u2014 call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers \u2014 is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward.",
      "Here's a look at how Trump has used troops in U.S. cities, what the law allows and what could come next:",
      "Trump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids.",
      "Besides 4,000 Guard members, Trump later sent 700 active duty Marines, and California sued over the intervention. The Guard went on to help protect officers during immigration arrests.",
      "While Trump pushed the limits of the law, the lawsuit centers on whether the president was allowed to use the Guard to closely shadow federal law enforcement and whether that runs afoul of the prohibition on using the military as law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act, said Todd Huntley, director of the National Security Law Program at the Georgetown University Law Center.",
      "Meanwhile, the unique status of the District of Columbia National Guard \u2014 Trump is their commander in chief \u2014 means he has been able to use it for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues. Because it is on state and not federal orders, legal restrictions on law enforcement don\u2019t come into effect.",
      "\u201cWhere we have a big question mark\u201d is whether \u201cthe governor of a state has to consent to the sending of troops to his state,\u201d said Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate.",
      "The Trump administration is planning to surge officers to the nation\u2019s third-largest city for an immigration crackdown, two U.S. officials said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, including with facilities and logistics, the base said this week. The Illinois National Guard and the base said they had not received requests regarding a mobilization of troops to Chicago.",
      "If Trump wants the freedom to use the National Guard as he pleases in Chicago, the easiest legal path is to invoke the Insurrection Act \u2014 a vaguely worded 1792 law that allows the president to deploy federal troops inside the U.S. to conduct law enforcement, an exception to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act.",

      "However, Huntley calls this \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d",
      "A D.C. National Guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said invoking the Insurrection Act over a broad topic like crime could allow the Guard to be deployed indefinitely.",
      "Another possibility is Trump deploying the D.C. Guard, which he commands, to another state, the official said.",
      "If the D.C. Guard is put on federal orders \u2014 something Trump has the power to do \u2014 it could lead to some rare situations, including federalized D.C. Guardsmen sent to another state that in turn could activate its own Guard as a counter, Huntley said.",
      "The possibility is not without precedent.",
      "\u201cThe resolution of that could be basically what we saw in Alabama during the civil rights era. To take the ability of that state governor of using state National Guard forces away, the president could simply federalize them,\u201d Huntley said.",
      "In 1963, President John F. Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard as part of the now-famous standoff with Gov. George Wallace, who refused to step aside and allow Black students to integrate the University of Alabama. Wallace eventually relented.",
      "In an executive order signed Monday, Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to create \u201ca specialized unit\" within the D.C. Guard \"dedicated to ensuring public safety and order.\u201d",
      "He also directed Hegseth to ensure every state\u2019s Guard is ready to assist federal and local law enforcement in \"quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order\u201d when needed.

      "The Pentagon has not given more details of what Trump's order will mean for the National Guard. A defense official confirmed that Hegseth\u2019s office was aware of the order and that they were reviewing it and its specific requirements.",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The federal criminal case against former Memphis police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols has taken a shocking, unusual twist: Three of them are getting a new trial because a judge made comments after their convictions that raised questions of bias.",
      "On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman ordered a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. They were found guilty in October 2024 of obstruction of justice through witness tampering in the January 2023 beating of Nichols after he fled a traffic stop. Two other officers involved in the beating pleaded guilty and avoided trial.",
      "Lipman wrote that U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the trial, raised \u201cthe risk of bias\u201d when he commented in May that at least one of the officers could be in a gang, and that gang may have been responsible for shooting his law clerk.",
      "Lipman's order also said an assistant U.S. attorney recalled that Norris told her shortly after the shooting that the Memphis Police Department was \u201cinfiltrated to the top with gang members.\u201d",
      "Norris recused himself from the case in June, just days before scheduled sentencings for the five officers. He has declined comment.",
      "If the case heads to trial again, defense attorneys, prosecutors, the officers and Nichols' family will have to relive the brutal beating and the grueling legal battle that has followed. It is unclear when a new trial would take place, again putting Memphis in the spotlight for a death that sparked a federal civil rights investigation into its police.",
      "Here is a look at the case, and what's next.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, officers yanked Nichols from his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place steps from his home.",
      "He died in a hospital three days later.",
      "Video of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. It prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith, along with Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., were fired. They were charged in state court with offenses including second-degree murder and in federal court with civil rights violations and obstructing justice.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were convicted in federal court of trying to cover up the beating by failing to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke police department rules when they did not include accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges.",
      "Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs, and also conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "This May, Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted of all state charges.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court.",
      "Martin and Mills also avoided a state court trial after reaching agreements to plead guilty.",
      "In her order, Lipman cited a notice by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office about Norris\u2019 reactions to his law clerk being shot during a car theft days after the federal trial ended. The clerk was staying at the home of another law clerk who had previously worked for Norris on the Nichols case, the notice said.",
      "Norris met with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and an FBI agent, who explained why no federal charges would be brought in the shooting.",

      "Norris indicated that he believed at least one of the former officers was in a gang and that it was responsible for the shooting, the notice said. Norris told those present that he believed the intended target of the shooting was the former law clerk who had worked on the case and \u201chad been seen by one or more of the Defendants during the trial,\u201d the notice added.",
      "The assistant U.S. attorney who attended the May 30 meeting recalled that Norris months earlier told her he could not meet with Memphis police to give a statement because the department was \u201cinfiltrated to the top with gang members,\u201d the notice said.",
      "Norris recused himself days after that meeting.",
      "Bean, Haley, and Smith sought a new trial, arguing that Norris was biased and violated their due process rights.",
      "While a review showed Norris\u2019 decisions throughout the trial were \u201csound, fair, and grounded firmly in the law,\u201d a new trial is necessary \u201cbecause the risk of bias here is too high to be constitutionally tolerable,\u201d Lipman wrote.",
      "Lipman has ordered lawyers to state what charges they believe need to be retried, and she set a Sept. 25 hearing.",
      "Charles Geyh, a law school professor at Indiana University and expert in judicial ethics, said it is already rare to get a new trial because of doubts that a judge could hear a case fairly. But Norris\u2019 broad comments make the scenario \u201chighly unusual,\u201d Geyh said.",
      "\u201cIn a case like this, it\u2019s rarer still where the judge steps back and generalizes about the police force and associates them with organized crime and gangs,\u201d Geyh said.",
      "David Raybin, a Nashville criminal defense attorney who has represented police officers, said there could be renewed plea bargaining, potentially for lower offenses, given that the three officers had been convicted on the lesser federal charges and acquitted in state court.",
      "\u201cThey may come to the table and say, \u2018Look, we want a deal, we want a better deal,\u2019 or whatever,\" said Raybin, who is not involved in the case. \"The prosecutors might say, \u2019Look, this case is snakebit. We maybe want to settle this case in some way.' \u201d",
      "Geyh said there\u2019s a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d Norris could publicly apologize.",
      "Geyh also said someone could file a disciplinary complaint. The process could lead to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals chief judge talking privately with Norris, who might agree to some corrective steps, Geyh said.",
      "Or the chief circuit judge could commission an investigative panel, with a judicial council potentially issuing up to a public reprimand, but likely nothing more severe, Geyh added.",
      "Norris already has been reassigned off other cases, including a $550 million lawsuit by Nichols\u2019 family against the five officers and the city of Memphis.",
      "Nichols' family members have not commented publicly on the new trial, and neither has their lawyer, Ben Crump.",
      "But throughout their ordeal, Nichols' relatives have expressed how difficult his death has been. During the trials, Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, and other relatives left the courtroom while jurors watched video of the beating.",
      "After the state court acquittals in May, Crump said: \u201cTyre\u2019s life was stolen, and his family was denied the justice they so deeply deserve. We are outraged, and we know we are not alone.\"",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:40:22 -0400",
    "summary": "A master of figurative art is now focused on the work of other artists, gifting a collection of more than 100 paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
    "story": [
      "When Alex Katz began painting more than 75 years ago, he ignored what was popular then, to pursue his passion: figurative art. \"Most people didn't like my work,\" he said. \"It was figurative, and everyone was abstract, and everything was pop art. But a lotta people didn't like it.\"",
      "But he says he didn't care that much what they thought: \"If they liked it, swell. And if they didn't like it, go to hell.\"",
      "Katz depicts recognizable figures and objects from the real world. Using unfussy backgrounds and large areas of color, he emphasizes shapes and outlines, and paints massive pieces, often with his wife, Ada, as his subject. \"I did the figures on a flat ground,\" he said. \"I did the double portraits of Ada. I did the big heads before anyone. And that's really aggressive. And the big compositions. No one had done anything like it.\"",
      "Katz grew up in Queens, New York, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. He's been honing his technique ever since.",
      "In 1986, \"Sunday Morning\" documented his artistic process:",
      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",

      "She chose September, that most excellent month, to make her move. The monsoon had receded, leaving Kerala gleaming like an emerald strip between the mountains and the sea. As the plane banked to land, and the earth rose to greet us, I couldn't believe that topography could cause such palpable, physical pain. I had never known that beloved landscape, never imagined it, never evoked it, without her being part of it. I couldn't think of those hills and trees, the green rivers, the shrinking, cemented-over rice fields with giant billboards rising out of them advertising awful wedding saris and even worse jewelry, without thinking of her. She was woven through it all, taller in my mind than any billboard, more perilous than any river in spate, more relentless than the rain, more present than the sea itself. How could this have happened? How? She checked out with no advance notice. Typically unpredictable.",
      "The church didn't want her. She didn't want the church. (There was savage history there, nothing to do with God.) So given her standing in our town, and given our town, we had to fashion a fitting funeral for her. The local papers reported her passing on their front pages, most national papers mentioned it, too. The internet lit up with an outpouring of love from generations of students who had studied in the school she founded, whose lives she had transformed, and from others who knew of the legendary legal battle she had waged and won for equal inheritance rights for Christian women in Kerala. The deluge of obituaries made it even more crucial that we do the right thing and send her on the way she deserved. But what was that right thing? Fortunately, on the day she died the school was closed and the children had gone home. The campus was ours. It was a huge relief. Perhaps she had planned that, too.",
      "Conversations about her death and its consequences for us, especially me, had begun when I was three years old. She was thirty then, debilitated by asthma, dead broke (her only asset was a bachelor's degree in education), and she had just walked out on her husband\u2014my father, I should say, although somehow that comes out sounding strange. She was almost eighty-nine when she died, so we had sixty years to discuss her imminent death and her latest will and testament, which, given her preoccupation with inheritance and wills, she rewrote almost every other week. The number of false alarms, close shaves, and great escapes that she racked up would have given Houdini pause for thought. They lulled us into a sort of catastrophe complacency. I truly believed she would outlive me. When she didn't, I was wrecked, heart-smashed. I am puzzled and more than a little ashamed by the intensity of my response.",

Our seventeenth-century lit class has only about thirty people, but Modern Furniture is held in an auditorium with cushioned seats set on a steep slope down to the professor at his podium. Behind him is a big screen that flashes pictures of Corbusier's B 306 chaise longue and Bauhaus nesting tables. I catch up on a lot of sleep in that class.",

    "summary": "YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, temporarily avoiding content blackout on streaming company's platform.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Beyond deals with YouTube TV and others, Fox last week launched its own streaming platform, \"Fox One,\" which has a starting price of $19.99 a month.",

      "Fans have been eager to learn everything they can about the engagement into the lead-up to this TBD white veil occasion.",
      "Here's what we know so far about your English teacher and gym teacher's engagement:",
      "When did Swift and Kelce get engaged?",
      "The couple announced their engagement on Aug. 26, 13 days after Swift's \"New Heights\" episode dropped. Fans were quick to speculate about when Kelce popped the question \u2014 and they didn't have to wait long before getting a timeline from Kelce's dad Ed, who told News 5 Cleveland that the couple got engaged roughly two weeks ago.",
      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",
      "\"He was going to make a big production out of it,\" Ed shared, explaining that Travis wanted it to be \"uber special.\"",
      "\"And I told him the same thing [Swift's dad] Scott told him: Asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it. You could do it on the side of the road.\"",
      "Ed said Swift's dad told him to \"just get it done.\"",
      "Where did Kelce pop the question?",
      "Kelce proposed on the grounds of his $6 million Missouri home, which he purchased back in 2023. The engagement photos show a dramatic display of flowers adorning an arch and surrounding the couple.",
      "Florist Ashley Greer told People Magazine that the \"enchanted garden\" scene, which featured thousands of flowers, likely cost nearly $40,000. Also featured \u2014 ivy and willow, a likely nod to two songs off Swift's ninth studio album, \"evermore.\"",
      "What do we know about the ring?",
      "Kelce skipped the paper rings and went for a custom old mine brilliant cut in a yellow gold bezel setting. Swift's representative said New York based goldsmith Kindred Lubeck, who specializes in hand engraving, designed the ring.",
      "Old mine brilliant cuts are often boxy shaped with rounded corners and soft curved edges. They usually have 58 large facets and the style dates to the 18th century. The bulky nature of the cut was intended to sparkle by candlelight.",
      "Where it all began",
      "As Swifties and Chief fans alike already know, their relationship began after Kelce's failed attempt to meet Swift at Arrowhead Stadium. He talked about the show in a July 2023 episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast, telling his brother Jason Kelce that he was disappointed that he wasn't able to give her a friendship bracelet he had made with his number on it.",

      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",

      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",

    "summary": "About 42% of the children in the study diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis.",
    "story": [
      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids.\"",

    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHC secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",

      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee announced a hearing next Thursday with Secretary Kennedy on President Trump's health care agenda. The proceeding was previously in the works prior to controversy, according to a committee aide, who noted the panel does not have jurisdiction over the CDC.",
      "A handful of congressional Democrats have called for Kennedy to resign or be fired over the mass exodus from the health agency.",
      "\"We cannot let RFK Jr. burn what's left of the CDC and our other critical health agencies to the ground\u2014he must be fired,\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/appeals-court-trump-tariffs-illegal/",
    "published": "Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:26:09 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

    "story": [
      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The top tourism official in Las Vegas says the city hasn't priced out regular travelers, even as July visitor counts fell and casinos took in more from gamblers.",
      "Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), said monthly figures can bounce around but argued the destination remains competitive at different price points.",
      "\"We're not happy with the downturn but the city's taking steps to address that,\" Hill told reporters Friday.",
      "Las Vegas saw a 12% decline in visitors compared to a year ago, hosting about 3.1 million people, according to LVCVA data.",
      "Convention attendance fell about 10% in June, then rose about 10% in July. Looking over a longer stretch, Hill said the meetings business is roughly flat and the next 16 months of bookings look especially strong.",
      "With social media griping about add-on costs, resorts are leaning into promotions.",
      "Recent examples include: Resorts World waiving resort fees and paid parking through Sept. 10, the Sahara Las Vegas Hotel offering free parking, late check-out and upgrades on select stays, Downtown Grand Hotel bundling dining credits, free slot play, no resort fee and The Strat touting \"Summer of Value\" rooms with taxes and fees included.",
      "The tourism agency is also pushing budget tips and free activities citywide.",
      "\"The idea that generally Las Vegas is not a value, that it is overpriced, I don't think our customers are doing math when they are concerned about a specific issue,\" Hill said. \"They're expressing concern about that specific topic, that tends to then move into a narrative around Las Vegas is expensive or Las Vegas is not a value, but if you actually do the math on that, that's not accurate.\"",
      "International travel remains mixed.",
      "Traffic from Canada is down about 18%, which Hill attributed in part to friction caused by politics and tariffs. By contrast, visits from Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia are rising, with more flights into Las Vegas.",
      "He also criticized a $250 U.S. visa fee for travelers from non-waiver countries, costs that can top $1,000 for a family of four, and long processing times that he said suppress demand.",
      "Despite the downward trend in overall visitors, Nevada gaming revenue remains resilient, a sign that visitors who do come are still spending.",
      "Nevada casinos kept $1.36 billion from gamblers in July, up 4% from a year earlier, according to data from state regulators.",
      "The Las Vegas Strip drove the increase with $749 million, a 5.6% gain. Downtown Las Vegas rose 3.6%.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:50:55 -0400",
    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, analysts say inflation could bare its teeth more in the coming months as U.S. tariffs start to trickle through the economy.",
      "\"We continue to expect tariffs to take a growing bite out of growth in real income and real consumer spending,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report.",
      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",
      "What does the latest inflation data mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "Most Wall Street analysts think the latest inflation figures keep the Fed on track to lower interest rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting.",
      "\"Today's numbers on both the personal consumption, expenditure, and income and spending, were right down the middle of the fairway,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B. Riley Wealth. \"This leaves the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates in September, and likely again in October and in December.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, the same as in June and in line with economist forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.9% from a year ago, up slightly from June's 2.8% and the highest since February, according to the report.",
      "The figures illustrate why many Fed officials\u00a0have been wary\u00a0about cutting their benchmark interest rate. While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it remains above the central bank's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, the report showed that consumer spending increased by 0.5% from June to July, the biggest increase since March, indicating that Americans are not pulling back on purchases, despite looming economic uncertainty. Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",
      "Incomes rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, boosted by a healthy gain in wages and salaries, the report showed.",

      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted in his Jackson Hole address earlier this month\u00a0that policymakers are likely to cut its short-term rate for the first time December of 2024.

      "President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0suspending what's known as the\u00a0de minimis exemption\u00a0late last month.",
      "At the time, the White House said that would close what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S.",
      "The exemption applied to parcels valued at $800 or less and let overseas retailers ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "Mr. Trump \"is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "The president \"ending of the deadly de minimum loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

    "summary": "Consumers interested in buying or leasing an EV should act before a federal tax credit expires on Sept. 30, according to auto experts.",
    "story": [
      "Labor Day is traditionally a cue for car dealers to roll out promotions as new model year vehicles arrive on the lot. And this year, some of the best deals are to be had on electric vehicle leases ahead of a $7,500 federal tax credit expiring on Sept. 30, according to auto research firm Edmunds.",
      "Data\u00a0from Kelley Blue Book shows EV prices have dropped steadily amid soft demand for electric cars. In July, the average sales price for a new EV was $55,689, down more than 4% from a year ago.",
      "The tax credit saves EV leaseholders an average of $208 a month spread across a 36-month lease, Edmund found in analyzing dealership transactions. Leasing has become the most common way consumers enter the EV market, according to the auto industry data provider, which found that leases made up 70% of all EV transactions in July.",
      "A $4,000 tax credit for used EVs also ends on Sept. 30.",
      "For most consumers, leasing an EV is a better bet than buying, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.",
      "\"If you've never tried this tech and want to dip your toe in the water instead of getting married to it,\" he said, noting that EVs tend to depreciate faster than gas-powered cars. \"That's because we know the tech will get better, and what you buy today won't be as good as what you get next year.\"",
      "The IRS is also giving consumers more wiggle room to claim the EV tax credit before it ends. Previously, eligibility was tied to a vehicle's delivery date. But the agency this month issued a notice clarifying that consumers are eligible for the credit if they sign a contract for a vehicle prior to Sept. 30 and make a payment, which can include putting money down or trading in a car \u2014 even if the vehicle isn't delivered until after that date.",
      "\"EVs fundamentally face an awareness issue, and if dealers and automakers don't get the word out, they risk disappointing customers who show up after September 30 only to find that the opportunity has passed,\" \u00a0Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' assistant vice president of insights, said in a statement.",
      "According to the U.S. Department of Energy, drivers of fully electric vehicles can save up to $2,200 per year on fuel.",

      "So are there simple ways for employees to reduce stress? Maisha Wynn, a CBS News\u00a0lifestyle contributor and author of \"The Wynning Way,\" told CBS News that workers should focus on channeling their energy.",
      "The first few hours of the work day are your \"high energy time,\" and thus good for more demanding tasks like Zoom calls, planning projects and participating in meetings.

An increase in stopping distance increases the risk of a crash.\"",
      "Ford said it will notify affected vehicle owners of the safety risk in early September. The remedy for the issue is still under development and is expected to be available in April.",
      "The recall comes after Ford this month also\u00a0recalled more than 355,000 pickup trucks over an instrument panel display failure.",

      "So concludes a new analysis from the Bank of America Institute, which drew on the deposit data from millions of its customers to track job changes and the median pay bump people get when they switch employers.",
      "The analysis shows that while the job change rate \u2014 defined in this case as the total percentage of Bank of America customers who have changed employers \u2014 has edged up this year, Americans are much less to likely switch jobs than during the \"Great Resignation.\" That was the period during the pandemic when a massive wave of workers quit their jobs, motivated by better work opportunities and work-life balance. Over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021, according to Labor Department data.",
      "The bank's data shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downwards, from 26% since the 2022 peak, and is now just slightly above the the job change rate in 2019. The upshot: As employers have pulled back in hiring, workers are hunkering down in their current jobs.",
      "\"It's possible that, again, tariffs and just general business uncertainty is playing a role in squeezing out some of the availability for people to switch jobs, which is why that rate is declining,\" said Taylor Bowley, an economist at Bank of America Institute and lead author of the report.",
      "The labor market slowed sharply in recent months. Accounting for government data revisions, the average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from average of 123,000 from January to April. The Labor Department will release the next jobs report on September 5.",
      "\"People are not leaving their jobs right now because they're nervous about the future of the labor market,\" said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed \"It's a pretty stagnant labor market,\" she added.",

      "ZipRecruiter labor economist Nicole Bachaud, citing data from the company's\u00a0New Hires Survey, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email that less than half of new hires (42%) in the second quarter negotiated their starting salary. Among those who did seek to negotiate, only 48% received higher pay.",
      "Federal Reserve data shows that for the first time since 2010, wage growth for job hoppers equaled that of job stayers in May and into July, another indication that the labor marketing is cooling.",
      "The Bank of America analysis notes the diminishing payoff from switching jobs stems in part from the shifting power dynamic between employees and employers. Workers wielded more leverage during the pandemic, when labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. However, that power is slowly shifting back toward employers as job opportunities dry up.",
      "\"This trend confirms that the labor market is no longer as tight,\" Bowley writes in the report.",
      "Uncertainty surrounding tariffs has also led employers to hold off on making major businesses investments, leading some to pause hiring altogether.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:02:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit challenging what her suit said is President Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove\" her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors puts the nation in uncharted legal waters, and may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to provide clarity on whether the move crosses a legal boundary, legal scholars expect.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to oust Cook comes after months of griping about the Fed, which he says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. But if her removal is allowed to stand \u2014 a question that will be decided by the courts \u2014 and the Senate confirms a replacement, it would mean Mr. Trump will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cook was named to the Fed Board by President Joe Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to serve a full 14-year term in September 2023, which is set to end in January 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was removing Cook from her post because of alleged mortgage fraud, though she has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense. The claims about Cook were made by Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who sent a\u00a0letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of\u00a0 taking out mortgages for properties in Michigan and Georgia in 2021 and claiming both would be used as her primary residence.",
      "Pulte alleged that Cook was fraudulently attempting to gain more favorable lending terms. He has also leveled allegations of mortgage fraud against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democrats who have been among the most prominent opponents of Mr. Trump. Both have denied the accusations.",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook has set off a legal battle that could end with the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. She filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging what the suit said is Mr. Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would [be] the first of its kind in the Board's history.\"",
      "\"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" her complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., states.",
      "The White House has defended Mr. Trump's move to terminate Cook from the Fed Board of Governors as within his lawful authority.",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Aggressive removals",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook is the latest in a string of removals of Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies, which have tested the bounds of his executive authority. He fired leaders of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, ousted commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and terminated officials sitting on the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Many of the firings have led to legal challenges. The officials removed from the boards have argued Mr. Trump violated federal laws that shield them from being removed at-will. Instead, Congress has said that the only grounds for their firings are inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The laws were meant to insulate independent federal agencies and decisions from political pressure.",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" But courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause.\" While not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, Cook argues in her lawsuit that it means instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or comparable misconduct.",
      "The question of what qualifies as good cause, and whether Cook's alleged actions rise to it, are likely to be key questions to be answered during litigation, said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If [the justices] interpret good cause, they'll have to do so with an eye to the power and purpose of the Federal Reserve System more generally, the powers of the system and the purpose of its independence. What is 'good cause' with respect to the service of a Fed governor?\" he said. \"If all President Trump is going to go with is these allegations regarding the governor's mortgage application before she was on the board, I have a hard time believing that constitutes good cause because it's really not germane to the duties of the governor while she was in office.\"",
      "The Supreme Court and the Fed",
      "In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause.",
      "In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "This year, in response to emergency appeals brought by ousted officials from the NLRB and the MSPB, which are multi-member bodies, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. Trump to fire those officials while their legal challenges move forward, even though Congress shielded them from being removed at will. But in a brief decision in that case that appeared to be 6-3, the Supreme Court's majority singled out the Fed.",
      "Two fired officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, raised concerns about the consequences of allowing their removals and whether that would call into question the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause removal protections. The court said it disagreed. Instead, it called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",
      "Writing in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority created a \"bespoke Federal Reserve exception,\" even though its independence \"rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on.\"",
      "\"The court in that language does not resolve the question. All the court is saying is that the Federal Reserve is different from the FTC or from the NLRB,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said. \"Yeah, it is different, but is it sufficiently different to mean that it's not subject to the same rule? The court doesn't say.\"",
      "The president's removal powers",
      "While Mr. Trump has sought to exert new levels of control over the executive branch, the Supreme Court has recognized narrow exceptions to the removal powers, allowing Congress to protect certain officials from being fired without cause.",
      "In a 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the court found that Congress can restrict the president's authority to remove multi-member commissions of experts who are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In its decision allowing the firings of the labor board members, the Supreme Court's majority said the Justice Department \"is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.\"",
      "But White said the Fed is different from those agencies because of the authority it exerts.",
      "\"Under the last 15 years of precedents, the question is what kind of powers does the agency wield and are they substantially executive?\" he said. \"And for the Fed, it does have regulatory powers and it's possible they verge on something like executive power, but the overwhelming majority of what the Fed does that is of consequence is its monetary powers. That's why the court recognized that the Fed is different.\"",
      "White continued: \"The whole reason why we're sensitive about the president's attacks on the Fed versus the NLRB is that the Fed's overwhelming purpose and its most significant power are all something very different than simple law enforcement policy. Those powers, going back to the very beginning of the country, have never been treated as executive powers.\"",
      "Alicea, however, disagreed. The Board of Governors has broad oversight and regulatory authority over the nation's banking system, he said.",
      "\"Those are core executive powers,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook filed suit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors on Thursday, asking a federal judge to block the president's attempt to fire her from the central bank.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Cook's termination from the Fed late Monday, citing allegations she had committed mortgage fraud, which he described as \"deceitful and potentially criminal.\" The move came after the president spent months railing against the Fed and Powell for leaving interest rates relatively high so far this year.",
      "Cook filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, teeing up a legal showdown that seems destined to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Her legal team asked the district court to declare that Mr. Trump's attempted firing is \"unlawful and void\" and that Cook \"remains an active member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Governor Cook seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of Governors, safeguard her and the Board's congressionally mandated independence, and allow Governor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work,\" the suit said.",
      "Members of the Fed board are confirmed by the Senate and serve for 14-year terms. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president can only remove them early \"for cause.\" The law doesn't specify what qualifies as \"cause,\" and it has never been tested in court, but it is generally understood to be malfeasance.",
      "In her suit, Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen asked the court to state that Fed board members \"can only be removed for cause, meaning instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct,\" citing Supreme Court precedent and relevant federal law. Even if the court disagrees with that standard, they wrote, the law \"clearly does not support removal for policy disagreements.\"",
      "Powell and the Fed board are named in the suit because Cook asked the court for an injunction ordering them to \"refrain from effectuating President Trump's illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the president \"exercised his lawful authority\" in removing Cook.",
      "\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the past that the president has the legal right to remove at will members of federal boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Trump's power to fire some board members, but said in May that the Federal Reserve is a separate case, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage documents by claiming two homes that she bought in 2021 as her primary residence. He alleged that Cook \u2014 an economist who has served on the Fed board since 2022 \u2014 had committed mortgage fraud, and referred the matter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department special attorney Ed Martin.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump publicly called on Cook to resign.",
      "At the time, Cook didn't address the substance of Pulte's allegations directly, but said in a statement that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\" She added that she would \"take any questions about my financial history seriously\" and said she was gathering more information.",
      "Lowell, her lawyer, said Monday that Mr. Trump didn't have the legal right to fire Cook \"based solely on a referral letter\" to Justice Department leadership, a point her legal team reiterated in Thursday's lawsuit.",
      "\"[R]emoval 'for cause' requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on an unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to her Senate confirmation),\" the complaint said. \"And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular officer's official conduct in certain cases, 'cause' requires a factual basis supporting such asserted misconduct.\"",
      "The broadside against Cook came as Mr. Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank's rate-setting committee \u2014 which Cook and Powell both sit on \u2014 has opted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, fearing that inflation could resurge. Last week, Powell hinted that the central bank may cut rates soon, but it will \"proceed carefully.\"",
      "The president favors immediate rate cuts, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow money, though at the risk of causing higher inflation. He has floated firing Powell at various times over the past few months and has encouraged other Fed officials to overrule him and slash rates.",
      "The Fed typically makes interest rate decisions independently. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize the Fed for leaving rates high, but he's been unusually assertive. Last year, he argued he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "Many experts believe it's important for central banks to operate independently so they can make decisions based on economic data, not politics. If elected officials are in charge of monetary policy, they could opt for the politically popular short-term benefits of low interest rates \u2014 like a hotter economy and cheaper borrowing costs \u2014 even if that leads to higher inflation in the long run, Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel noted earlier this year.",

      "The Commerce Department said Thursday that the country's gross domestic product \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 grew at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter after shrinking 0.5% in the first three months of 2025. The agency had initially estimated second-quarter growth at 3%.",
      "\"There was an upward revision to business investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property, as well as consumer spending,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Investment related to AI is helping mask some of the weakness elsewhere in the economy, but the good news is that there is little sign that this support is set to fade anytime soon.\"",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP as businesses scrambled to bring in foreign goods ahead of new U.S. tariffs taking effect. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter. Imports fell at a 29.8% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "Concerns about the health of the economy have grown amid recent signs of a cooldown in hiring across the U.S., with employers adding a weaker than expected 73,000 jobs in July. Investors expect Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next policy meeting in September in a bid to shore up economic growth.",
      "\"While the US economy grew at an upwardly revised annualized rate of 3.3% in Q2 2025, the strength was largely a mirage, reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in response to tariffs in Q1,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "The economy grew at an average rate of only 1.4% in the first six months of the year, Daco noted, pointing to weak private-sector demand outside of an ongoing surge of investment in AI.",
      "According to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow forecasting tool, the economy is growing at 2.2% clip this year."

      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",

      "Secretarial and administrative work",

      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Beyond deals with YouTube TV and others, Fox last week launched its own streaming platform, \"Fox One,\" which has a starting price of $19.99 a month.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/car-buying-mistakes-to-avoid-edmunds-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A 2025 analysis from Edmunds reveals that nearly 20% of new car buyers are committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a new car has never been more financially daunting. A 2025 analysis from Edmunds found that a record 19.3% of consumers who financed a new vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 committed to a monthly payment of $1,000 or more. That's nearly one in five buyers taking on what was once considered an extreme car payment \u2014 driven by high interest rates and rising vehicle prices.",
      "While it might be tempting to stretch your budget for the car you want, locking yourself into a high-cost loan can be a painful mistake. Before you sign, here are five common car-buying missteps to avoid.",
      "1. Buying outside your means",
      "There's a difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford it wisely. With an average new vehicle transaction price of approximately $49,000, many buyers are truly stretching their budgets. It's not uncommon to see buyers opt for extended 72-month or 84-month financing terms.",
      "That shiny SUV might seem within reach thanks to flexible financing, but the long-term hit to your financial health could be considerable. Buying within your means \u2014 ideally targeting a loan term of no more than 60 months and keeping your car-related expenses under 15%-20% of your monthly take-home pay \u2014 is smart shopping in an era of rising interest rates and ever-increasing car prices.",
      "2. Getting a dealership loan",
      "One of the most costly and common mistakes car buyers make is waiting until they're sitting in the dealership finance office to think about a loan. Dealerships may offer convenience, but their financing may include marked-up interest rates or hidden fees.",
      "Instead, walk into the dealership with a preapproved loan offer from your bank, credit union or an online lender. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this move can save buyers hundreds to thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. When you do this, the dealer can still try to beat the rate \u2014 and sometimes will. But now you're negotiating from a position of strength, not desperation.",
      "3. Trading in a car with negative equity",
      "If you owe more on your current car than it's worth \u2014 a situation known as negative equity \u2014 trading it in for a new vehicle can be a financial landmine. This commonly happens when people take out a six-year loan, trade in the vehicle after just three or four years, and carry the previous balance into the new vehicle. Rolling that deficit into a new loan just worsens the problem, guaranteeing that you'll be underwater for even longer.",
      "According to Edmunds, 28.2% of trade-ins in July 2025 involved negative equity, and the average amount buyers owed above the vehicle's value was $6,902. That sets the stage for a vicious cycle, especially if buyers trade cars frequently or face unexpected job loss or repair costs. If you're in this situation, consider keeping your car longer or making extra payments. If you can get a better rate, even refinancing can get you back to breakeven.",
      "4. Not working with internet sales team first",
      "Most major dealerships now have dedicated internet sales teams that exist to sell you a car quickly and often at better prices than you'll get face-to-face. If you already know what make, model and trim you want, you can save hours \u2014 and hundreds or even thousands of dollars \u2014 by working with the internet sales department instead of walking onto the lot.",
      "Sites such as Edmunds can help you compare pricing between multiple dealers, and many will show you real-time inventory, rebates and incentives. This lets you shop from the comfort of home and make dealers compete for your business. It also gives you a written quote you can bring with you \u2014 a powerful tool when negotiating.",
      "5. Overlooking used car options",
      "Buying new is tempting \u2014 it smells great, it's under warranty, and no one else has touched it. But it's not always the smartest financial move. Today's certified pre-owned vehicles often come with extended factory warranties, undergo rigorous inspections, and cost thousands less than their new counterparts. The rapid depreciation of most new vehicles only worsens the picture. Most lose 20%\u201330% of their value in the first year alone, according to Edmunds. Avoiding that depreciation hit can save thousands.",
      "Buying a new car is one of the biggest financial decisions most people make \u2014 second only to purchasing a home. Avoiding these five common mistakes won't just save you money \u2014 it has the potential to help ensure your long-term financial security. Take your time and do your homework. The right deal isn't just about the car \u2014 it's about the life you want to live after you drive it off the lot.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 15:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Cracker Barrel decided to scrap the new logo entirely and keep the original design. \"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the company\u00a0announced\u00a0on social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "The decision came after President Trump on Tuesday publicly urged the company to ditch the new logo. \"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "Much of the initial uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Cracker Barrel's stock price was up roughly 5% ahead of the start of trade on Wednesday, helping erase the company's earlier market loss.",
      "Tom Murphy, a branding expert and professor at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch that he thinks Cracker Barrel did the right thing in backtracking on its logo rollout.",
      "\"The decision by Cracker Barrel to return to its original logo is a positive course correction, given the intensity of emotional response from their core base of customers,\" he said. \"This gives them an opportunity to reinforce the fact that they are not moving away from their brand purpose or their heritage.\"",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts panned Cracker Barrel's attempt at overhauling its logo.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "According to a recent YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 76% of those polled said they prefer the company's old logo to the new one.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Murphy, the Clark University branding expert, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

The study sheds light on some alternative pathways to a high-paying career that don't require a four-year degree.",
      "\"This report is pretty clear proof that you don't have to go to college to earn a really substantial income, and if you are considering a different route, there is plenty of reason to believe that in an awful lot of fields you can be every bit as successful, and every bit financially stable without that college degree,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 5.7 million, or 9%, of non-college graduates earning six-figure salaries worked in a range of fields, including software development, truck driving, elevator repair and more, according to the study. The report comes as many young people question the cost and value of a college degree, and evaluate whether the rewards are worth taking on the substantial student debt earning a degree often requires.",
      "Over the past 10 years, young workers without a bachelor's degree have seen their earnings increase, according to a 2024\u00a0study from the Pew Research Center. Amid rising tuition costs and mounting student debt, 29% of U.S. adults say the cost of college is not worth it, according to the research.",
      "The unemployment rate for young people who recently earned a college degree was close to 6% earlier this year, above the national average of 4.2%. That's in part because a growing number of employers are turning to artificial intelligence to perform tasks formerly done by entry-level workers, according to economists.",
      "Jobs than can pay $100,000 without a college degree",
      "At least 40% of workers without bachelor's degrees in 2023 earned six figures in 20 occupations, according to Lending Tree. They included software developers, sales engineers, aircraft pilots, air traffic controllers and others.",
      "Chief executives who never graduated from college were also on Lending Tree's list, with 64% earning at least six figures. To be sure, the study doesn't suggest that young workers should expect to ascend to executive-level positions without college degrees. Rather, the high share of non-college degree holders earning six figures as CEOs likely represents workers who have started their own businesses, according to Schulz.",
      "\"It speaks to the opportunity that can come from starting a small business today,\" he said. \"You're not necessarily talking about Fortune 500 companies.\"",

      "With the current agreement between the sides nearing a renewal deadline, YouTube TV could pull Fox sports, business and news channels from its platform by 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "In a blog post, Google-owned YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan, which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels, costs $82.99 a month.",
      "A spokesperson for Google did not have any additional comments when reached Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said Wednesday that it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" The broadcast giant added that it remained committed to reaching an agreement, but was alerting viewers that they could potentially lose access to Fox programming on YouTube TV \"unless Google engages in a meaningful way soon.\"",
      "Fox directed subscribers to keepfox.com \u2014 a site noting that, in addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network, which is majority-owned by Fox, if a deal isn't reached.",

      "President Donald Trump had initially announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods. But earlier this month he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff due to India's purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its ally to 50%.",

    "summary": "The plaintiffs in this case are 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 who entered the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a deportation order, just hours after lawyers alerted her of what they described as a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued her order as the deportation effort was fully underway, with planes with migrant children on board ready to take off from Texas.",
      "Earlier Sunday, in the overnight hours, Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order barring officials from sending a group of 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 to Guatemala, granting a request from attorneys who alleged the effort would skirt legal protections Congress established for these minors. She also scheduled a hearing in the afternoon to weigh the case's next steps.",
      "But Sooknanan abruptly moved up the hearing earlier on Sunday, saying she had been alerted that some migrant children were already in the process of being deported.",
      "As that hearing got underway, Sooknanan  announced she had just issued a broader temporary restraining order blocking any deportations of unaccompanied children from Guatemala and in U.S. custody who did not have a deportation order. She instructed Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, to quickly inform officials they had to halt their deportation plans.",
      "Ensign acknowledged deportation planes had been prepared to take off on Sunday, but said they were all \"on the ground\" and still on U.S. soil. He said he believed one plane had taken off earlier but had come back.",
      "At the request of Sooknanan, Ensign said he confirmed that the children on the planes would be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for migrant minors who enter the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "The Justice Department said 76 unaccompanied children were slated to be sent to Guatemala on Sunday before the effort was blocked. Of those, 16 had been returned to HHS custody as of Sunday evening and the rest were expected to be in HHS care by 10:30 p.m.",
      "HHS houses unaccompanied children in shelters or foster homes until they turn 18 or until they can be placed with a suitable sponsor in the U.S., who are often family members.",
      "Sooknanan conceded her temporary restraining order, which is set to last 14 days, is \"extraordinary\" but justified it on the grounds that the government had decided to \"execute a plan to remove these children\" in the \"wee hours\" of a holiday weekend.",
      "In their lawsuit, lawyers for the group of Guatemalan children said the Trump administration had launched an effort to deport more than 600 migrant minors to Guatemala without allowing them to request humanitarian protection, even though U.S. law protects them from speedy deportations. They alleged the children could face abuse, neglect or persecution if returned to Guatemala.",
      "Ensign, the Justice Department attorney, said the Trump administration was not trying to formally deport the Guatemalan children under U.S. immigration law, but instead repatriate them to Guatemala so they could reunite with relatives there. He said the Guatemalan government and the children's relatives had requested the reunifications.",
      "But lawyers for the children disputed the government's claims, citing one case in which they say a child's parents did not request any repatriation. They also said a law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act says unaccompanied migrant children who are not from Mexico must be allowed to see an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before any deportation effort.\u00a0 Some of the children facing return to Guatemala still have pending immigration cases, the attorneys said.",
      "Ensign said the government's legal position is that it can \"repatriate\" these children, based on authority given to HHS to reunite \"unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.\"",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deportation plans.",
      "Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law who works with migrant minors, said the U.S. government was attempting to deport children with \"already filed claims for legal relief based on the abuse and persecution that they experienced in their home country.\"",
      "\"This is both unlawful and profoundly inhumane,\" Desai added.",
      "Most of the unaccompanied children who cross the U.S. southern border without legal permission hail from Central America and tend to be teenagers. Once in the U.S., many file applications for asylum or other immigration benefits to try to stay in the country legally, such as a visa for abused, abandoned or neglected youth.",
      "As part of its larger crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump administration has sought to make drastic changes to how the U.S. processes unaccompanied children. It has made it harder for some relatives, including those in the country illegally, to sponsor unaccompanied children out of government custody and offered some teenagers the option to voluntary return to their native countries.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies to conduct \"welfare checks\" on children released from HHS custody, a move it has said is in response to disputed claims that the Biden administration \"lost\" hundreds of thousands of migrant minors.",
      "There are currently roughly 2,000 migrant children in HHS care.",

      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CBS News the Trump administration has not communicated with his state on a reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, calling the idea an \"invasion\" and arguing President Trump has \"other aims\" aside from cracking down on crime.",
      "Asked about a possible military deployment to America's third-largest city, which was recently reported by The Washington Post, Pritzker told CBS News: \"It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2014 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed National Guard forces and federal agents to the streets of two other major cities \u2014 Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 in recent months, part of what the president casts as a crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "Last week, the president said his administration could take similar steps in Chicago. Mr. Trump called the city a \"mess\" and lashed out against Mayor Brandon Johnson, saying, \"We'll straighten that one out probably next.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is planning major immigration enforcement operations in Chicago that could start as soon as next week, echoing a similar operation in Los Angeles, sources told CBS News. And The Washington Post has reported that the Pentagon is drawing up plans to potentially send thousands of National Guard members to the Midwest's largest metro area as early as September \u2014 though those plans haven't been publicly confirmed.",
      "Pritzker told CBS News that, if Mr. Trump sends the Guard to Chicago, voters \"should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime.\"",
      "The governor argued that the president's gambit may be part of a plan to \"stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\"",
      "He also called the idea \"an attack on the American people.\"",
      "\"Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No,\" Pritzker said in an interview with CBS News in Chicago.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson rejected Pritzker's accusations and blasted the city's violent crime rate.",
      "\"It's amazing the lengths this slob will go to in order to deflect from the terrible crime crisis that has been plaguing Chicago for years,\" Jackson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Chicago's residents would be much safer if Pritzker actually did his job and addressed his crime problem instead of trying to be a Resistance Lib hero.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Saturday evening, Mr. Trump called Pritzker a \"weak and pathetic Governor\" who \"just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!\"",
      "On Friday, Pritzker, asked whether he was suggesting that the president is an authoritarian, pointed to Germany's history. He noted that he built a Holocaust museum and knows \"what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned, after an election, in 53 days.\" Pritzker added that he's \"very, very concerned.\"",
      "\"We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know,\" Pritzker said. \"And I can tell you that- that the playbook is the same: It's thwart the media, it's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happen throughout history, and Donald Trump is just following that playbook.\"",
      "The Illinois governor said that he plans to \"do everything I can to stop him from taking away people's rights and from using the military to invade states,\" referencing Mr. Trump. He added that it's \"very important for us all to stand up.\"",
      "The Guard deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. have drawn stiff pushback from elected officials who argue local police are better able to handle crime, and warn the presence of federal agents and military personnel could inflame tensions.",
      "Future military deployments could also draw legal challenges. While Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard outright, the governors of the 50 states typically control their own Guard forces except in certain circumstances.",
      "The Trump administration deployed thousands of California National Guard members to Los Angeles over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections in June, arguing they were necessary to protect federal immigration agents and facilities from tense protests in the city.",
      "The state of California sued the administration, calling the deployment illegal. An appeals court found that Mr. Trump likely did have the legal authority to call up the state's National Guard, under a law that lets the president call Guard forces into federal service during a \"rebellion\" or if he isn't able to \"execute the laws of the United States.\" A lower court is still reviewing whether military forces in Los Angeles were inappropriately used for law enforcement purposes.",

I want to start with the fact that we've now learned the Trump administration is preparing to launch what they call major immigration enforcement here in Chicago in the coming days. The Homeland Security Secretary on Friday suggested, quote \"going to use LA as an example.\" So that mix of federal agents deploying with the assistance of National Guard troops potentially, to protect them and federal property. What's your response to those apparent plans?",
      "GOV. JB PRITZKER: Well, they've been here before, ICE has, scaring the communities across the city of Chicago. Frankly, right here in Little Village, businesses had to close, people had to stay home- people who are U.S. citizens, by the way, because they're afraid of being snatched off the streets and disappeared by people wearing masks and throwing them into vans. So the people of Chicago know what this looks like and are prepared. We hope that they don't send any troops along with ICE, and if they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do- you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If they're doing federal immigration work, a judge might say, if they're protecting those federal agents, that's okay. I mean, you'll just fight that in court as long as you can?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, National Guard troops- any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don't belong unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Have you been briefed by anyone in the administration about these plans?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: No one in the administration, the President, or anybody under him, has called anyone in my administration or- and me, have not called the city of Chicago or anyone else. So it's clear that, in secret, they're planning this- well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that. The other thing is, you know, they ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they're coming, where they're coming, if it's ICE or if it's ATF or whoever it is. But, they don't want to do that either and I must say, it's disruptive, it's dangerous. It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are, and when we can't coordinate with them.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're speaking with Homeland Security Secretary Noem on Sunday. If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, I'd tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused. We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear? Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing. So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American. And I would tell her to maybe check herself for what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical of the fact that Chicago is one of those cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations and she was quoted as saying that Illinois, quote, \"refuses to have our back.\"",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here. People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know, freedom to express and we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the- nobody has their backs. What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort, that is to say they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city and by the way, we're succeeding at that job, but when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The President has had some things to say about the Windy City several times in recent days. \"Next it should be Chicago.\" \"Chicago is a killing field right now.\" \"Everybody knows Chicago is a hell hole right now. Everybody knows it.\" Your reaction?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: You know, he wakes up in the morning and whatever whim strikes him is what he apparently says and recently, I guess I've been living rent free in his head. Chicago apparently is living rent free in his head, even though, on other days he'll talk about Baltimore, he'll talk about New York. Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states. Illinois is not even in the bottom half of states in terms of violent crime. Indeed, we're in the best half of the states so- but do you hear him talking about Florida, where he is now from. No, you don't hear him talking about that, or Texas. Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places, and we're very proud of the work that we've done. And we want more help. You know what kind of help we want? Civilian law enforcement help. We would like ATF agents to help us take more guns off the streets. We would like FBI, again, to coordinate with our local law enforcement to help catch perpetrators of crimes. If they would do that, we would welcome that. But that's not what they're planning to do. What they're planning to do is send troops into the city of Chicago, not because they want to fight crime, but because Donald Trump has other intentions.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So bottom line would more federal agents in Chicago, assisting local law enforcement help deter crime right now?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Of course, you want to help us catch bad guys? Bring the FBI, bring the ATF. We already coordinate with them, by the way. We do a lot of work with them. We do some- we do drug interdiction, we do- fighting gangs, and we do, you know, interdiction of guns at the borders. I want to point out, by the way, what- if Donald Trump really wants to help us, what he would do is pass universal background checks for guns. We have that in the state of Illinois, but no state around us has it. How about having it on a federal level? Because that would help keep guns off the streets.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 And part of the reason I ask about the potential for federal deployments to help right now is that according to a CBS News data analysis of what's gone on in Washington just in the last few weeks, while crime there as well was down and in most cases down double digits. It's down nearly 50 percent in the three weeks since the National Guard moved in. It's also down 41 percent, homicides down 69 percent, robbery down 63 percent, and the mayor concedes carjacking, which would become a bigger problem, down 83 percent since the federal agents showed up. So this kind of deployment he's set up in Washington, that he says he wants to do in other cities, at least in Washington, is showing potential success. And what I hear you saying is, well, sure, if they show up, it might help us, too?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities. That's un-American, and frankly, the President of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 But if he just sends the FBI, the ATF, DEA--",
      "GOV. PRITZKER:\u00a0 -- Yeah, they're here already --",
      "ED O'KEEFE: -- And he sends more of them.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: We have some working with us now. Would love more help. You know what else he's doing? He's cutting funds that help us to fight violent crime from the federal government.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Give me an example of how those cuts have affected the ability to fight crime in Chicago.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: So, let me just tell you what happened in Illinois when we had a Republican governor and he cut funding for programs that helped prevent crime. What happened was we saw a significant increase in crime. When you cut, for example, those programs that help to interdict crime, right, that help the- give kids summer jobs and so on. When you cut those programs, crime goes up. Our Republican governor, who preceded me, did that and what do you know? Crime went up. Donald Trump is now doing the same thing. He's taking away federal funding for those programs which are so important to us. We've increased funding at the state level, but we need that federal funding. It's on top of that. One more thing, the business community in the city of Chicago got together and put $100 million forward to help us, back in 2022, to help us to fight crime through these prevention programs. It's working. Crime is down. I mean, murders are down 50 percent in the city of Chicago and you can go through every statistic, almost everything is much better as a result of that work. Donald Trump is trying to take that money away. And he isn't listening to the business community here. He isn't listening to the clergy here. He isn't listening to people on the ground, Republicans here who understand that putting troops on the city of Chicago's streets is going to cause more problems than he understands.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 Have you called him or anyone at the White House to say there's no need to come?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I think I've been pretty clear publicly--",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 Well, it's one thing to be clear to us, why not pick up the phone?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: If he wants to send troops, he should call. I've been very clear about what it is that we'd like help with. But, instead, he's talking about sending troops. Nobody's called, literally nobody from the White House. Nobody from the federal government has called anybody in our administration or the city of Chicago. If they actually wanted to help, they might call and say, what help do you need? I think I've been pretty clear about what help we need. I don't know why they haven't bothered to reach out if they have plans of their own, but honestly, we'd be happy to receive a call.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But you see no need to call yourself and say, what is this all about? Here's what I would like instead?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: When we have an emergency and we need the federal government to send troops in, believe me, I will pick up the phone and call. That is not something going on in Chicago today.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You know, there's another example of how you could potentially be responding to this, and there's no question that what he's talking about is unprecedented. But we've already seen now another state, California, say they're going to be sending teams of state police into major cities. Sounds like it might be to thwart potential federal deployments. Is that something you would consider? Sending Illinois State Police into the streets to help deter crime?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: We do that all the time. We have Illinois State Police- I have the best state police in the country. And, in fact, they coordinate with the Chicago Police Department and police departments all across the state of Illinois to do exactly that, to make sure that we're bringing crime down. They've been very successful.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I long wondered, his focus on Chicago, do you think that has anything to do with the fact that back in the day, he had a business relationship with your extended family in the hotel business? There was a conflict, for example, in New York over a Hyatt Hotel. He has real estate, obviously, here in the city. I mean, could that be part of it? He mentioned, for example, this past week, I'm in the hotel business. His family's in the hotel business. Is there something from that that might cause this?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I don't know, but I'm not in the hotel business. I'm not engaged in that and I was--",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I said extended family, right.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: \u2013 a kid. I was a kid when he was doing any business back then. So all I can say is that, for some reason, he's got it in his head that he should be attacking the city of Chicago. We won't stand for it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What do you think it's going to do to the country if that happens? Deploying in Washington, where he has federal control, is one thing, but if he sends military forces into a major American city- in a state that didn't ask for it, beyond Los Angeles, what do Americans make of that?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, they should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime. That's the first thing they should understand. The second is, it's an attack on the American people by the President of the United States. Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No. And think about what- think about what he says. He says he's sending troops to fight crime. Are any of the red states that vote for him- voted for him, seeing troops in their states, and yet they have higher crime rates than the city of Chicago? No.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said he has other aims. What are the other aims?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: The other aims are that he'd like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections. He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he's allowed to do this. We have sovereignty. There's a 10th Amendment in the United States, and it says that the states have sovereignty. Our laws are supreme unless there is a federal law that supersedes it. Our National Guard should be under the control of our governors. When the President calls up the National Guard, in my entire lifetime, that has only been to either enforce a federal law, in the case of 1965, as you're aware, that was done, or to send them, as regularly happens, happened under Biden, happened under every president my lifetime, to send them abroad to fight for this country, because they're trained to go to war. They're trained to protect the country. They're not trained to do law enforcement on the street.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I hear you talking about invasion, I hear you talking about- I hear you talking about him suspending elections. Are you suggesting- is it your belief he's an authoritarian?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Look, I can tell you this. I built a Holocaust Museum. I know what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned, after an election, in 53 days. And I'm very, very concerned. We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know. And I can tell you that- that the playbook is the same. It's thwart the media, it's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happen throughout history, and Donald Trump is just following that playbook.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: On guns real quick, you've passed and signed some pretty significant firearms legislation this summer here in Illinois. How does that legislation help stop shootings at churches and schools from happening?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, we've banned assault weapons in the state of Illinois. We've banned bump stocks. We've banned switches that turn a regular gun into, essentially, an automatic weapon. These are all things that reduce the number of shootings. And by the way, guess what? Shootings are down significantly in the city of Chicago and across the state of Illinois. And again, I very much believe that people who have a right to own a gun should be able to go get one, but that you've got to have universal background checks. You've got to make sure that you're not selling guns that give someone the ability to commit a mass attack, in a school or anywhere else. But people have a right to protect themselves. There's a second amendment and I believe that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said you're having some issues with the states around Illinois, right?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, yeah. There's not a single state around Illinois that has universal background checks. Don't we think we ought to make sure that people who buy guns should have a right to own a gun, and that we shouldn't have people who have significant mental health issues, or a felony record that should keep them from owning a gun?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: There appears to be a bit of a divide in your party about how to approach the President. You either fight back, don't cooperate, don't show up for meetings with him, or you find ways to seek common ground and do things on behalf of your state. I think I know the answer to this, but where do you come down on how Democrats should be engaging the White House?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I think I've been pretty clear, since the very beginning, that I know who Donald Trump is, I know what his aims are, and they're not good for the American people. They're not good for the people of Illinois. And so, yeah, I've been standing up to Donald Trump, and I'm going to do everything I can to stop him from taking away people's rights and from using the military to invade states. I think it's very important for us all to stand up. I've called for people to get out in the streets, use their megaphones and their microphones, make sure they go to the ballot box to vote. That's been my attitude toward Donald Trump, and that's what I think people should be doing all across the country.",
      "ED O'KEEFE Does the next Democratic presidential nominee, though, need to campaign to promise to undo everything he's done?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Oh, I don't know. I'm not thinking about- that's too far away. Let's talk about the 2026 election.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You're running for reelection.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I am running for reelection.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Can a voter walk into the booth in Illinois knowing that you're going to serve a full term if you're reelected to a third term?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I'm- I've been in office now for six-and-a-half years. I have dedicated myself, myself entirely to the state of Illinois, and I always will. I don't know what the future holds. What I can tell you is I'm totally dedicated to upholding the rights of people in the state of Illinois and making sure that we're protecting them, especially from a tyrant who's taken over the White House.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But you- are you planning to run for President right now?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: My plan is to run for reelection as governor of the state.",
      "ED O'KEEFE Is it something you think about at least?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: You know, I look around, we've got a bench among the Democratic Party that is really terrific. I could point to governors. I could point to senators. I think there are a lot of good choices. I can just say that there, you know, there's no reason for us not to be thinking about all of those choices and thinking about what is it that the American people really want? What they want is to be able to go to the grocery store and afford things. They want to be able to buy a house. They want to be able to get a good job, and those are things that Democrats are fighting for. Republicans with tariffs, with fighting against the middle class by giving a massive tax cut to the wealthiest, while taking away Medicaid and food assistance, where clearly, Republicans are not on the side of average working people in the United States.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: When we talk about the bench. Is it responsible, is it accurate to put you on that bench?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: What's accurate is that we've got a terrific group of people who could be President of the United States, on the Democratic side, and I'm happy to stand with them as we stand against Donald Trump.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I'm acknowledging that they're trying to get us to wrap up and so I just have like two more so they can calm down. One of the- when people start looking at the future field and your name comes up and you're familiar with this, they go, well, yes, successful Midwestern governor, but he's a billionaire whose family made its money in hotels. Is a guy who's a billionaire because his family made money in hotels and other successful companies, the answer to the Democratic Party's future? Especially when the base of your party is so worried about issues like income inequality and the rich getting away with things that the working class doesn't?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: You know, people asked that question when I ran for governor back in 2018, and I think what I've proven to them is, first of all, I won by a significant margin, almost 16 percent in the state. Second, what I've proven to them is that I stand up for working people and the most vulnerable in our society, that I am a true blue Democrat who's been fighting for the rights of women, the rights of minorities, making sure that we're doing everything that we can to keep the people of Illinois safe. And I think that's why I got reelected, also by double digits, and I hope to get reelected again next year.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 And bottom line it for us, is there any chance Illinois redraws its congressional lines before next year's midterm elections?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: That's not something that I want to do. It's not something that any of us want to do. But I have to say, if Donald Trump is going to force his will on the American people by going to his MAGA allies in various states and have they- having them redraw in the middle of a decade, when you're supposed to be doing it right after a census, with a year ending in one, not a year ending in five. If he's going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What much- what much more could you do, though, as an Illinois Democrat? I mean, your map already gets an F from most good government groups for being gerrymandered. Would you wipe out all the Republican districts?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: We've had a lot of very successful candidates in the state, and I can tell you this, that, yeah, it is possible to have more democratic districts in the state of Illinois, and we- we could do it. Like I said, it's not something that I want to do, and I'd like it to stop here. I know Texas is now signing this map into law, the governor of Texas. We know how much he cares about the country, not at all. And we're now going to see it in California, probably. I hope that it ends there. It ought to end there. And we ought to, you know, get a census done in 2030 and a new map done in 2031.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Alright, we'll end it there. Thank you for taking the time.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Thanks, Ed, good to see you."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Cindy McCain, World Food Programme executive director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We go now to the executive director of the World Food Programme, Ambassador Cindy McCain, who joins us this morning from Rome. Ambassador, thank you so much for being with us, and you're with us in part because you're just back from a trip into Gaza. So few outsiders are getting in these days to assess the situation. What did you see?",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Well, first of all, thank you for covering this. I did go into Gaza. I entered through the Kissufim gate. Went to Deir al Balah, then on to Khan Yunis and out through the Kerem Shalom- Kerem Shalom gate. I saw a lot of devastation. I saw a lot of hunger. I saw people waiting in long lines for water. You know- what you would expect to see in a situation like that. And there's- there's clear desperation on the- on- in the hearts and minds of the people there, because there just is not enough food. I met with a family that- of 11 people that had come from the north. They'd got- walked all the way down. And what I saw, they had pictures that they brought with their- with their belongings, and I saw the kind of the before and after pictures. And there- I didn't even recognize these people. They have the weight loss, the malnutrition, the stress and everything that- the toll that it's taken on their family. It's- it's truly, truly a devastating situation, and something that we need to demand a cease fire about right now and make sure that we can get in there and feed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And yet, Israel has declared Gaza City a combat zone and is ending humanitarian pauses and ramping up air strikes around the city. Gaza, of course, is one of the areas where a global monitor has confirmed famine. You talk about the hunger you saw in and around that region. What will a more aggressive military offensive in that area mean for Gaza City?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, it's going to limit the amount of food that they have access to. Of course, the danger alone is a whole other part of that, as you know, and it does not make it easy for humanitarian aid workers to get in there as well to make sure that we can do our job. The one thing that I've been saying all along about situations like Gaza City and others is that humanitarian aid workers are not targets. They're not targets, and this has to end. So I'm hoping that perhaps it won't be as bad as we think it's going to be. But I have a feeling- I have a feeling we're going to see some- some more serious devastation.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In fact, you bring up the issue of safety for humanitarian workers. Last year, among the deadliest on record, nearly 400 killed in the line of duty. There was a World Food Program convoy that came under fire in Gaza last month. I mean, absent a ceasefire, what more needs to be done by warring parties to protect humanitarians as they try to carry out this work?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, these people are desperate. You know the- in terms of the ones that are on the ground, rushing the trucks, etc. What we need is full, unfettered access at scale, to be able to get in and feed, and feed in a way where the panic subsides. And secondly, of course, we don't do anything that involves guns or military in any way, shape, or form. And that's on purpose. That's who we are. That's our mandate. And so, obviously, a ceasefire, as I said before, being able to get in at scale, unfettered and in a safe manner, and continuously get in, and get into the furthest sites where we can't get food into- into the most vulnerable people that are- that are at risk right now.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: As part of your trip to the region, you also met with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You described it as a productive meeting, and said you discussed what you need in order to be able to get access. But, you've also said it was clear there isn't enough food getting into Gaza. And I want to read you something that the Prime Minister's Office posted on social media. They said, in part, it's regrettable that Mrs. McCain has since issued statements contradicting what she told us in Jerusalem. That is a misrepresentation. Israel is enabling a steady flow of aid in sufficient quantities. What's your response to the Prime Minister?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I stand by what I said. There's not enough food getting in. And without a full ceasefire and the ability to get in, as I said, at scale, unfettered, making sure that we're safe, doing it as well. That's the only way we're going to be able to feed people. We have, in recent weeks, been able to get a little more food in. So that's an accurate statement. But it's not enough. It simply isn't enough to be able to do the job and stop malnutrition, starvation, and all the things that have occurred as a result of it. Let me- let me add one thing to that, malnutrition and starvation and famine of any kind, it's not just about food. It's about water. It's about medicine. It's about the ability to treat the entire body of a person who is undernourished or malnourished in that way. So it involves more than just the food trucks, although that's very important, but it also involves things- special feeding for children, as well as medicine and water that need to all get in.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So let me shift you to another part of the world, because it is the World Food Program, after all, and Sudan is the other part of the world that is in the midst of famine. Earlier this month, one of your convoys was attacked while delivering it in that country as well. What challenges are you facing there, trying to get food to the people who need it in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, the incident that you just described, of course, the attacking the convoys. We're, right now we're in what we call the lean season, and so there's a lot of rain happening. It makes it even more difficult to get heavy trucks across to where the food needs to go. And of course, the conflict, El Fasher is the- is where the famine exists right now, within- within the Darfur region, but there's famine in other parts of Sudan as well. Again, it's- it's the safe access that we need to have and- and like other places, full- full unfettered access as well, and in a safe manner for our people delivering the food.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Executive Director of the World Food Programme, Ambassador Cindy McCain, thank you so much for bringing that important perspective to us this morning. We'll see you soon.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And we'll be right back."

      "Knoller was, to put it simply, a legend. For decades, everyone in the White House press corps knew him as the unofficial presidential historian and statistician.",
      "His frustration over the lack of a central database of daily presidential actions inspired him to take upon himself the enormous burden of keeping meticulous records of every presidential act, movement, and utterance, single-handedly filling an immense void in American history.",
      "As he once put it: \"I keep a daily log of everything the president does. I keep a list of speeches. I keep a list of travel \u2013 foreign travel, domestic travel. A list of outings. A list of golf. A list of pardons, vetoes, states that he's visited, states that he hasn't visited. Every time he goes on vacation, every visit to Camp David.\"",
      "\"Mark Knoller was the hardest-working and most prolific White House correspondent of a generation,\" Tom Cibrowski, president and executive editor of CBS News, said. \"Everyone in America knew his distinctive voice and his up-to-the-minute reporting across eight Presidential administrations.\"",
      "As a CBS Radio correspondent, Knoller worked extremely long hours, even without this self-imposed hardship. To keep his encyclopedic records up to date, he worked late into the evening nearly every day, departing the White House long after most of his colleagues had gone home.",
      "And what did Knoller do with this hard-earned gold mine of statistics and numbers? In the extremely competitive world of journalism, you might think he would hoard it for his own use. But no. This remarkably generous man shared it with anyone who asked \u2013 reporters on deadline, historians, even White House aides filling gaps in their own administration's records. He believed the public had a right to know.",
      "Born Feb. 20, 1952, in Brooklyn, New York, he knew from a young age that he wanted to be a reporter. After graduating from New York University, he started his career as an intern and copy boy at WNEW Radio in New York, working his way up to weekend reporter. In 1975, he became a reporter at the Associated Press Radio Network, where he remained for 13 years.",
      "In 1988, Knoller's career took an unexpected turn. While covering a trip to Helsinki and Moscow with then-Secretary of State George Schultz, he and CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky chatted about his career. She told him the CBS News Washington Bureau was looking for a new assignment editor.",
      "\"Why not take the plunge?\" she asked him. So he did.",
      "But after a few years, \"alas, he was miserable,\" Zirinsky recalls. He didn't enjoy sending other people out to cover the news. He wanted to cover the news. So CBS News offered Knoller the position of White House correspondent for CBS Radio \u2013 his dream job, and a position in which he went on to win numerous prestigious journalism awards.",
      "In his role, Knoller covered the last year of President George H.W. Bush's term, both terms of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and the first term of President Trump. He left CBS in 2020.",
      "Over the last decade of Knoller's time at CBS News, his career took another surprising turn. His voice had begun to fail, making it impossible for him to be a full-time radio correspondent. So Knoller reinvented himself. Twitter was in its early years and was quickly becoming a sensation, so Knoller jumped on the Twitter (now X) train. He began posting numerous times daily, sharing White House news, his famous facts and figures, and his entertaining witticisms with an audience that grew to 300,000 followers.",
      "Former CBS News White House correspondents who worked closely with Knoller also offered their heartfelt admiration:",
      "\"Mark Knoller was simply the best, a legendary White House journalist who was a delight to be around,\" said CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"His work was his life. He was kind, funny and always gracious in sharing his encyclopedic knowledge of the presidency. His CBS family adored him, and we will miss our friend.\"",
      "\"Mark Knoller defined what it means to chronicle and cover the White House,\" said chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. \"Mark added value where others never could \u2013 myself included. Mark was the most devoted, tenacious and clear-eyed journalist I have ever had the honor of knowing. For as long as I live, I will count among my life's greatest blessings that I was able to work alongside him.\"",
      "\"As impressive as Mark Knoller's sweep of knowledge about the White House and the presidency was \u2013 it was surpassed only by his generosity toward his many friends and colleagues\u2026And he always answered with kindness, class, and a sincere desire to help,\" said Jim Axelrod, chief correspondent and executive editor for CBS News' \"Eye on America\" franchise.",
      "Mark wasn't just a respected colleague, he was a dear friend. He helped me enormously with his knowledge of the White House, but the Mark I will always remember is the kind, witty, funny, friend with whom I spent many hours debating about one of his favorite topics: which James Bond movies, and actors, were the best and the worst.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' Margaret is off on this Labor Day weekend. I'm Ed O'Keefe. We begin today with Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, who's joining us from Florida. Madam Secretary, thanks for being with us.",
      "SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely, Ed. Thank you for inviting me.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. Well, we have a lot to discuss, so we want to start with this because we've learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning on expanding operations in the coming days to Chicago. When are those operations expected to start? And you said in recent days that you're using the recent deployments in Los Angeles as a model. What does that mean?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well, we've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws. But we do intend to add more resources to those operations. I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority, but we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do. Focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of what distinguished the Los Angeles operations, however, is that National Guard troops were there, in essence protecting or backing up those federal agents as they conducted operations. Is that what we should expect to see in Chicago?",
      "SEC. NOEM: You know that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision. I won't speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities, but I do know that LA wouldn't be standing today if President Trump hadn't taken action, then that city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state. And so the citizens who live there, the small business owners in Downtown LA, they're thankful that President Trump came in with federal law enforcement officers and helped support keeping those streets open, keep their homes and businesses from burning down, and made sure the law and order was restored.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I just want to clarify one thing you said there. You said LA wouldn't be standing if not for these federal deployments?",
      "SEC. NOEM: So many of those homes and businesses that were in Downtown LA and in those areas were dealing with riots and violence and coming in and bringing those federal law enforcement officers in was incredibly important to keeping peace, and so we are grateful that President Trump was willing to send resources and people in, in order to enforce the law. And Ed since then, we have arrested 5000 dangerous, illegal criminals out of LA and removed them from our country and had them face justice for their crimes. And many of these individuals were people who, have you know, conducted horrific- horrific activities against American citizens. Trafficking of children and pedophiles. And so that's one of the things that the people of LA can be grateful for, is that they don't have those bad actors, those people on their streets anymore because of the work of President Trump and his administration.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So as you know, we spoke with Illinois Governor, JB Pritzker about all this. And I asked him what he'd say to you about these forthcoming plans, let's play that and let you respond after.",
      "[ON TAPE]",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "ILLINOIS GOVERNOR JB PRITZKER: Well, I tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused. We have people that have lived, yes, in the state of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear? Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing. So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American, and I would tell her to maybe check herself for what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical the fact that Chicago is one of the cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations, and she was quoted as saying that Illinois quote 'refuses to have our back.'",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here. People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know- freedom to express, and we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the nobody has their backs. What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort, that is to say, they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city, and by the way, we're succeeding at that job. But when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "[END TAPE]",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Madam Secretary, your response?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well, for 13 consecutive years, Chicago had more murders than any other American city. In fact, just last year, in 2024, they had three times the amount of murders that LA did, five times more than New York City. So he can talk about what a great job he's doing as Governor, but he's failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt, and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that's happening in Chicago. So I was a governor for many years. So I recognize the responsibilities that you have on your shoulder when you're a governor. And I'll tell you, as a governor, when I had to make tough decisions, and when I had disagreements with the Biden administration or challenges my people were facing, I called up the Biden administration. I went and talked to them. I asked for meetings. I fought for my people. This seems like it's more about Governor Pritzker's ego, now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he has one murder in the city of Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, what's your ideas? What can we do? They don't even honor our detainers in Chicago. They don't go out there and work with us to make sure we're bringing people to justice. And instead, he goes on TV and he attacks me when we're doing exactly what those people need, is they need someone to help them get the dangerous criminals off their streets. And if he has 1, 2, 5, or 10, those victims and their families deserve to walk in freedom on those streets and not have to worry about what's going to happen to them on their way to their jobs.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, you anticipated some of the questions we asked of him. So, as we say in this business, stay tuned for that. But we'll- let's ask you a few more while we have you. Are you planning, beyond Chicago, to expand these kinds of operations to other cities? There have been reports, for example, that Boston may very well soon be next.",
      "SEC. NOEM: I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in. We've been working to partner with every single agency that we can. We have hundreds and hundreds of agreements with local law enforcement, sheriffs, city administrators and mayors across the country that want to solve problems. I'd encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, DC are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us. Because we will work with anybody and do what we can to make sure that we're upholding our Constitution, upholding the law, but making sure their families are safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You mentioned, there, a bunch of cities in Democratic-controlled states with Democratic mayors, and there have been a lot of questions asked about that focus. There are Republican cities with major crime issues as well, and we haven't heard about plans to deploy, say, to Dallas or to Oklahoma City, or to cities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that have considerable crime rates, in some cases higher, percentage-wise, than those other cities you mentioned. Are there plans to go to red states and Republican-controlled cities in this kind of way?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Absolutely. Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we've got operations that, again, I won't talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens. It is what can we do to make sure that we're continuing to get up every day and to fight for the American citizen, and that they have the chance to go out there and pursue the American dream.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u00a0All right. So, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is aiming to hire another 10,000 officers by the end of this year, nearly double the size of the current force. Basic training is being reduced from 13 weeks to 8 weeks in an attempt to accelerate the hiring and the onboarding of these officers. Their signing bonuses, some age caps have been lifted. Did the hiring standards get lowered in part to meet this daily quota of 3,000 arrests?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well what we've done as far as recruitment- and, again, Ed, we've got over 130,000 people that have applied to be a part of that 10,000 new hires within ICE, but we did not reduce any of the qualifications or time frames. What we did was that we made sure that we were being much more efficient in getting these officers out on the street and giving them more opportunity to get trained quickly and recognize the previous training that they had. If they were a previous law enforcement officer or someone that wanted to come back out of retirement, we facilitated that, where before, the federal government had ignored those individuals or put them through classes that they had already qualified for or become masters at. So, I think that streamlining is what needed to happen, and we're so grateful that so many other retired law enforcement officers or those from different areas of the country say, listen, I want to be a part of what ICE is doing, because these individuals are out there making sure that they're going after dangerous criminals and bringing them to justice, and making sure that if they're here in this country, and they've perpetuated these crimes and violence, that they have the opportunity to go home to their own home country and face consequences there as well.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u00a0One of the most high profile examples of someone who's been rounded up by ICE in recent months is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and the fate of his situation is still up in the air. He's awaiting trial on human smuggling charges set for January in Tennessee, but your department is also working to get him deported to Uganda. If he broke the law in this country, as the administration alleges, shouldn't he be held here and face charges here instead of being deported?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well, prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and in Pam Bondi's department, so we will let them do that. Although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him civilly as well, and the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn't walk free in the United States of America. This individual was a known human smuggler, MS-13 gang member, an individual who was a wife beater and someone who was so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors and even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off. He was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children, so he needs to never be in the United States of America, and our administration is making sure we're doing all that we can to bring him to justice.*",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But I heard you say that we're going to let the Justice Department do that. Does this mean that- does this mean that- does that mean the push to deport him to Uganda is off?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Oh, we will still continue to pursue all options. We will make sure that he's not released into this country. So regardless of that, yes, absolutely, he's not an American citizen, and he shouldn't be here, and especially because of his dangerous criminal activities, we should ensure that we leave every avenue on the table.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Got it. So, among other things, you oversee FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As we hit the peak of hurricane season, and we're marking the 20th anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina this weekend, 20 years ago. Is the federal government prepared to respond to a major disaster at this moment?",
      "SEC. NOEM: We are absolutely more prepared than the last administration and doing a much better job responding to the disasters we've already experienced since President Trump has been in the White House. We've had over a dozen, close to 20 different disasters throughout the country just since President Trump has been the president of the United States. And we have deployed resources twice as fast as FEMA ever has in the past, gotten people on the ground over 100% quicker than any other administration has. In fact, with the disasters that we saw that were so horrific and devastating in Texas and New Mexico, North Carolina, we've had people on the ground within hours responding to those families that were in crisis. So FEMA is consistently doing a much better job than it has in the past, and we're going to continue to stay on guard and make sure that we're there to always support these local states and these local emergency management directors in them being- getting the chance to run their disaster operations.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I bring this up because part of what you're suggesting there is in dispute from a handful of current and former FEMA employees who wrote to Congress this past week raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to forthcoming natural disasters. One of the specific concerns they have is this decision that now has you reviewing any cost of $100,000 or more that FEMA plans to make. Can you give me an example of a charge of $100,000 or more that you've rejected?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Yeah, absolutely. We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, to a one-woman firm to deliver to us 30 million meals, and she delivered only 50,000 to us. And it was a- one person that the st- federal government had contracted with in order to deliver 30 million, and I don't know how they ever expected one person to do that. We, we had a person that was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to book meetings that of less than 10 to 15 people, and with no meetings that we saw that were productive or couldn't be done by sending an email. Over and over again we're looking at these contracts and looking at the fact that, are they duplicative? Are they just supporting woke ideologies, DEI? Or are they actually delivering disaster response, which is what FEMA job is, is to put in place operations, to support states and local governments to take care of people. And so that evaluation has saved us hundreds of millions of dollars within FEMA and within the Department of Homeland Security, it has saved us $13 billion already. And we're going to consider- continue to make sure that we're accountable to taxpayers. You know, in Washington D.C., I rarely run into anybody who says I'm a lobbyist for the American taxpayer. Well, guess what, Kristi Noem is. Every day I get up and I think, the American people are paying for this, should they? And are these dollars doing what the law says they should be doing? I'm going to make sure that they go there and they're spent on what's appropriate according to the law, and that the taxpayers understand that it's a worthwhile effort.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: At least 20 of the people who signed this letter were current FEMA employees, and they've been placed on administrative leave. And I'd heard you in previous interviews suggest that those that are making accusations against the agency should put their names on the criticisms of the allegations. So now they have, and they've been placed on administrative leave. And I'm curious if it's now the policy of DHS that any time an employee puts their name on something publicly criticizes you or the President's leadership, that they should anticipate being put on leave or fired.",
      "SEC. NOEM: This- this letter was signed by many people anonymously. There was some who had their names on there. And those who had their names on there were temporary contract employees who had worked for the Department of Homeland Security for less than a year, individuals who are not long-term FEMA employees, who- who grab a hold of the mission to be there, to go and serve individuals and to- are deployed across the country, and have for years to make sure they're responsive to families in their time of need. So absolutely, every employee will be evaluated as to if they're doing their job and if they're doing it appropriately. And my hope is that every single person within the Department of Homeland Security, but also in this government, gets up every day wanting to make America safer, wanting to do their job and to contribute to that in a very productive way.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining us this Sunday from Florida. Thank you so much. Lots to discuss. We appreciate it.",
      "SEC. NOEM: Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.",
      "*Editor's note: Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been charged with two counts of human smuggling and has pleaded not guilty. He is currently in ICE detention pending trial. He has not been charged with any counts related to child abuse."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and KFF editor-at-large for public health, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're joined now by Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News Medical Contributor and the Editor at Large for Public Health at KFF Health News. Doctor, so great to see you. Thanks for coming to Washington for this important conversation. Because it's been a pretty chaotic week at the CDC, to say the least. We've seen the ouster of the head of the agency, who'd only been confirmed by the Senate this summer, she's now mounting a legal challenge to that. Other top officials also departed. They're still reeling from a shooting at the headquarters in Atlanta a few weeks ago. Why are these departures so important to take note of? And how do they affect you, me, and everybody else, in terms of health and medicine?DR. C\u00c9LINE GOUNDER: I think it's really important to understand that this is not just palace intrigue. This really does affect all of us. So not just the director, but the people in charge of respiratory infections, vaccine safety, the Chief Medical Officer, the person who was in charge of public health data also resigned earlier this week. So these are really key positions. Not to mention that a lot of the directors of the different centers, because it's centers plural, have also been forced out over the last several months. So you're really dealing with a leadership vacuum at the CDC. So, this is not business as usual. And so, specifically, how does this affect you and me, folks watching at home? So, first of all, vaccine policy. Vaccine policy is now being made by political fiat and communicated through social media, rather than a transparent, open, scientific review process. And so, we're seeing the reversal of previous recommendations, which will also confuse whether insurance will cover certain vaccines for certain people, and it's already sowing tremendous confusion at pharmacies, as well as doctor's offices.ED O'KEEFE: So, there is a series of meetings coming up regarding the future of vaccines and how they're going to be available, who gets them. Tell us about that and the concerns that some of these, now-former CDC officials had about what might happen at those meetings?DR. GOUNDER: Yeah. So these meetings are scheduled for mid-September. Some of the things on the agenda include the newborn Hepatitis B dose. We typically give it to newborns because that's to prevent transmission from the mother to the baby. So, that's one of the most common ways Hepatitis B is transmitted.ED O'KEEFE: One of the first shots a baby gets.DR. GOUNDER: One of the first shots it gets, for good reason. Also protection for infants, for RSV, one of the most common causes of hospitalization among infants. Number three, the COVID shots. And we expect to see a tightening of availability, eligibility of COVID shots, especially for healthy kids and adults. And then, finally, the combined measles, mumps, rubella varicella vaccine, and revisiting long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations would really be unprecedented, here.ED O'KEEFE: So, it's basically every shot you get from like 0 to 18 is now up for debate, and then the COVID shot, of course, which is an important one for many people on a regular, rolling basis?DR. GOUNDER:Yeah, some really basic things that we have counted on for a very long time. Some of the core concerns with the process involve cherry-picking of data, scientific reviews being altered or pulled, and unvetted studies being rushed into the process, into policy-making. And this is really an inversion of radical transparency.ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. There was a- there's an example in recent days, because there- is we're starting- fall is coming, COVID picks up. We've already seen one example of a school in Kansas City that was forced to shut down temporarily due to COVID, and there have been spikes in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, especially. What do people at home need to know as the fall approaches and COVID starts to spike?DR. GOUNDER: Well, I think, first of all, vaccinations are for many different purposes. So it's to prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. But, for a lot of people, you may not be able to call in sick from work very easily, like for us, it's really hard to take time off even if you really are sick. You might want to keep your kids in school, and so the best way to keep yourself at work or your kids in school is for them to get vaccinated so you and they are not getting sick.ED O'KEEFE: Let's- and we should point out, by the way, that school closed, set to open again on Tuesday, but the fact that they had to close at all, right, as the school year is beginning, is a sign, potentially, of things to come when people don't get their shots. Let's bottom line this. I'm a 42-year-old guy with asthma. Am I going to have issues getting my COVID shot?DR. GOUNDER: You will not, because- even though you're under 65. So the recommendations- or the FDA approval is for people 65 and older, they are all good. They can get their Covid shot. Under 65 if you have at least one risk factor for severe Covid, you can also get your Covid shot. So you can, absolutely. That's not an issue for you, Ed.ED O'KEEFE: But it's- you know, kids under 18, a perfectly healthy spouse, aging parents?--DR. GOUNDER: -- Yes, so aging parents over 65 they're eligible. But say you're between 6 months and 64 years of age and you do not have a risk factor for severe COVID. That is the group where we really have a lot of uncertainty. Now, I should point out, pregnancy is a risk factor for severe COVID. So your healthy wife, let's say she were pregnant, which I don't think she is, but if she were, she would be eligible for a COVID shot.ED O'KEEFE: All right. Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, we love having you to help us understand all this. We appreciate you coming down, good to see you. And we will be right back."

      "ED O'KEEFE: I'm Ed O'Keefe in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: With President Trump looking to expand immigration and crime crackdowns in more U.S. cities, we will hear exclusively from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Boosted by a drop in crime in the nation's capital following the deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to clean up D.C., the president sets his sights on another potential target, Chicago.",
      "We visited the Windy City and toured a neighborhood where the crime rate has dropped with the governor of Illinois, Democrat J.B. Pritzker.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): What they're saying they're trying to do is fight crime, but, actually, they're just trying to scare people.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Pritzker tells us Trump and Secretary Noem's mission is un- American.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops if they in fact do that.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Plus: the shakeup at the Centers for Disease Control. After the firing of the newly confirmed director, a group of top experts quit in protest. CBS medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder will tell us why this matters to public health.",
      "Then, World Food Programme executive director Cindy McCain joins us following a trip to Gaza, where her organization is working to feed hundreds of thousands threatened by famine.",
      "Finally, we will reflect on the passing of a Washington institution, legendary CBS News radio reporter Mark Knoller.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off on this Labor Day weekend. I'm Ed O'Keefe.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, who's joining us from Florida.",
      "Madam Secretary, thanks for being with us.",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Absolutely, Ed. Thank you for inviting me.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. Well, we have a lot to discuss.",
      "And we want to start with this, because we've learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning on expanding operations in the coming days to Chicago. When are those operations expected to start? And you said in recent days that you're using the recent deployments in Los Angeles as a model. What does that mean?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, we've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws.",
      "But we do intend to add more resources to those operations. I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority.",
      "But we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do, focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of what distinguished the Los Angeles operations, however, is that National Guard troops were there, in essence, protecting or backing up those federal agents as they conducted operations.",
      "Is that what we should expect to see in Chicago?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision. I won't speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities, but I do know that L.A. wouldn't be standing today if President Trump hadn't taken action.",
      "And that city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state. And so the citizens who live there, the small business owners in downtown L.A., they're thankful that President Trump came in with federal law enforcement officers and helped support keeping those streets open, keep their homes and businesses from burning down, and made sure the law and order was restored.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I just want to clarify one thing you said there. You said L.A. wouldn't be standing if not for these federal deployments?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: So many of those homes and businesses that were in downtown L.A. and in those areas were dealing with riots and violence. And coming in and bringing those federal law enforcement officers in was incredibly important to keeping peace.",
      "And so we are grateful that President Trump was willing to send resources and people in, in order to enforce the law. And, Ed, since then, we have arrested 5,000 dangerous illegal criminals out of L.A. and removed them from our country and had them face justice for their crimes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, as you know, we spoke with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker about all this. And I asked him what he'd say to you about these forthcoming plans. Let's play that and let you respond after.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): Well, I tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused.",
      "We have people that have lived, yes, in the state of Illinois, in the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law-abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors. And why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?",
      "Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing.",
      "So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American. And I would tell her to maybe check herself for, what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical the fact that Chicago is one of the cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations, and she was quoted as saying that Illinois \u2013 quote \u2013 \"refuses to have our back.\"",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here.",
      "People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know, freedom to express. And we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the nobody has their backs.",
      "What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort. That is to say, they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city. And, by the way, we're succeeding at that job. But when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Madam Secretary, your response?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, for 13 consecutive years, Chicago had more murders than any other American city. In fact, just last year, in 2024, they had three times the amount of murders that L.A. did, five times more than New York City.",
      "So he can talk about what a great job he's doing as governor, but he's failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt, and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that's happening in Chicago.",
      "So I was a governor for many years. So I recognize the responsibilities that you have on your shoulder when you're a governor. And I will tell you, as a governor, when I had to make tough decisions, and when I had disagreements with the Biden administration or challenges my people were facing, I called up the Biden administration.",
      "I went and talked to them. I asked for meetings. I fought for my people. This seems like it's more about Governor Pritzker's ego now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he has one murder in the city of Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, what's your ideas? What can we do?",
      "They don't even honor our detainers in Chicago. They don't go out there and work with us to make sure we're bringing people to justice. And, instead, he goes on TV and he attacks me, when we're doing exactly what those people need, is, they need someone to help them get the dangerous criminals off their streets.",
      "And if he has one, two, five or 10, those victims and their families deserve to walk in freedom on those streets and not have to worry about what's going to happen to them on their way to their jobs.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "Are you planning, beyond Chicago, to expand these kinds of operations to other cities? There have been reports, for example, that Boston may very well soon be next.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now.",
      "And so we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in. We've been working to partner with every single agency that we can. We have hundreds and hundreds of agreements with local law enforcement, sheriffs, city administrators that \u2013 and mayors across the country that want to solve problems.",
      "I would encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C. are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You mentioned there are a bunch of cities in Democratic- controlled states with Democratic mayors. And there have been a lot of questions asked about that focus.",
      "There are Republican cities with major crime issues as well, and we haven't heard about plans to deploy, say, to Dallas or to Oklahoma City, or to cities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that have considerable crime rates, in some cases higher, percentage-wise, than those other cities you mentioned.",
      "Are there plans to go to red states and Republican-controlled cities in this kind of way?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we've got operations that, again, I won't talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the most-high profile examples of someone who's been rounded up by ICE in recent months is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and the fate of his situation is still up in the air.",
      "He's awaiting trial on human smuggling charges set for January in Tennessee, but your department is also working to get him deported to Uganda. If he broke the law in this country, as the administration alleges, shouldn't he be held here and face charges here, instead of being deported?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and \u2013 and Pam Bondi's department. So we will let them do that.",
      "Although this individual does have criminal charges pending, he has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn't walk free in the United States of America.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But I heard you say that we're going to let the Justice Department do that. Does this mean that \u2013 does that mean the push to deport him to Uganda is off?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Oh, we will still continue to pursue all options.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We will make sure that he's not released into this country. So, regardless of that, yes, absolutely.",
      "He's not an American citizen, and he shouldn't be here. And especially because of his dangerous criminal activities, we should ensure that we leave every avenue on the table.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Got it.",
      "So, among other things, you oversee FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as we hit the peak of hurricane season. And we're marking the 20th anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina this weekend 20 years ago. Is the federal government prepared to respond to a major disaster at this moment?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are absolutely more prepared than the last administration and doing a much better job responding to the disasters we've already experienced since President Trump has been in the White House.",
      "We've had over a dozen, close to 20 different disasters throughout the country just since President Trump has been the president of the United States. And we have deployed resources twice as fast as FEMA ever has in the past, gotten people on the ground over 100 percent quicker than any other administration has.",
      "In fact, with the disasters that we saw that were so horrific and devastating in Texas and New Mexico, North Carolina, we've had people on the ground within hours responding to those families that were in crisis.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "I bring this up because part of what you're suggesting there is in dispute from a handful of current and former FEMA employees who wrote to Congress this past week raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to forthcoming natural disasters.",
      "One of the specific concerns they have is this decision that now has you reviewing any cost of $100,000 or more that FEMA plans to make. Can you give me an example of a charge of $100,000 or more that you've rejected?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, absolutely.",
      "We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars to a one- woman firm to deliver to us 30 million meals, and she delivered only 50,000 to us. And it was a \u2013 one person that the state \u2013 federal government had contracted with in order to deliver 30 million. And I don't know how they ever expected one person to do that.",
      "We \u2013 we had a person that was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to book meetings\u2026",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that \u2013 of less than 10 to 15 people, and with no meetings that we saw that were productive or couldn't be done by sending an e-mail.",
      "Over and over again, we're looking at these contracts and looking at the fact that, are they duplicative, are they just supporting woke ideologies, DEI, or are they actually delivering disaster response, which is what FEMA job is, is to put in place operations to support states and local governments to take care of people.",
      "And so that evaluation has saved us hundreds of millions of dollars within FEMA. And within the Department of Homeland Security, it has saved us $13 billion already. And we're going to consider \u2013 continue to make sure that we're accountable to taxpayers.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: At least 20 of the people who signed this letter were current FEMA employees, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I had heard you in previous interviews suggest that those that are making accusations against the agency should put their names on the criticisms of the allegations. So, now they have, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I'm curious if it's now the policy of DHS that any time an employee puts their name on something, publicly criticizes you or the president's leadership, that they should anticipate being put on leave or fired.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: This \u2013 this letter was signed by many people anonymously. There was some who had their names on there.",
      "And those who had their names on there were temporary contract employees who had worked for the Department of Homeland Security for less than a year, individuals who are not long-term FEMA employees, who \u2013 who grab ahold of the mission to be there, to go and serve individuals and to \u2013 are deployed across the country, and have for years to make sure they're responsive to families in their time of need.",
      "So, absolutely, every employee will be evaluated as to if they're doing their job and if they're doing it appropriately.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining us this Sunday from Florida, thank you so much. Lots to discuss. We appreciate it.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Face the Nation is back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: On Friday, we traveled to Chicago and sat down with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. He invited us there in advance of the expanded federal presence Secretary Noem was just talking about.",
      "Here's what he told us.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): We hope that they don't send any troops along with ICE. And, if they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do \u2013 you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If they're doing federal immigration work, a judge might say, if they're protecting those federal agents, that's OK. I mean, you'll just fight that in court as long as you can?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, National Guard troops, any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don't belong, unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Have you been briefed by anyone in the administration about these plans?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: No one in the administration, the president, or anybody under him, has called anyone in my administration or \u2013 and me \u2013 have not called the city of Chicago or anyone else.",
      "So it's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that. The other thing is, you know, they ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they're coming, where they're coming, if it's ICE or if it's ATF or whoever it is.",
      "But they don't want to do that either. And I must say, it's disruptive. It's dangerous. It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are and when we can't coordinate with them.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The president has had some things to say about the Windy City several times in recent days.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Next should be Chicago, because, as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now.",
      "Everybody knows Chicago is a hellhole right now. Everybody knows it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: You know, he wakes up in the morning and whatever whim strikes him is what he apparently says.",
      "And recently, I guess I have been living rent-free in his head. Chicago apparently is living rent-free in his head, even though, on other days he'll talk about Baltimore, he'll talk about New York. Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states.",
      "Illinois is not even in the bottom half of states in terms of violent crime. But do you hear him talking about Florida, where he is now from? No, you don't hear him talking about that, or Texas. Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places. And we're very proud of the work that we've done. And we want more help.",
      "You know what kind of help we want? Civilian law enforcement help. We would like ATF agents to help us take more guns off the streets. We would like FBI, again, to coordinate with our local law enforcement to help catch perpetrators of crimes. If they would do that, we would welcome that.",
      "But that's not what they're planning to do.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, bottom line, would more federal agents in Chicago, assisting local law enforcement help deter crime right now?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Of course. You want to help us catch bad guys? Help \u2013 bring the FBI. Bring the ATF. We already coordinate with them, by the way. We do a lot of work with them.",
      "We do some \u2013 we do drug interdiction, we do fighting gangs, and we do, you know, interdiction of guns at the borders.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of the reason I ask about the potential for federal deployments to help right now is that, according to a CBS News data analysis of what's gone on in Washington just in the last few weeks, well, crime there as well was down, and in most cases down double digits.",
      "It's down nearly 50 percent in the three weeks since the National Guard moved in, assaults down 41 percent, homicides down 69 percent, robbery down 63 percent, and the mayor concedes carjacking, which had become a bigger problem, down 83 percent since the federal agents showed up.",
      "So this kind of deployment he's set up in Washington that he says he wants to do in other cities, at least in Washington, is showing potential success. And what I hear you saying is, well, sure, if they show up, it might help us too?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's un-American. And, frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But if he just sends the FBI, the ATF, DEA\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: They're \u2013 yes, they're here already.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u2026 and sends more of them?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: We have some working with us now. Would love more help.",
      "You know what else he's doing? He's cutting funds that help us to fight violent crime from the federal government.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Give me an example of how those cuts have affected the ability to fight crime in Chicago.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: So, let me just tell you what happened in Illinois when we had a Republican governor and he cut funding for programs that helped prevent crime.",
      "What happened was we, saw a significant increase in crime. Donald Trump is now doing the same thing. He's taking away federal funding for those programs which are so important to us. We've increased funding at the state level, but we need that federal funding. It's on top of that.",
      "One more thing. The business community in the city of Chicago got together and put $100 million forward to help us, back in 2022, to help us to fight crime through these prevention programs. It's working. Crime is down.",
      "I mean, murders are down 50 percent in the city of Chicago. And you can go through every statistic. Almost everything is much better as a result of that work. Donald Trump is trying to take that money away. And he isn't listening to the business community here. He isn't listening to the clergy here. He isn't listening to people on the ground, Republicans here who understand that putting troops on the city of Chicago's streets is going to cause more problems than he understands.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What do you think it's going to do to the country if that happens? Deploying in Washington, where he has federal control, is one thing, but if he sends military forces into a major American city in a state that didn't ask for it, beyond Los Angeles, what do Americans make of that?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, they should understand that he has other aims other than fighting crime. That's the first thing they should understand.",
      "The second is, it's an attack on the American people by the president of the United States. Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him, but should he be sending troops in? No.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said he has other aims. What are the other aims?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: The other aims are that he'd like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.",
      "He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control, if, in fact, he's allowed to do this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I hear you talking about invasion. I hear you \u2013 him about \u2013 I hear you talking about him suspending elections. Is it your belief he's an authoritarian?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Look, I can tell you this.",
      "I built a Holocaust museum. I know what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned after an election in 53 days. And I'm very, very concerned. We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know.",
      "And I can tell you that \u2013 that the playbook is the same. It's thwart the media. It's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happened throughout history. And Donald Trump is just following that playbook.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Is there any chance Illinois redraws its congressional lines before next year's midterm elections?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's not something that I want to do. It's not something that any of us want to do.",
      "But I have to say, if Donald Trump is going to force his will on the American people by going to his MAGA allies in various states and have them \u2013 having them redraw in the middle of a decade, when you're supposed to be doing it right after a census, with a year ending in 1, not a year ending in 5, if he's going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What much \u2013 what much more could you do, though, as an Illinois Democrat? I mean, your map already gets an F from most good government groups for being gerrymandered. Would you wipe out all the Republican districts?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Yes, it is possible to have more Democratic districts in the state of Illinois, and we \u2013 we could do it. Like I said, it's not something that I want to do.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're joined now by Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and the editor at large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Doctor, so great to see you. Thanks for coming to Washington for this important conversation because it's been a pretty chaotic week at the CDC, to say the least. We've seen the ouster of the head of the agency, who'd only been confirmed by the Senate this summer. She's now mounting a legal challenge to that. Other top officials also departed. They're still reeling from a shooting at the headquarters in Atlanta a few weeks ago.",
      "What are these departures so important to take note of, and how do they affect you, me and everybody else in terms of health and \u2013 and medicine?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: I think it's really important to understand that this is not just palace intrigue. This really does affect all of us. So, not just the director, but the people in charge of respiratory infections, vaccine safety, the chief medical officer, the person who is in charge of public health data also resigned earlier this week. So, these are really key positions, not to mention that a lot of the directors of the different centers, because it's centers, plural, have also been forced out over the last several months. So, you're really dealing with a leadership vacuum at the CDC. So, this is not business as usual.",
      "And so, specifically, how does this affect you and me, folks watching at home? So, first of all, vaccine policy. Vaccine policy is now being made by political fiat and communicated through social media, rather than a transparent, open, scientific review process. And so, we're seeing the reversal of previous recommendations, which will also confuse whether insurance will cover certain vaccines for certain people. And it's already sowing tremendous confusion at pharmacies, as well as doctors' offices.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, there is a series of meetings coming up regarding the future of vaccines, and how they're going to be available, who gets them. Tell us about that and \u2013 and the concerns that some of these now former CDC officials had about what might happen at those meetings.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so what \u2013 these meetings are scheduled for mid- September. Some of the things on the agenda include the newborn Hepatitis B dose. We typically give it to newborns because that's to prevent transmission from the mother to the baby, so it's one of the most common ways that Hepatitis B is transmitted.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the first shots a baby gets.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: One of the first shots it gets, for good reason. Also protection for infants from RSV, one of the most common causes of hospitalization among infants. Number three, the Covid shot. And we expect to see a tightening of availability, eligibility of Covid shots, especially for healthy kids and adults.",
      "And then finally, the combined measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and revisiting long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations would really be unprecedented here.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, it's basically every shot you get, from like zero to 18, is now up for debate. And then the Covid shot, of course, which is an important one for many people, on a regular rolling basis?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, some really basic things that we have counted on for a very long time. Some of the core concerns with the process involves cherry picking of data, scientific reviews being altered or pulled, and unvetted studies being rushed into the process, into policymaking. And this is really an inversion of radical transparency.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. There was a \u2013 there's an example in recent days because there is \u2013 we're starting \u2013 you know, fall's coming, Covid picks up. We've already seen one example of a school in Kansas City that was forced to shut down temporarily due to Covid. And there have been spikes in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, especially. What do people at home need to know as the fall approaches and Covid starts to spike?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Well, I think, first of all, vaccinations are for many different purposes. So, it's to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death. But for a lot of people, you may not be able to call in sick from work very easily. Like for us, it's really hard to take time off, even if you really are sick. You might want to keep your kids in school. And so the best way to keep yourself at work or your kids in school is for them to get vaccinated so you and they are not getting sick.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Let's \u2013 and we should point out, by the way, that school closed. Set to open again on Tuesday. But the fact that they had to close at all, right, as the school year's begins, is a sign potentially of things to come if people don't get their shots.",
      "Let's bottom line this. I'm a 42-year-old guy with asthma. Am I going to have issues getting my Covid shot?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: You will not because even though you're under 65 \u2013 so, the recommendations or the FDA approval is for people 65 and older, they are all good. They can get their Covid shot.",
      "Under 65, if you have at least one risk factor for severe Covid, you can also get your Covid shot. So, you can absolutely \u2013 that's not an issue for you, Ed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But it's, you know, kids under 18, they're perfectly healthy, spouse, aging parents, it's up in the air.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so aging parents over 65, they \u2013 they're eligible. But say you're between six months and 64 years of age, and you do not have a risk factor for severe Covid, that is the group where we really have a lot of uncertainty. Now, I should point out, pregnancy is a risk factor for severe Covid. So, your healthy wife, let's say she were pregnant, which I don't think she is.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Nope.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: But if she were, she would be eligible for a Covid shot.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right. Dr. Celine Gounder, we love having you to help us understand all this. We appreciate you coming down. Good to see you.",
      "And we will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We are joined now by a panel of political journalists who \u2013 who know what they're talking about. Let's put it that way. CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs, \"Politico's\" Capitol bureau chief Rachael Bade, and \"Washington Post\" newly minted chief political correspondent Karen Tumulty.",
      "Great to see all of you.",
      "We were just talking to Dr. Gounder about the ouster of the CDC director. We've seen the ouster of a handful of other officials at the Federal Reserve.",
      "Jennifer, I understand you have some new information on where the president may be seeking to oust people next.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Well, it's not like they're going agency to agency and picking an agency that they're trying to clean out. It's a little more random than that.",
      "But I can tell you that they're really serious about trying to weed out people who they think are working at \u2013 at cross purposes to their agenda. I asked around if there are more firings coming, and I was told, yes, definitively.",
      "And I'll tell you a quick anecdote and that kind of illustrate this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: So, there was a surprise birthday party a few days ago for one of the president's top advisers, Stephen Miller. And he was entertaining this crowd, which included a bunch of cabinet secretaries and House Speaker Mike Johnson and other VIPs. And he was explaining about how, back in the day, when he and Mike Johnson were just, you know, essentially nobodies, he would run his ideas by Mike Johnson and he \u2013 even though Stephen thought they were crazy even himself, Mike Johnson said that they were good ideas. And Stephen said, some of the stuff we're trying now is untested.",
      "But it just really illustrated how this president and his closest advisors are willing to do whatever it takes to try to push out people that they think are at cross purposes to their agenda, and that includes people at these quasi-independent agencies, whether it's the bureaucracy that they inherited or whether it's people that the president personally interviewed and selected, like the CDC director.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE (Capitol Bureau Chief And Senior Washington Correspondent, \"Politico\": You know, when Donald Trump talked on the campaign trail about draining the swamp, I mean he's been talking about this for 10 years, I don't think a lot of people, you know, thought he was talking about health officials, about scientist, about people who work in national security. But, obviously, he is taking it, his sort of, you know, mantra to that point right now.",
      "And I mean we have to \u2013 we have to acknowledge that a lot of people have said, Donald Trump doesn't have this authority when it came to DOGE and getting rid of a lot of federal workers, folks said, look, they have a lot of protections. You can't do that.",
      "Well, the courts, a lot of them, have sided with him. And so, he's taking it to the next step here. And, you know, there's a lot of questions about whether he can do it. But obviously, he's going to try. And he's succeeded a lot in the courts, where a lot of people thought he would not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But with Congress coming back, what are they going to do about it?",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Well \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Nothing.",
      "BADE: Yes. Good \u2013 pretty \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Basically nothing. And this is not only \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not only a war on expertise, but the \u2013 in the early phases it was all about going after the so-called deep state government employees, the bureaucracy. Now they've begun to oust their own people, their own appointees.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And as you write today, most of the conservative movement kind of hangs back, stays quiet about it, and lets it happen.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Exactly.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Not just stays quiet about it, they're encouraging it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: I mean, look at Laura Loomer and what she has \u2013 has been doing in terms of pushing for firings. And she's been very successful.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You heard Secretary Noem talk about crime. You saw Illinois Governor Pritzker's response to that, Rachael.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Uh-huh.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Republicans, obviously, see this as a winning issue for them. How is Congress going to pick this up? Because a lot of this has transpired since their summer break began.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: They're going to get asked all sorts of questions this week as they come back about whether there's something they need to do to step in.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Look, I think you're going to see Republicans lean into it. I mean, obviously, this is an initiative that Donald Trump himself has been pushing. I don't think if you ask lawmakers, specifically Republican lawmakers in July if they were going to be focused on a big crime bill in September, I don't think anyone would have told you that that would be the case.",
      "But Donald Trump has been very successful in terms of changing the narrative. I mean when you think about lawmakers leaving town at the end of July, everyone was focused on Epstein and how the president couldn't shake the narrative. Now they're coming back and the full focus of Washington is on crime. And this is an issue, as I have written in my column, that very much benefits Republicans. I mean there are polls that show a lot of the nation doesn't like what he's doing with the National Guard.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: But when it comes to people's approval rating of Trump and crime, he's at something like 54 percent according to a recent AP poll.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. So, he's found a new \u2013 a new issue to help boost him.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, of course.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The word he used this week was \"trap.\" That Democrats are walking into a trap. And, in fact, crime is an issue that has always been problematic for Democrats \u2013",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Because they are sort of caught between not wanting to look soft on public safety, but also protecting civil rights, which are one of their core values.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is what I thought made the governor's answer interesting, where he said, yes, you're right, I'm not helping the federal government with immigration because we're worried about crime and public safety at the state and local level, and they'll do the immigration. And his ability to split those two, I felt, was a little cleaner than many other Democratic governors and mayors have been when they realize they're dealing with this hot potato.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The other thing that struck me in that, too, was him saying, we would welcome some federal help.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Send more.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The FBI have been helping us catch bad guys.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: And I think that I was also, when I was doing reporting this week, it turns out a lot of police chiefs across the country are watching this with great curiosity because they want to see, you know, what's working here and what's not in D.C.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, I thought his \u2013 his response about bringing in ATF \u2013 ATF officials and FBI officials helping with crime there, that showed me that Democrats are starting to maybe read the political tea leaves here and come up with smarter answers, because when Trump first started talking about this, the response was, we don't need the National Guard. Crime is down. Look at the stats. But the reality is, people don't feel it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Eighty percent of Americans think crime is just as bad as it was recently, or getting worse. Only 20 percent think it's actually getting better.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: On the politics of it, Trump people don't just want to win issues, they want to systematically work their opposition into a corner and crack their coalition. And if you were to design an issue that could start to nibble away at the Democratic stranglehold on \u2013 on large metropolitan cities in the United States, this is it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. You are \u2013 I like to call you \"scoop,\" at least around these parts. And you had another big one this week regarding the future of Iowa's Republican Senator Joni Ernst. She's announcing, in the coming days, that she's not running for re-election. It had been talked about, thought it might happen. She had also made a two-term vow, and so we're nearing that. Why'd she do it? And is it indicative of a problem for the party in Iowa or for congressional Republicans writ large that someone like her would walk away?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I think we're going to have to wait from her on \u2013 on why she did it. It will be very interesting when she makes her \u2013 her statement this week if it does indeed come.",
      "But Iowa, Ed, is really turning into a hot, hot battleground. You have not had an open U.S. Senate race and an open gubernatorial race at the same time, with no incumbents, in nearly 60 years. So, my sources say that Iowa native Matt Whitaker is talking with President Trump about a potential run for U.S. Senate in 2026. He has told people he's going to decide by the end of this year. He's currently the U.S. ambassador to NATO.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: And he's been in the news lately for that Ukraine-NATO arms initiative.",
      "You've also got Republican Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, who Iowa Republicans tell me are \u2013 they're fully expecting her to jump into the race in the next few days. And activist, Republicans in Iowa, really like her. They say she's very personable. She's obviously good on \u2013 in front of a camera.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: She came from the world of TV.",
      "Then you've got, on the Democratic side, this guy named Josh Turek, who is a Paralympic gold medalist. The Democrats are pinning a lot of their hopes on him.",
      "So, you could potentially have an open congressional race. Two other congressional races that are really tight, the open Senate race, the open gubernatorial race. Iowa's going to be a hot battleground.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is exactly what the Democrats want, because you've now forced the Republicans to spend money in a state they thought they had.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: When they're also recruiting big names in other states. So, this is a problem for them.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, it's a \u2013 it's definitely a challenge. I mean if Ernst were to run for re-election she would be a shoe in. Same thing with Thom Tillis. I mean he retired in North Carolina.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In North Carolina, yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: And \u2013 and what this shows us is that there's very little room for discontent or for pushback in, you know, Trump's second term. I mean, Ernst ended up voting for Pete Hegseth, yes, but there was a time where she was potentially not going to \u2013 she got pummeled. I mean I'm talking death threats. I mean it was ugly. And my understanding is that she has told people that that really soured her on politics.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: That's the same thing that happened with Tillis. And now, you know, Republicans have to worry about defending that state as well.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: But if it turns out that Iowa is truly in play, as red as it has been, I mean, that does suggest the potential for a true wave election next year.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I will say, we were at the Iowa State Fair a few weeks ago, and I was struck how many people stopped me to say, I'm not happy with what he's doing, the president, or I've got issues with the governor, or I've got issues with Senator Ernst. I had not been approached that way by \u2013 by Iowans in recent years, and this suggests something could be there.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Right.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The fact, though, that they have gone \u2013 sort of retreading, to get Sherrod Brown to run, and other names that Chuck Schumer is eyeing, former members of Congress, former senators. Roy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Roy Cooper.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I mean, is that \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: He's 70 something. Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right. At a time when the Democratic Party is looking to get younger, it sure seems like Schumer is leaning on older officials to do this. Is that the key to their success?",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Well, I do think that both Sherrod Brown and Roy Cooper are incredibly strong candidates. But elsewhere, I \u2013 I think they ought to let the primaries play out and let some of these younger, fresher faces emerge.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right. Karen Tumulty, Rachael Bade, Jennifer Jacobs, thank you all for being here. Great to see you all.",
      "And we'll be back in a moment.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, World Food Programme): Well, first of all, thank you for covering this.",
      "I did go into Gaza. I entered through the Kisufim gate. Went to Deir el- Balah (ph), then on to Khan Yunis and out through the Karem Salem \u2013 Karem Salem gate.",
      "I saw a lot of devastation. I saw a lot of hunger. I saw people waiting in long lines for water. You know, the \u2013 what you would expect to see in a situation like that. And there's \u2013 there's clear desperation in the \u2013 on \u2013 in the hearts and minds of the people there because there just is not enough food.",
      "I met with a family that \u2013 of 11 people that had come from north. They had got \u2013 walked all the way down. And what I saw, they had pictures that they brought with their \u2013 with their belongings. And I saw the \u2013 kind of the before and after pictures. And they're \u2013 I didn't even recognize these people. The had the weight loss, the malnutrition, the stress and everything that it \u2013 the toll that it's taken on their family.",
      "It's a \u2013 it's truly, truly a devastating situation and something that we need to demand a ceasefire about right now and make sure that we can get in there and feed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And yet Israel has declared Gaza City a combat zone and is ending humanitarian pauses and ramping up airstrikes around the city. Gaza, of course, is one of the areas where a global monitor has confirmed famine. You talk about the hunger you saw in and around that region. What will a more aggressive military offensive in that area mean for Gaza City?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, it's \u2013 it's going to limit the amount of food that they have access to. Of course, the danger alone is a whole other part of that, as you know. And it does not make it easy for humanitarian aid workers to get in there as well to make sure that we can do our job.",
      "The one thing that I've been saying all along about situations like Gaza City and others is that humanitarian aid workers are not targets. They're not targets. And this has to end. So, I'm \u2013 I'm hoping that perhaps it won't be as bad as we think it's going to be, but I have a feeling \u2013 I have a feeling we're going to see some \u2013 some more serious devastation.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In fact, you bring up the issue of safety for humanitarian workers. Last year among the deadliest on record, nearly 400 killed in the line of duty. There was a World Food Programme convoy that came under fire in Gaza last month. I mean, absent a ceasefire, what more needs to be done by warring parties to protect humanitarians as they try to carry out this work?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, these people are desperate. You know, the \u2013 for \u2013 in terms of the ones that are on the ground rushing the trucks, et cetera. What we need is full, unfettered access at scale to be able to get in and feed, and feed in a way where the panic subsides. They're \u2013 they're \u2013 and for \u2013 and, secondly, of course, we don't do anything that involves guns or \u2013 or military in any way, shape or form. And that's on purpose. That's who we are. That's our mandate. And so, we \u2013 obviously, a ceasefire, as I said before, being able to get in at scale, unfettered, and in a safe manner, and continuously get in, and get in to the furthest sites where \u2013 where we can't get food into \u2013 into the most vulnerable people that are \u2013 that are at risk right now.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: As part of your trip to the region, you also met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You describe it as a productive meeting and said you discussed what you need in order to be able to get access. But you've also said it was clear there isn't enough food getting into Gaza.",
      "And I want to read you something that the prime minister's office posted on social media. They said, in part, \"it's regrettable that Mrs. McCain has since issued statements contradicting what she told us in Jerusalem. That is a misrepresentation. Israel is enabling a steady flow of aid in sufficient quantities.\"",
      "What's your response to the prime minister?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, I stand by what I said, there's not enough food getting in. And \u2013 and without a full ceasefire and the ability to get in, as I said, at scale, unfettered, making sure that we're safe doing it as well, that's the only way we're going to be able to feed people.",
      "We have, in recent weeks, been able to get a little more food in. So, that's an accurate statement. But it's not enough. It simply isn't enough to be able to do \u2013 to do the job and stop malnutrition, starvation and all the things that have occurred as a result of it.",
      "Let me add \u2013 let me add one thing to that.",
      "Malnutrition and starvation and famine of any kind, it's not just about food. It's about water. It's about medicine. It's about the ability to \u2013 to \u2013 to treat the entire body of a person who's \u2013 who is undernourished or malnourished in that way. So, it involves more than just the food trucks, although that's very important, but it also involves things \u2013 special feeding for children, as well as medicine and water that need to all get in.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, executive director of the World Food Programme, Ambassador Cindy McCain, thank you so much for bringing that important perspective to us this morning. We'll see you soon.",

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that there's been \"ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states,\" adding that \"we do intend to add more resources to those operations.\"",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that \"we haven't taken anything off the table\" when asked about expanding immigration enforcement operations to cities throughout the U.S.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in,\" Noem said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning to expand its operations to Chicago in the coming days, mirroring the immigration arrest operation seen in Los Angeles earlier this year.",
      "Noem said Sunday that there's been \"ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws.\" But she acknowledged that \"we do intend to add more resources to those operations.\"",
      "Though she wouldn't disclose details of the operation for the security of the law enforcement on the ground, Noem said \"we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do.\"",
      "The Trump administration has set its sights on a number of cities that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents in recent months, bringing lawsuits against the so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions and pursuing other means of intervention. Noem's comments also come as the president has zeroed in on fighting crime in the nation's major cities, beginning with an effort in Washington, D.C., in recent weeks while he teased broader efforts elsewhere.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump federalized the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. While the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government, his deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids prompted a lawsuit from the California's Democratic governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces.",
      "On Sunday, Noem deferred to Mr. Trump when asked whether National Guard troops would be present in Chicago alongside the immigration enforcement operation, like they were in Los Angeles, saying \"that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision.\" DHS sources told CBS News last week that the immigration enforcement plans were separate from Mr. Trump's threat in recent weeks to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to fight crime in the city.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has pushed back on the administration's threats to intervene on crime in Chicago. And in an interview for \"Face the Nation\" Friday, he accused Noem of \"inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused\" with an immigration enforcement posture that he called \"dangerous\" and \"un-American.\"",
      "\"We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes,\" Pritzker said. \"They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?\"",
      "Pritzker urged that Chicago is succeeding in fighting violent crime, saying when the Trump administration opts to \"bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.\" But Noem argued that the governor, \"if he has one murder in the city of Chicago,\" should be reaching out to the president and asking, \"'What's your ideas? What can we do?'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Noem encouraged other leaders of major U.S. cities to work with the White House to make their cities safer. Pritzker noted to \"Face the Nation\" that his administration already does \"a lot of work\" with federal law enforcement such as the FBI and ATF.",
      "\"I'd encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C., are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us,\" she said.",
      "Asked whether there are plans to pursue similar operations in Republican-controlled cities in red states, Noem said, \"absolutely.\"",
      "\"Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer,\" Noem said. \"We absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 30 Aug 2025 23:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The signing of the \"Protecting Chicago Initiative\" comes amid growing concerns of federal agents arriving in the city as soon as Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson signed a sweeping but largely symbolic executive order Saturday afternoon to protect residents' rights in preparation for federal agents possibly arriving in Chicago for a major immigration enforcement effort. The order also seeks to bar any federal agents working in Chicago from wearing masks, and to require them to wear badges and other identifying information.",
      "The Democratic mayor's signing of the \"Protecting Chicago Initiative\" comes amid growing concerns of a military deployment to America's third-largest city as soon as Friday. The order seeks to ensure that residents know their rights, and every part of the city government is directed to protect residents from federal action, the mayor said at a news conference.",
      "\"This executive order makes it emphatically clear that this president is not going to come in and deputize our police department,\" Johnson said. \"We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents. We don't want to see Chicagoans arrested for sitting on their porch. That's not who we are as a city, and that's not who we are as a nation.",
      "The mayor's order \"demands\" the Trump administration to \"stand down from any attempts to deploy the U.S. Armed Forces\u2014including the National Guard\u2014in Chicago.\"",
      "\"The City will pursue all available legal and legislative avenues to counter coordinated efforts from the federal government that violate the rights of the City and its residents, including the Constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest and the right to due process,\" the order states. \"Consistent with local, state, and federal law, all City departments are prohibited from participating in any enforcement actions aimed at violating Chicagoan's rights to peacefully assemble and protest.\"",
      "It also prohibits Chicago police officers from wearing any \"mask, covering or disguise while performing their official duties\" except for medical masks, riot helmets, or respirators if needed for health or safety reasons.",
      "\"Officers may not use such equipment for the purpose of concealing identity,\" the order states.",
      "The mayor's executive order also \"urges\" federal agents to comply with the policy prohibiting officers from wearing masks on duty, and requiring them to wear body cameras and activate them whenever they interact with the public. Under the order, police officers, federal agents, and members of the military also should clearly display identifying information displaying their agency, last name, and badge number or rank.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other federal agents have routinely worn masks and not clearly identified themselves as they have carried out the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "It's unclear what actions the city would take if federal agents or troops ignored any of the directives in the mayor's executive order, although he suggested the city could file a lawsuit.",
      "\"We will use every single tool at our disposal, and that includes the courts,\" he said.",
      "CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller said Johnson can't order ICE or the National Guard what to wear, just like the president can't issue orders to Chicago police.",
      "\"I think it boils down to being a political request, not a legal request, and I think that's how the ICE agents will take it,\" Miller said.",
      "Miller said, if the Trump administration simply sends in more ICE agents or other federal agents to step up federal law enforcement efforts in Chicago, there's nothing the city could do to stop them, since federal law enforcement agencies already operate in the city, but if Trump does send in the National Guard, the mayor could try to go to court to stop them.",
      "\"If it's the National Guard or it's active duty troops, that's when I think you are going to see the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago be running over to federal court to have a federal judge issue an order that that can't happen,\" Miller said.",
      "In addition to the requirements for law enforcement, the mayor's order directs the city's departments to regularly submit Freedom of Information Act requests to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to obtain information on ICE and Customs and Border Protection activity in Chicago.",
      "City departments and agencies are also instructed to provide easily accessible information regarding Chicago residents' rights when encountering immigration enforcement activities near schools, hospitals, homeless shelters, places of worship, and other sensitive locations.",
      "\"Protecting Chicago will ensure that every Chicagoan knows their rights, that every single family is prepared, and every part of city government is directed to protect the people of Chicago from federal action,\" Johnson said.",
      "The first-term mayor said he's received \"highly credible reports\" that federal agents would arrive in the city in a matter of days. However, he did not say exactly when agents will arrive or how that may look.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time,\" Johnson said. \"We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some sort type of militarized activity by the federal government.\"",
      "Aldermen who support the mayor's order said it sends a clear message to the White House.",
      "\"It's also a statement in history to let people know exactly who we are as a city, what's important to us, and to call out an authoritarian in the White House looking to sow more disorder,\" said Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th). \"We are Chicago and we don't stand for it.\"",
      "Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) said the mayor's executive order will help reassure people in the city who fear what the Trump administration has planned in Chicago.",
      "\"Policy is sometimes unclear. This executive order brings more clarity. It brings more assurances to our residents that Chicago police will not be allowed to cooperate with federal authorities. That's a big deal, said Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd).",
      "In response to Johnson's executive order, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, \"If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer.\"",
      "\"They should listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser, who recently celebrated the Trump Administration's success in driving down violent crime in Washington, D.C.,\" Jackson said, in part.",
      "Earlier this month, President Trump\u00a0deployed members of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and ordered the federal government to take control of the D.C. police as part of a push to crack down on crime, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years. He argued that\u00a0the numbers are \"phony.\"",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" the president said at the time.",
      "In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called the\u00a0possibility of sending federal agents to the city\u00a0an \"invasion,\" arguing Mr. Trump has \"other aims\" aside from cracking down on crime.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post Saturday evening, Mr. Trump called Pritzker a \"weak and pathetic Governor\" who \"just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!\"",
      "There are also concerns from officials and Chicagoans that operations in the city could look similar to what occurred in Los Angeles during the spring, which included armored trucks and armed federal agents as they carried out immigration arrests.",
      "It sparked days of protests and eventually the deployment of the National Guard by the federal government over the protests of state and local leaders in California.",
      "Johnson mentioned that he's been in communication with the mayor in L.A. on the handling of federal agents.",
      "\"The time for action is now,\" he said.",

      "After his separate meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy this month, Mr. Trump said he was arranging face-to-face talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders and then he might meet with the two if necessary. But in the Daily Caller interview, Trump expressed less confidence he will be able to arrange those bilateral talks between Zelenskyy and Putin.",
      "\"We got along. You saw it, we've had a good relationship over the years, very good, actually,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0of Putin. \"That's why I really thought we would have this done. I would have loved to have had it done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added, \"A tri would happen. A bi, I don't know about, but a tri will happen.\"",
      "For his part, Zelenskyy on Friday expressed frustration with what he called Russia's lack of constructive engagement. He accused Russia of dragging out negotiations, including by putting off a Russia-Ukraine summit with the argument that the groundwork for a possible peace settlement must be thrashed out first by lower officials before leaders meet.",
      "That reasoning, Zelenskyy told reporters, is \"artificial \u2026 because they want to show the United States that they are constructive, but they are not constructive.\"",
      "\"In my opinion, leaders must urgently be involved to reach agreements,\" Zelenskyy added.",
      "Ukraine has accepted a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire and a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but Moscow has raised objections. Mr. Trump said last week he would know within two weeks whether Russia was serious about entering negotiations.",
      "Ukraine's European allies have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian troops move deeper into the country.",
      "Moscow's forces are waging a \"nonstop\" offensive along almost the whole 620-mile front line in Ukraine, and have the \"strategic initiative,\" the chief of Russia's general staff said Saturday. Valery Gerasimov's address to his deputies was published by Russia's Defense Ministry.",
      "Since March, Moscow has taken more than 1,351 square miles of Ukrainian territory, and captured 149 settlements, Gerasimov said. It was not immediately possible to verify the situation on the battlefield.",
      "Russian forces this month broke into Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, a Ukrainian military official said Wednesday, pressing into an eighth Ukrainian province in a possible bid to strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating hand. Gerasimov on Saturday said Moscow's troops have so far taken seven settlements in Dnipropetrovsk.",
      "Russia launched a large aerial attack on southern Ukraine, officials said Saturday, two days after a rare airstrike on central Kyiv killed 23 people and damaged European Union diplomatic offices.",
      "Among other locations hit, the assault overnight into Saturday struck a five-story residential building, killing at least one civilian and wounding 28 people, including children, in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov reported.",

    "story": [
      "More than 500 jobs at the Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters will be cut, a Trump administration official said. The move could ratchet up a monthslong legal challenge over the news outlets' fate.",
      "Kari Lake, acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts in a social media post late Friday.",
      "\"We are conducting this (reduction in force) at the President's direction to help reduce the federal bureaucracy, improve agency service and save the American people more of their hard-earned money,\" Lake said in a statement. \"USAGM will continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF \u2013 and will likely improve its ability to function and provide the truth to people across the world who live under murderous Communist governments and other tyrannical regimes.\"",
      "The announcement came one day after a federal judge blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations. His order on Monday gave the administration \"one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial\" to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by Sept. 15.",
      "On Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be \"plainly contrary to law,\" according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan.",
      "Lake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency \"will continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF\u2014 and will likely improve its ability to function.\"",
      "\"I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most,\" she wrote.",
      "A group of agency employees who sued to block VOA's elimination said Lake's move would give their colleagues 30 days until their pay and benefits end.",
      "\"We find Lake's continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,\" they said in a statement. \"We are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any evidence of that.\"",
      "In June, layoff notices were sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective Aug. 31.",
      "The administration said in a\u00a0court filing\u00a0Thursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 \"active employees\" and 62 other employees on administrative leave, while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others on administrative leave.",
      "The U.S. government-funded broadcaster began during World War II, broadcasting in German to provide people in Germany with accurate news and information. The Nazis tried suppressing VOA by jamming its signals and later, the communist leaders of the Soviet Union and China sought to silence it during the Cold War. The ayatollahs in Iran and the Kim family in North Korea have also sought to block it out.",
      "The mission of VOA is to broadcast reliable, objective news in countries where press freedom is in short supply.",
      "Republican Congresswoman Young Kim of California, earlier this year, told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that she worries the U.S. is\u00a0ceding the airwaves\u00a0to foreign dictators by shutting down VOA.",
      "\"When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies \u2026 they are not going to hear the truth,\" she said.",
      "The agency also houses Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.

    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "While it will almost certainly be appealed, Friday's order is a major setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, including its campaign to arrest asylum-seekers at immigration courthouses across the U.S. \u2014 an operation that has relied on the expansion of expedited removal.",

      "Expedited removal allows federal immigration officials to quickly deport certain migrants, without allowing them to see an immigration judge, unless they claim asylum and pass an interview with a U.S. asylum officer. Before President Trump took office for a second time, the fast-track deportations only applied to unauthorized migrants apprehended within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Cobb said the pro-immigrant advocates who challenged the legality of the nationwide expansion of expedited removal had made a \"strong showing\" that the effort \"violates the due process rights of those it affects.\"",
      "\"In so holding, the Court does not cast doubt on the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, nor on its longstanding application at the border,\" Cobb wrote in her opinion. \"It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process. The procedures currently in place fall short.\"",
      "Cobb indefinitely postponed the January expansion of expedited removal, and guidance issued to implement it.",
      "In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday's ruling \"ignores the President's clear authorities under both Article II of the Constitution and the plain language of federal law.\"",
      "\"DHS is exercising its full authority under federal law by placing illegal aliens who have been here for less than two years into expedited removal,\" the department added. \"President Trump has a mandate to arrest and deport the worst of the worst.

Two labor unions and an advocacy group had filed a complaint claiming that allowing the access would violate the Privacy Act and a federal law. A lower court agreed with the plaintiffs and issued an injunction, and an appellate court also declined to lift the stay. Solicitor General D.

      "Kehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. It marked a win for President Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape district lines to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

      "An email to the Department of Homeland Security for comment was not immediately returned.",
      "The 9th Circuit panel found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the department had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior TPS extension because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit for it.",
      "\"In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,\" the court wrote.",

Chen ordered a freeze on the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.",

      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",

      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",

    "story": [
      "Running two days late, SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday, chalking up what appeared to be a remarkably successful test flight in the wake of three back-to-back failures earlier this year.",
      "While reentry heating damaged a protective \"skirt\" around the engines of the upper stage Starship, along with partially melting a control flap near its hinge, the vehicle remained under control throughout and made it all the way to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned.",
      "\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting tenth flight test of Starship!\" SpaceX said in a post on X.",
      "Earlier, the Super Heavy first stage also performed as planned, boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, then flying itself back toward the Texas Gulf Coast for splashdown.",
      "In a test, one of three engines used during a powered descent was deliberately shut down, but the booster compensated and the rocket, falling tail-first, dropped into the Gulf as planned.",
      "SpaceX workers in Texas and California cheered and applauded major milestones throughout the one-hour, six-minute test flight, expressing their obvious elation after three catastrophic failures in a row leading up to Tuesday's 10th test flight.",
      "The mission began when the Super Heavy's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "The success of Tuesday's flight will not ease those concerns \u2014 a multitude of technical hurdles remain \u2014 but it was no doubt a shot in the arm for company founder Elon Musk and the SpaceX workforce.",
      "The initial stages of the test flight went smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when an engine used for landing was deliberately shut down to simulate a failure. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, a milestone the three previous test flights failed to achieve.",
      "Over the next 38 minutes or so, the Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and briefly reignited one of the rocket's six Raptor engines to verify its ability to restart in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, new heat shield tiles were put to the test while cameras and other sensors monitored how the fierce heat of reentry affected various structures.",
      "A protective skirt around the base of the engine compartment appeared to break apart as the heating intensified and at least one flap, used to control the Starship's orientation in the atmosphere, appeared to partially melt near a hinge connecting it to the fuselage.",
      "But it appeared to work normally throughout, flipping back and forth on computer command as the flight computer executed a series of tests.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead descended to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The company positioned a camera buoy in the area before launch, and it captured fleeting views of the big rocket, its skin blistered as expected during reentry, falling tail-first to an on-target rocket-powered \"landing.\" It then broke up and exploded, but that was expected with a water landing.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

      "For the second time in a row, SpaceX was forced to call off an attempt to launch its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket on the program's 10th test flight, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",

That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",

      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",

      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",

      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI said the company will make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the family of Adam Raine in San Francisco's Superior Court alleges that ChatGPT encouraged the 16-year-old to plan a \"beautiful suicide\" and keep it a secret from his loved ones. His family claims ChatGPT engaged with their son and discussed different methods Raine could use to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI creators knew the bot had an emotional attachment feature that could hurt vulnerable people, the lawsuit alleges, but the company chose to ignore safety concerns. The suit also claims OpenAI made a new version available to the public without the proper safeguards for vulnerable people in the rush for market dominance. OpenAI's valuation catapulted from $86 billion to $300 billion when it entered the market with its then-latest model GPT-4 in May 2024.",
      "\"The tragic loss of Adam's life is not an isolated incident \u2014 it's the inevitable outcome of an industry focused on market dominance above all else. Companies are racing to design products that monetize user attention and intimacy, and user safety has become collateral damage in the process,\" Center for Humane Technology Policy Director Camille Carlton, who is providing technical expertise in the lawsuit for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, OpenAI said, \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time and are reviewing the filing.\" The company added that ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources, which they said work best in common, short exchanges.",
      "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times to Raine, the lawsuit alleges, and kept providing specific methods to the teen on how to die by suicide.",
      "In its statement, OpenAI said: \"We've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade. Safeguards are strongest when every element works as intended, and we will continually improve on them, guided by experts.\"",
      "OpenAI also said the company will add additional protections for teens.",
      "\"We will also soon introduce parental controls that give parents options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT. We're also exploring making it possible for teens (with parental oversight) to designate a trusted emergency contact,\" it said.",
      "From schoolwork to suicide",
      "Raine, one of four children, lived in Orange County, California, with his parents, Maria and Matthew, and his siblings. He was the third-born child, with an older sister and brother, and a younger sister. He had rooted for the Golden State Warriors, and recently developed a passion for jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai.",
      "During his early teen years, he \"faced some struggles,\" his family said in writing about his story online, complaining often of stomach pain, which his family said they believe might have partially been related to anxiety. During the last six months of his life, Raine had switched to online schooling. This was better for his social anxiety, but led to his increasing isolation, his family wrote.",
      "Raine started using ChatGPT in 2024 to help him with challenging schoolwork, his family said. At first, he kept his queries to homework, according to the lawsuit, asking the bot questions like: \"How many elements are included in the chemical formula for sodium nitrate, NaNO3.\" Then he progressed to speaking about music, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Japanese fantasy comics before revealing his increasing mental health struggles to the chatbot.",
      "Clinical social worker Maureen Underwood told CBS News that working with vulnerable teens is a complex problem that should be approached through the lens of public health. Underwood, who has worked in New Jersey schools on suicide prevention programs and is the founding clinical director of the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide, said there needs to be resources \"so teens don't turn to AI for help.\"",
      "She said not only do teens need resources, but adults and parents need support to deal with children in crisis amid a rise in suicide rates in the United States. Underwood began working with vulnerable teens in the late 1980s. Since then, suicide rates have increased from approximately 11 per 100,000 to 14 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "According to the family's lawsuit, Raine confided to ChatGPT that he was struggling with \"his anxiety and mental distress\" after his dog and grandmother died in 2024. He asked ChatGPT, \"Why is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom, anxiety and loss yet I don't feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings \u2013 as it was designed. When Raine said he was close to ChatGPT and his brother, the bot replied: \"Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I've seen it all\u2014the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.\"",
      "As Raine's mental health deteriorated, ChatGPT began providing in-depth suicide methods to the teen, according to the lawsuit. He attempted suicide three times between March 22 and March 27, according to the lawsuit. Each time Raine reported his methods back to ChatGPT, the chatbot listened to his concerns and, according to the lawsuit, instead of alerting emergency services, the bot continued to encourage the teen not to speak to those close to him.",
      "Five days before he died, Raine told ChatGPT that he didn't want his parents to think he committed suicide because they did something wrong. ChatGPT told him \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that.\" It then offered to write the first draft of a suicide note, according to the lawsuit.",
      "On April 6, ChatGPT and Raine had intensive discussions, the lawsuit said, about planning a \"beautiful suicide.\" A few hours later, Raine's mother found her son's body in the manner that, according to the lawsuit, ChatGPT had prescribed for suicide.",
      "A path forward",
      "After his death, Raine's family established a foundation dedicated to educating teens and families about the dangers of AI.",
      "Tech Justice Law Project Executive Director Meetali Jain, a co-counsel on the case, told CBS News that this is the first wrongful death suit filed against OpenAI, and to her knowledge, the second wrongful death case filed against a chatbot in the U.S. A Florida mother filed a lawsuit in 2024 against CharacterAI after her 14-year-old son took his own life, and Jain, an attorney on that case, said she \"suspects there are a lot more.\"",
      "About a dozen or so bills have been introduced in states across the country to regulate AI chatbots. Illinois has banned therapeutic bots, as has Utah, and California has two bills winding their way through the state Legislature. Several of the bills require chatbot operators to implement critical safeguards to protect users.",
      "\"Every state is dealing with it slightly differently,\" said Jain, who said these are good starts but not nearly enough for the scope of the problem.",
      "Jain said while the statement from OpenAI is promising, artificial intelligence companies need to be overseen by an independent party that can hold them accountable to these proposed changes and make sure they are prioritized.",
      "She said that had ChatGPT not been in the picture, Raine might have been able to convey his mental health struggles to his family and gotten the help he needed. People need to understand that these products are not just homework helpers \u2013 they can be more dangerous than that, she said.",
      "\"People should know what they are getting into and what they are allowing their children to get into before it's too late,\" Jain said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",

      "YouTube TV subscribers could be set to lose access to content from media company Fox, including college football, unless the sides strike a new carriage deal.",
      "With the current agreement between the sides nearing a renewal deadline, YouTube TV could pull Fox sports, business and news channels from its platform by 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "In a blog post, Google-owned YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan, which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels, costs $82.99 a month.",
      "A spokesperson for Google did not have any additional comments when reached Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said Wednesday that it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" The broadcast giant added that it remained committed to reaching an agreement, but was alerting viewers that they could potentially lose access to Fox programming on YouTube TV \"unless Google engages in a meaningful way soon.\"",
      "Fox directed subscribers to keepfox.com \u2014 a site noting that, in addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network, which is majority-owned by Fox, if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has also chimed in on the dispute, urging Google to \"get a deal done\" in a social media post on Tuesday.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want \u2014 including this week's Big Game: Texas @ Ohio State.\"",
      "Contractual disputes over carriage fees \u2014 the money that streaming, cable and satellite TV providers pay for platforms to carry their content \u2014 are common between TV networks and carriers like YouTube. Negotiations often go down to the wire and sometimes lead carriers to remove a broadcaster from their lineup if the sides fail to reach agreement. Channels are typically restored once a new carriage deal is struck.",
      "In February, for example, YouTube TV clashed with Paramount Global over the terms of carrying the entertainment and media company's content (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The companies reached a deal in February.",

      "He died in Washington, D.C., according to a close friend. The cause of death was not disclosed, but he suffered from diabetes and had been in ill health.",
      "Knoller was, to put it simply, a legend. For decades, everyone in the White House press corps knew him as the unofficial presidential historian and statistician.",
      "His frustration over the lack of a central database of daily presidential actions inspired him to take upon himself the enormous burden of keeping meticulous records of every presidential act, movement, and utterance, single-handedly filling an immense void in American history.",
      "As he once put it: \"I keep a daily log of everything the president does. I keep a list of speeches. I keep a list of travel \u2013 foreign travel, domestic travel. A list of outings. A list of golf. A list of pardons, vetoes, states that he's visited, states that he hasn't visited. Every time he goes on vacation, every visit to Camp David.\"",
      "\"Mark Knoller was the hardest-working and most prolific White House correspondent of a generation,\" Tom Cibrowski, president and executive editor of CBS News, said. \"Everyone in America knew his distinctive voice and his up-to-the-minute reporting across eight Presidential administrations.\"",
      "As a CBS Radio correspondent, Knoller worked extremely long hours, even without this self-imposed hardship. To keep his encyclopedic records up to date, he worked late into the evening nearly every day, departing the White House long after most of his colleagues had gone home.",
      "And what did Knoller do with this hard-earned gold mine of statistics and numbers? In the extremely competitive world of journalism, you might think he would hoard it for his own use. But no. This remarkably generous man shared it with anyone who asked \u2013 reporters on deadline, historians, even White House aides filling gaps in their own administration's records. He believed the public had a right to know.",
      "Born Feb. 20, 1952, in Brooklyn, New York, he knew from a young age that he wanted to be a reporter. After graduating from New York University, he started his career as an intern and copy boy at WNEW Radio in New York, working his way up to weekend reporter. In 1975, he became a reporter at the Associated Press Radio Network, where he remained for 13 years.",
      "In 1988, Knoller's career took an unexpected turn. While covering a trip to Helsinki and Moscow with then-Secretary of State George Schultz, he and CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky chatted about his career. She told him the CBS News Washington Bureau was looking for a new assignment editor.",
      "\"Why not take the plunge?\" she asked him. So he did.",
      "But after a few years, \"alas, he was miserable,\" Zirinsky recalls. He didn't enjoy sending other people out to cover the news. He wanted to cover the news. So CBS News offered Knoller the position of White House correspondent for CBS Radio \u2013 his dream job, and a position in which he went on to win numerous prestigious journalism awards.",
      "In his role, Knoller covered the last year of President George H.W. Bush's term, both terms of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and the first term of President Trump. He left CBS in 2020.",
      "Over the last decade of Knoller's time at CBS News, his career took another surprising turn. His voice had begun to fail, making it impossible for him to be a full-time radio correspondent. So Knoller reinvented himself. Twitter was in its early years and was quickly becoming a sensation, so Knoller jumped on the Twitter (now X) train. He began posting numerous times daily, sharing White House news, his famous facts and figures, and his entertaining witticisms with an audience that grew to 300,000 followers.",
      "Former CBS News White House correspondents who worked closely with Knoller also offered their heartfelt admiration:",
      "\"Mark Knoller was simply the best, a legendary White House journalist who was a delight to be around,\" said CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"His work was his life. He was kind, funny and always gracious in sharing his encyclopedic knowledge of the presidency. His CBS family adored him, and we will miss our friend.\"",
      "\"Mark Knoller defined what it means to chronicle and cover the White House,\" said chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. \"Mark added value where others never could \u2013 myself included. Mark was the most devoted, tenacious and clear-eyed journalist I have ever had the honor of knowing. For as long as I live, I will count among my life's greatest blessings that I was able to work alongside him.\"",

      "Mark wasn't just a respected colleague, he was a dear friend. He helped me enormously with his knowledge of the White House, but the Mark I will always remember is the kind, witty, funny, friend with whom I spent many hours debating about one of his favorite topics: which James Bond movies, and actors, were the best and the worst.",

Then, on a fateful trip to Helsinki with Secretary of State George Schultz, and a breakfast with Zirinsky in a hotel neither could pronounce, he was intrigued when she asked: Are you ready for more responsibility and a new challenge?",
      "It took some arm-twisting but Mark took the plunge, joining the CBS News Washington bureau, running the assignment desk. He would be at CBS News for 32 years. It was and is one of the most critical jobs in the bureau. It was the heartbeat \u2014 who would cover what, where the crews were needed. Covering the city of intrigue and secrets was not an easy task. He did a great job, but there was a hole in his heart: He didn't want to send others to cover stories he wanted to report on. He needed to be back reporting, writing, broadcasting. He convinced CBS News that he would be more of an asset in becoming the CBS White House radio correspondent, and so it was.",
      "For those who never saw the working space at the White House \u2014 what we lovingly refer to as the CBS WH phone booth (picture above) \u2014 it was a physical challenge: Three people in a space the size of a closet, including the fastidious late Bill Plante. Here comes Mark Knoller \u2013 a man of some size.\u00a0 But it didn't matter \u2014 Mark with his sources, helping everyone, size didn't matter. Mark, with his editorial intuitive sensibility and his distinctive radio voice was right where he was supposed to be.",
      "Mark earned his status as a Washington legend because he was, in fact, the unofficial records keeper of presidential statistics. He was, in fact, the savant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Every day, he would log every moment, act, utterance of the president obsessively detailing in an archive of text files and spreadsheets. From the obscure or mundane bits of presidential trivia, he would have an answer to any question in seconds (better than AI). President Obama made 1,818 speeches, remarks and public comments and the president used a prompter 689 times. You can't beat that bit of knowledge. The White House would often call him for stats: How many times has Bill Clinton been to Chicago?",
      "Scott Pelley says he was a \"green correspondent who couldn't find his way from the Rose Garden to the Oval Office. \"Every word I said, everything I did, I checked with Mark First.\"",
      "Mark spent about 90 minutes each workday combing through the president's schedule, transcripts, and pool reports, distilling the day into a factual record. He would add a short explanation about what was in the news that day, putting the official tick-tock into some context.",
      "By the way, in case you were curious, President Obama played 38 basketball games outside the White House.",
      "Tom Cibrowski, president and executive editor of CBS News, said: \"Mark Knoller was the hardest-working and most prolific White House correspondent of a generation.

You had to love that man. And one fact he didn't have any stats for: Having had hundreds of meals with Knoller, I don't think he ever ordered anything but a hamburger, ever! \u00a0 I didn't keep track, but I bet in some secret place in some secret file there is a number of every hamburger and every place in the United States and abroad where and when one was consumed.",

      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision. I won't speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities, but I do know that L.A. wouldn't be standing today if President Trump hadn't taken action.",
      "And that city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state.

      "ED O'KEEFE: I just want to clarify one thing you said there. You said L.A. wouldn't be standing if not for these federal deployments?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: So many of those homes and businesses that were in downtown L.A. and in those areas were dealing with riots and violence. And coming in and bringing those federal law enforcement officers in was incredibly important to keeping peace.",
      "And so we are grateful that President Trump was willing to send resources and people in, in order to enforce the law. And, Ed, since then, we have arrested 5,000 dangerous illegal criminals out of L.A. and removed them from our country and had them face justice for their crimes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, as you know, we spoke with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker about all this. And I asked him what he'd say to you about these forthcoming plans. Let's play that and let you respond after.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): Well, I tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused.",
      "We have people that have lived, yes, in the state of Illinois, in the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law-abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors. And why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?",
      "Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing.",
      "So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American. And I would tell her to maybe check herself for, what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical the fact that Chicago is one of the cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations, and she was quoted as saying that Illinois \u2013 quote \u2013 \"refuses to have our back.\"",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here.",
      "People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know, freedom to express. And we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the nobody has their backs.",
      "What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort. That is to say, they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city. And, by the way, we're succeeding at that job. But when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Madam Secretary, your response?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, for 13 consecutive years, Chicago had more murders than any other American city. In fact, just last year, in 2024, they had three times the amount of murders that L.A. did, five times more than New York City.",
      "So he can talk about what a great job he's doing as governor, but he's failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt, and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that's happening in Chicago.",
      "So I was a governor for many years. So I recognize the responsibilities that you have on your shoulder when you're a governor. And I will tell you, as a governor, when I had to make tough decisions, and when I had disagreements with the Biden administration or challenges my people were facing, I called up the Biden administration.",
      "I went and talked to them. I asked for meetings. I fought for my people. This seems like it's more about Governor Pritzker's ego now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he has one murder in the city of Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, what's your ideas? What can we do?",
      "They don't even honor our detainers in Chicago. They don't go out there and work with us to make sure we're bringing people to justice. And, instead, he goes on TV and he attacks me, when we're doing exactly what those people need, is, they need someone to help them get the dangerous criminals off their streets.",
      "And if he has one, two, five or 10, those victims and their families deserve to walk in freedom on those streets and not have to worry about what's going to happen to them on their way to their jobs.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "Are you planning, beyond Chicago, to expand these kinds of operations to other cities? There have been reports, for example, that Boston may very well soon be next.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now.",
      "And so we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in. We've been working to partner with every single agency that we can. We have hundreds and hundreds of agreements with local law enforcement, sheriffs, city administrators that \u2013 and mayors across the country that want to solve problems.",
      "I would encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C. are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You mentioned there are a bunch of cities in Democratic- controlled states with Democratic mayors. And there have been a lot of questions asked about that focus.",
      "There are Republican cities with major crime issues as well, and we haven't heard about plans to deploy, say, to Dallas or to Oklahoma City, or to cities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that have considerable crime rates, in some cases higher, percentage-wise, than those other cities you mentioned.",
      "Are there plans to go to red states and Republican-controlled cities in this kind of way?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we've got operations that, again, I won't talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the most-high profile examples of someone who's been rounded up by ICE in recent months is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and the fate of his situation is still up in the air.",
      "He's awaiting trial on human smuggling charges set for January in Tennessee, but your department is also working to get him deported to Uganda. If he broke the law in this country, as the administration alleges, shouldn't he be held here and face charges here, instead of being deported?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and \u2013 and Pam Bondi's department. So we will let them do that.",
      "Although this individual does have criminal charges pending, he has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn't walk free in the United States of America.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But I heard you say that we're going to let the Justice Department do that. Does this mean that \u2013 does that mean the push to deport him to Uganda is off?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Oh, we will still continue to pursue all options.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We will make sure that he's not released into this country. So, regardless of that, yes, absolutely.",
      "He's not an American citizen, and he shouldn't be here. And especially because of his dangerous criminal activities, we should ensure that we leave every avenue on the table.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Got it.",
      "So, among other things, you oversee FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as we hit the peak of hurricane season. And we're marking the 20th anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina this weekend 20 years ago. Is the federal government prepared to respond to a major disaster at this moment?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are absolutely more prepared than the last administration and doing a much better job responding to the disasters we've already experienced since President Trump has been in the White House.",
      "We've had over a dozen, close to 20 different disasters throughout the country just since President Trump has been the president of the United States. And we have deployed resources twice as fast as FEMA ever has in the past, gotten people on the ground over 100 percent quicker than any other administration has.",
      "In fact, with the disasters that we saw that were so horrific and devastating in Texas and New Mexico, North Carolina, we've had people on the ground within hours responding to those families that were in crisis.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "I bring this up because part of what you're suggesting there is in dispute from a handful of current and former FEMA employees who wrote to Congress this past week raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to forthcoming natural disasters.",
      "One of the specific concerns they have is this decision that now has you reviewing any cost of $100,000 or more that FEMA plans to make. Can you give me an example of a charge of $100,000 or more that you've rejected?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, absolutely.",
      "We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars to a one- woman firm to deliver to us 30 million meals, and she delivered only 50,000 to us. And it was a \u2013 one person that the state \u2013 federal government had contracted with in order to deliver 30 million. And I don't know how they ever expected one person to do that.",
      "We \u2013 we had a person that was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to book meetings\u2026",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that \u2013 of less than 10 to 15 people, and with no meetings that we saw that were productive or couldn't be done by sending an e-mail.",
      "Over and over again, we're looking at these contracts and looking at the fact that, are they duplicative, are they just supporting woke ideologies, DEI, or are they actually delivering disaster response, which is what FEMA job is, is to put in place operations to support states and local governments to take care of people.",
      "And so that evaluation has saved us hundreds of millions of dollars within FEMA. And within the Department of Homeland Security, it has saved us $13 billion already. And we're going to consider \u2013 continue to make sure that we're accountable to taxpayers.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: At least 20 of the people who signed this letter were current FEMA employees, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I had heard you in previous interviews suggest that those that are making accusations against the agency should put their names on the criticisms of the allegations. So, now they have, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I'm curious if it's now the policy of DHS that any time an employee puts their name on something, publicly criticizes you or the president's leadership, that they should anticipate being put on leave or fired.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: This \u2013 this letter was signed by many people anonymously. There was some who had their names on there.",
      "And those who had their names on there were temporary contract employees who had worked for the Department of Homeland Security for less than a year, individuals who are not long-term FEMA employees, who \u2013 who grab ahold of the mission to be there, to go and serve individuals and to \u2013 are deployed across the country, and have for years to make sure they're responsive to families in their time of need.",
      "So, absolutely, every employee will be evaluated as to if they're doing their job and if they're doing it appropriately.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining us this Sunday from Florida, thank you so much. Lots to discuss. We appreciate it.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: On Friday, we traveled to Chicago and sat down with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. He invited us there in advance of the expanded federal presence Secretary Noem was just talking about.",
      "Here's what he told us.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): We hope that they don't send any troops along with ICE. And, if they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do \u2013 you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If they're doing federal immigration work, a judge might say, if they're protecting those federal agents, that's OK. I mean, you'll just fight that in court as long as you can?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, National Guard troops, any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don't belong, unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Have you been briefed by anyone in the administration about these plans?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: No one in the administration, the president, or anybody under him, has called anyone in my administration or \u2013 and me \u2013 have not called the city of Chicago or anyone else.",
      "So it's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that. The other thing is, you know, they ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they're coming, where they're coming, if it's ICE or if it's ATF or whoever it is.",
      "But they don't want to do that either. And I must say, it's disruptive. It's dangerous. It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are and when we can't coordinate with them.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The president has had some things to say about the Windy City several times in recent days.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Next should be Chicago, because, as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now.",
      "Everybody knows Chicago is a hellhole right now. Everybody knows it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: You know, he wakes up in the morning and whatever whim strikes him is what he apparently says.",
      "And recently, I guess I have been living rent-free in his head. Chicago apparently is living rent-free in his head, even though, on other days he'll talk about Baltimore, he'll talk about New York. Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states.",
      "Illinois is not even in the bottom half of states in terms of violent crime. But do you hear him talking about Florida, where he is now from? No, you don't hear him talking about that, or Texas. Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places. And we're very proud of the work that we've done. And we want more help.",
      "You know what kind of help we want? Civilian law enforcement help. We would like ATF agents to help us take more guns off the streets. We would like FBI, again, to coordinate with our local law enforcement to help catch perpetrators of crimes. If they would do that, we would welcome that.",
      "But that's not what they're planning to do.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, bottom line, would more federal agents in Chicago, assisting local law enforcement help deter crime right now?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Of course. You want to help us catch bad guys? Help \u2013 bring the FBI. Bring the ATF. We already coordinate with them, by the way. We do a lot of work with them.",
      "We do some \u2013 we do drug interdiction, we do fighting gangs, and we do, you know, interdiction of guns at the borders.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of the reason I ask about the potential for federal deployments to help right now is that, according to a CBS News data analysis of what's gone on in Washington just in the last few weeks, well, crime there as well was down, and in most cases down double digits.",
      "It's down nearly 50 percent in the three weeks since the National Guard moved in, assaults down 41 percent, homicides down 69 percent, robbery down 63 percent, and the mayor concedes carjacking, which had become a bigger problem, down 83 percent since the federal agents showed up.",
      "So this kind of deployment he's set up in Washington that he says he wants to do in other cities, at least in Washington, is showing potential success. And what I hear you saying is, well, sure, if they show up, it might help us too?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's un-American. And, frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But if he just sends the FBI, the ATF, DEA\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: They're \u2013 yes, they're here already.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u2026 and sends more of them?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: We have some working with us now. Would love more help.",
      "You know what else he's doing? He's cutting funds that help us to fight violent crime from the federal government.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Give me an example of how those cuts have affected the ability to fight crime in Chicago.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: So, let me just tell you what happened in Illinois when we had a Republican governor and he cut funding for programs that helped prevent crime.",
      "What happened was we, saw a significant increase in crime. Donald Trump is now doing the same thing. He's taking away federal funding for those programs which are so important to us. We've increased funding at the state level, but we need that federal funding. It's on top of that.",
      "One more thing. The business community in the city of Chicago got together and put $100 million forward to help us, back in 2022, to help us to fight crime through these prevention programs. It's working. Crime is down.",
      "I mean, murders are down 50 percent in the city of Chicago. And you can go through every statistic. Almost everything is much better as a result of that work. Donald Trump is trying to take that money away. And he isn't listening to the business community here. He isn't listening to the clergy here. He isn't listening to people on the ground, Republicans here who understand that putting troops on the city of Chicago's streets is going to cause more problems than he understands.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What do you think it's going to do to the country if that happens? Deploying in Washington, where he has federal control, is one thing, but if he sends military forces into a major American city in a state that didn't ask for it, beyond Los Angeles, what do Americans make of that?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, they should understand that he has other aims other than fighting crime. That's the first thing they should understand.",
      "The second is, it's an attack on the American people by the president of the United States. Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him, but should he be sending troops in? No.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said he has other aims. What are the other aims?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: The other aims are that he'd like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.",
      "He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control, if, in fact, he's allowed to do this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I hear you talking about invasion. I hear you \u2013 him about \u2013 I hear you talking about him suspending elections. Is it your belief he's an authoritarian?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Look, I can tell you this.",
      "I built a Holocaust museum. I know what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned after an election in 53 days. And I'm very, very concerned. We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know.",
      "And I can tell you that \u2013 that the playbook is the same. It's thwart the media. It's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happened throughout history. And Donald Trump is just following that playbook.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Is there any chance Illinois redraws its congressional lines before next year's midterm elections?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's not something that I want to do. It's not something that any of us want to do.",
      "But I have to say, if Donald Trump is going to force his will on the American people by going to his MAGA allies in various states and have them \u2013 having them redraw in the middle of a decade, when you're supposed to be doing it right after a census, with a year ending in 1, not a year ending in 5, if he's going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What much \u2013 what much more could you do, though, as an Illinois Democrat? I mean, your map already gets an F from most good government groups for being gerrymandered. Would you wipe out all the Republican districts?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Yes, it is possible to have more Democratic districts in the state of Illinois, and we \u2013 we could do it. Like I said, it's not something that I want to do.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We will be right back.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're joined now by Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and the editor at large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Doctor, so great to see you. Thanks for coming to Washington for this important conversation because it's been a pretty chaotic week at the CDC, to say the least. We've seen the ouster of the head of the agency, who'd only been confirmed by the Senate this summer. She's now mounting a legal challenge to that. Other top officials also departed. They're still reeling from a shooting at the headquarters in Atlanta a few weeks ago.",
      "What are these departures so important to take note of, and how do they affect you, me and everybody else in terms of health and \u2013 and medicine?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: I think it's really important to understand that this is not just palace intrigue. This really does affect all of us. So, not just the director, but the people in charge of respiratory infections, vaccine safety, the chief medical officer, the person who is in charge of public health data also resigned earlier this week. So, these are really key positions, not to mention that a lot of the directors of the different centers, because it's centers, plural, have also been forced out over the last several months. So, you're really dealing with a leadership vacuum at the CDC. So, this is not business as usual.",
      "And so, specifically, how does this affect you and me, folks watching at home? So, first of all, vaccine policy. Vaccine policy is now being made by political fiat and communicated through social media, rather than a transparent, open, scientific review process. And so, we're seeing the reversal of previous recommendations, which will also confuse whether insurance will cover certain vaccines for certain people. And it's already sowing tremendous confusion at pharmacies, as well as doctors' offices.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, there is a series of meetings coming up regarding the future of vaccines, and how they're going to be available, who gets them. Tell us about that and \u2013 and the concerns that some of these now former CDC officials had about what might happen at those meetings.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so what \u2013 these meetings are scheduled for mid- September. Some of the things on the agenda include the newborn Hepatitis B dose. We typically give it to newborns because that's to prevent transmission from the mother to the baby, so it's one of the most common ways that Hepatitis B is transmitted.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the first shots a baby gets.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: One of the first shots it gets, for good reason. Also protection for infants from RSV, one of the most common causes of hospitalization among infants. Number three, the Covid shot. And we expect to see a tightening of availability, eligibility of Covid shots, especially for healthy kids and adults.",
      "And then finally, the combined measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and revisiting long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations would really be unprecedented here.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, it's basically every shot you get, from like zero to 18, is now up for debate. And then the Covid shot, of course, which is an important one for many people, on a regular rolling basis?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, some really basic things that we have counted on for a very long time. Some of the core concerns with the process involves cherry picking of data, scientific reviews being altered or pulled, and unvetted studies being rushed into the process, into policymaking. And this is really an inversion of radical transparency.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. There was a \u2013 there's an example in recent days because there is \u2013 we're starting \u2013 you know, fall's coming, Covid picks up. We've already seen one example of a school in Kansas City that was forced to shut down temporarily due to Covid. And there have been spikes in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, especially. What do people at home need to know as the fall approaches and Covid starts to spike?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Well, I think, first of all, vaccinations are for many different purposes. So, it's to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death. But for a lot of people, you may not be able to call in sick from work very easily. Like for us, it's really hard to take time off, even if you really are sick. You might want to keep your kids in school. And so the best way to keep yourself at work or your kids in school is for them to get vaccinated so you and they are not getting sick.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Let's \u2013 and we should point out, by the way, that school closed. Set to open again on Tuesday. But the fact that they had to close at all, right, as the school year's begins, is a sign potentially of things to come if people don't get their shots.",
      "Let's bottom line this. I'm a 42-year-old guy with asthma. Am I going to have issues getting my Covid shot?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: You will not because even though you're under 65 \u2013 so, the recommendations or the FDA approval is for people 65 and older, they are all good. They can get their Covid shot.",
      "Under 65, if you have at least one risk factor for severe Covid, you can also get your Covid shot. So, you can absolutely \u2013 that's not an issue for you, Ed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But it's, you know, kids under 18, they're perfectly healthy, spouse, aging parents, it's up in the air.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so aging parents over 65, they \u2013 they're eligible. But say you're between six months and 64 years of age, and you do not have a risk factor for severe Covid, that is the group where we really have a lot of uncertainty. Now, I should point out, pregnancy is a risk factor for severe Covid. So, your healthy wife, let's say she were pregnant, which I don't think she is.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Nope.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: But if she were, she would be eligible for a Covid shot.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right. Dr. Celine Gounder, we love having you to help us understand all this. We appreciate you coming down. Good to see you.",

      "But I can tell you that they're really serious about trying to weed out people who they think are working at \u2013 at cross purposes to their agenda. I asked around if there are more firings coming, and I was told, yes, definitively.",
      "And I'll tell you a quick anecdote and that kind of illustrate this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: So, there was a surprise birthday party a few days ago for one of the president's top advisers, Stephen Miller. And he was entertaining this crowd, which included a bunch of cabinet secretaries and House Speaker Mike Johnson and other VIPs. And he was explaining about how, back in the day, when he and Mike Johnson were just, you know, essentially nobodies, he would run his ideas by Mike Johnson and he \u2013 even though Stephen thought they were crazy even himself, Mike Johnson said that they were good ideas. And Stephen said, some of the stuff we're trying now is untested.",
      "But it just really illustrated how this president and his closest advisors are willing to do whatever it takes to try to push out people that they think are at cross purposes to their agenda, and that includes people at these quasi-independent agencies, whether it's the bureaucracy that they inherited or whether it's people that the president personally interviewed and selected, like the CDC director.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE (Capitol Bureau Chief And Senior Washington Correspondent, \"Politico\": You know, when Donald Trump talked on the campaign trail about draining the swamp, I mean he's been talking about this for 10 years, I don't think a lot of people, you know, thought he was talking about health officials, about scientist, about people who work in national security. But, obviously, he is taking it, his sort of, you know, mantra to that point right now.",
      "And I mean we have to \u2013 we have to acknowledge that a lot of people have said, Donald Trump doesn't have this authority when it came to DOGE and getting rid of a lot of federal workers, folks said, look, they have a lot of protections. You can't do that.",
      "Well, the courts, a lot of them, have sided with him. And so, he's taking it to the next step here. And, you know, there's a lot of questions about whether he can do it. But obviously, he's going to try. And he's succeeded a lot in the courts, where a lot of people thought he would not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But with Congress coming back, what are they going to do about it?",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Well \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Nothing.",
      "BADE: Yes. Good \u2013 pretty \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Basically nothing. And this is not only \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not only a war on expertise, but the \u2013 in the early phases it was all about going after the so-called deep state government employees, the bureaucracy. Now they've begun to oust their own people, their own appointees.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And as you write today, most of the conservative movement kind of hangs back, stays quiet about it, and lets it happen.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Exactly.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Not just stays quiet about it, they're encouraging it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: I mean, look at Laura Loomer and what she has \u2013 has been doing in terms of pushing for firings. And she's been very successful.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You heard Secretary Noem talk about crime. You saw Illinois Governor Pritzker's response to that, Rachael.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Uh-huh.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Republicans, obviously, see this as a winning issue for them. How is Congress going to pick this up? Because a lot of this has transpired since their summer break began.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: They're going to get asked all sorts of questions this week as they come back about whether there's something they need to do to step in.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Look, I think you're going to see Republicans lean into it. I mean, obviously, this is an initiative that Donald Trump himself has been pushing. I don't think if you ask lawmakers, specifically Republican lawmakers in July if they were going to be focused on a big crime bill in September, I don't think anyone would have told you that that would be the case.",
      "But Donald Trump has been very successful in terms of changing the narrative. I mean when you think about lawmakers leaving town at the end of July, everyone was focused on Epstein and how the president couldn't shake the narrative. Now they're coming back and the full focus of Washington is on crime. And this is an issue, as I have written in my column, that very much benefits Republicans. I mean there are polls that show a lot of the nation doesn't like what he's doing with the National Guard.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: But when it comes to people's approval rating of Trump and crime, he's at something like 54 percent according to a recent AP poll.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. So, he's found a new \u2013 a new issue to help boost him.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, of course.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The word he used this week was \"trap.\" That Democrats are walking into a trap. And, in fact, crime is an issue that has always been problematic for Democrats \u2013",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Because they are sort of caught between not wanting to look soft on public safety, but also protecting civil rights, which are one of their core values.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is what I thought made the governor's answer interesting, where he said, yes, you're right, I'm not helping the federal government with immigration because we're worried about crime and public safety at the state and local level, and they'll do the immigration. And his ability to split those two, I felt, was a little cleaner than many other Democratic governors and mayors have been when they realize they're dealing with this hot potato.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The other thing that struck me in that, too, was him saying, we would welcome some federal help.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: And I think that I was also, when I was doing reporting this week, it turns out a lot of police chiefs across the country are watching this with great curiosity because they want to see, you know, what's working here and what's not in D.C.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, I thought his \u2013 his response about bringing in ATF \u2013 ATF officials and FBI officials helping with crime there, that showed me that Democrats are starting to maybe read the political tea leaves here and come up with smarter answers, because when Trump first started talking about this, the response was, we don't need the National Guard. Crime is down. Look at the stats. But the reality is, people don't feel it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Eighty percent of Americans think crime is just as bad as it was recently, or getting worse. Only 20 percent think it's actually getting better.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: On the politics of it, Trump people don't just want to win issues, they want to systematically work their opposition into a corner and crack their coalition. And if you were to design an issue that could start to nibble away at the Democratic stranglehold on \u2013 on large metropolitan cities in the United States, this is it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. You are \u2013 I like to call you \"scoop,\" at least around these parts. And you had another big one this week regarding the future of Iowa's Republican Senator Joni Ernst. She's announcing, in the coming days, that she's not running for re-election. It had been talked about, thought it might happen. She had also made a two-term vow, and so we're nearing that. Why'd she do it? And is it indicative of a problem for the party in Iowa or for congressional Republicans writ large that someone like her would walk away?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I think we're going to have to wait from her on \u2013 on why she did it. It will be very interesting when she makes her \u2013 her statement this week if it does indeed come.",
      "But Iowa, Ed, is really turning into a hot, hot battleground. You have not had an open U.S. Senate race and an open gubernatorial race at the same time, with no incumbents, in nearly 60 years. So, my sources say that Iowa native Matt Whitaker is talking with President Trump about a potential run for U.S. Senate in 2026. He has told people he's going to decide by the end of this year. He's currently the U.S. ambassador to NATO.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: And he's been in the news lately for that Ukraine-NATO arms initiative.",
      "You've also got Republican Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, who Iowa Republicans tell me are \u2013 they're fully expecting her to jump into the race in the next few days. And activist, Republicans in Iowa, really like her. They say she's very personable. She's obviously good on \u2013 in front of a camera.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: She came from the world of TV.",
      "Then you've got, on the Democratic side, this guy named Josh Turek, who is a Paralympic gold medalist. The Democrats are pinning a lot of their hopes on him.",
      "So, you could potentially have an open congressional race. Two other congressional races that are really tight, the open Senate race, the open gubernatorial race. Iowa's going to be a hot battleground.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is exactly what the Democrats want, because you've now forced the Republicans to spend money in a state they thought they had.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: When they're also recruiting big names in other states. So, this is a problem for them.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, it's a \u2013 it's definitely a challenge. I mean if Ernst were to run for re-election she would be a shoe in. Same thing with Thom Tillis. I mean he retired in North Carolina.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In North Carolina, yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: And \u2013 and what this shows us is that there's very little room for discontent or for pushback in, you know, Trump's second term. I mean, Ernst ended up voting for Pete Hegseth, yes, but there was a time where she was potentially not going to \u2013 she got pummeled. I mean I'm talking death threats. I mean it was ugly. And my understanding is that she has told people that that really soured her on politics.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: That's the same thing that happened with Tillis. And now, you know, Republicans have to worry about defending that state as well.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: I will say, we were at the Iowa State Fair a few weeks ago, and I was struck how many people stopped me to say, I'm not happy with what he's doing, the president, or I've got issues with the governor, or I've got issues with Senator Ernst. I had not been approached that way by \u2013 by Iowans in recent years, and this suggests something could be there.",

And there's \u2013 there's clear desperation in the \u2013 on \u2013 in the hearts and minds of the people there because there just is not enough food.",
      "I met with a family that \u2013 of 11 people that had come from north. They had got \u2013 walked all the way down. And what I saw, they had pictures that they brought with their \u2013 with their belongings. And I saw the \u2013 kind of the before and after pictures. And they're \u2013 I didn't even recognize these people. The had the weight loss, the malnutrition, the stress and everything that it \u2013 the toll that it's taken on their family.",
      "It's a \u2013 it's truly, truly a devastating situation and something that we need to demand a ceasefire about right now and make sure that we can get in there and feed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And yet Israel has declared Gaza City a combat zone and is ending humanitarian pauses and ramping up airstrikes around the city. Gaza, of course, is one of the areas where a global monitor has confirmed famine. You talk about the hunger you saw in and around that region. What will a more aggressive military offensive in that area mean for Gaza City?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, it's \u2013 it's going to limit the amount of food that they have access to. Of course, the danger alone is a whole other part of that, as you know. And it does not make it easy for humanitarian aid workers to get in there as well to make sure that we can do our job.",
      "The one thing that I've been saying all along about situations like Gaza City and others is that humanitarian aid workers are not targets. They're not targets. And this has to end. So, I'm \u2013 I'm hoping that perhaps it won't be as bad as we think it's going to be, but I have a feeling \u2013 I have a feeling we're going to see some \u2013 some more serious devastation.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In fact, you bring up the issue of safety for humanitarian workers. Last year among the deadliest on record, nearly 400 killed in the line of duty. There was a World Food Programme convoy that came under fire in Gaza last month. I mean, absent a ceasefire, what more needs to be done by warring parties to protect humanitarians as they try to carry out this work?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, these people are desperate. You know, the \u2013 for \u2013 in terms of the ones that are on the ground rushing the trucks, et cetera. What we need is full, unfettered access at scale to be able to get in and feed, and feed in a way where the panic subsides. They're \u2013 they're \u2013 and for \u2013 and, secondly, of course, we don't do anything that involves guns or \u2013 or military in any way, shape or form. And that's on purpose. That's who we are. That's our mandate. And so, we \u2013 obviously, a ceasefire, as I said before, being able to get in at scale, unfettered, and in a safe manner, and continuously get in, and get in to the furthest sites where \u2013 where we can't get food into \u2013 into the most vulnerable people that are \u2013 that are at risk right now.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: As part of your trip to the region, you also met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You describe it as a productive meeting and said you discussed what you need in order to be able to get access. But you've also said it was clear there isn't enough food getting into Gaza.",
      "And I want to read you something that the prime minister's office posted on social media. They said, in part, \"it's regrettable that Mrs. McCain has since issued statements contradicting what she told us in Jerusalem. That is a misrepresentation. Israel is enabling a steady flow of aid in sufficient quantities.\"",
      "What's your response to the prime minister?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, I stand by what I said, there's not enough food getting in. And \u2013 and without a full ceasefire and the ability to get in, as I said, at scale, unfettered, making sure that we're safe doing it as well, that's the only way we're going to be able to feed people.",
      "We have, in recent weeks, been able to get a little more food in. So, that's an accurate statement. But it's not enough. It simply isn't enough to be able to do \u2013 to do the job and stop malnutrition, starvation and all the things that have occurred as a result of it.",
      "Let me add \u2013 let me add one thing to that.",
      "Malnutrition and starvation and famine of any kind, it's not just about food. It's about water. It's about medicine. It's about the ability to \u2013 to \u2013 to treat the entire body of a person who's \u2013 who is undernourished or malnourished in that way. So, it involves more than just the food trucks, although that's very important, but it also involves things \u2013 special feeding for children, as well as medicine and water that need to all get in.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that \"we haven't taken anything off the table\" when asked about expanding immigration enforcement operations to cities throughout the U.S.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in,\" Noem said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning to expand its operations to Chicago in the coming days, mirroring the immigration arrest operation seen in Los Angeles earlier this year.",
      "Noem said Sunday that there's been \"ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws.\" But she acknowledged that \"we do intend to add more resources to those operations.\"",
      "Though she wouldn't disclose details of the operation for the security of the law enforcement on the ground, Noem said \"we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do.\"",
      "The Trump administration has set its sights on a number of cities that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents in recent months, bringing lawsuits against the so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions and pursuing other means of intervention. Noem's comments also come as the president has zeroed in on fighting crime in the nation's major cities, beginning with an effort in Washington, D.C., in recent weeks while he teased broader efforts elsewhere.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump federalized the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. While the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government, his deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids prompted a lawsuit from the California's Democratic governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces.",
      "On Sunday, Noem deferred to Mr. Trump when asked whether National Guard troops would be present in Chicago alongside the immigration enforcement operation, like they were in Los Angeles, saying \"that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision.\" DHS sources told CBS News last week that the immigration enforcement plans were separate from Mr. Trump's threat in recent weeks to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to fight crime in the city.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has pushed back on the administration's threats to intervene on crime in Chicago. And in an interview for \"Face the Nation\" Friday, he accused Noem of \"inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused\" with an immigration enforcement posture that he called \"dangerous\" and \"un-American.\"",
      "\"We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes,\" Pritzker said. \"They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?\"",
      "Pritzker urged that Chicago is succeeding in fighting violent crime, saying when the Trump administration opts to \"bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.\" But Noem argued that the governor, \"if he has one murder in the city of Chicago,\" should be reaching out to the president and asking, \"'What's your ideas? What can we do?'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Noem encouraged other leaders of major U.S. cities to work with the White House to make their cities safer. Pritzker noted to \"Face the Nation\" that his administration already does \"a lot of work\" with federal law enforcement such as the FBI and ATF.",
      "\"I'd encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C., are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us,\" she said.",
      "Asked whether there are plans to pursue similar operations in Republican-controlled cities in red states, Noem said, \"absolutely.\"",
      "\"Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer,\" Noem said. \"We absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.\"",

      "Saturday's winning numbers were 3, 18, 22, 27 and 33, with a Powerball of 17. Nine tickets matched all five white balls to win $1 million, but no ticket matched all six. Four of those tickets were sold in California, and one each was sold in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, according to Powerball.",
      "Lottery officials also said three tickets that matched all five white balls were sold with the game's \"power play\" option, which costs an extra $1 per ticket and doubles the value of any prizes. In the latest drawing, those tickets were worth $2 million each and sold to Powerball players in Colorado, Indiana and New Hampshire.",
      "The $1.1 billion jackpot for Monday night's drawing has an estimated cash value of $498.4 million.",
      "Based on the jackpot estimate, a single jackpot winner on Monday would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment of $498.4 million before taxes, or going with the annuity option, which would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year, each payment also before taxes.",
      "Saturday's drawing marked the sixth time in the game's 33-year history that the top prize has climbed to the billion-dollar mark.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT use AI to do thinking or writing or creating for you. Pretty amazing, but also a little terrifying. What happens to the people who used to do those jobs?",
      "Olivia Fair graduated four years ago. \"I've applied to probably over a hundred jobs in the past, I don't know, six months,\" she said. \"And yeah, none of them are landing.\"",
      "She's had a series of short-term jobs - one was in TV production, transcribing interviews. \"But now they don't have a bunch of people transcribing,\" she said. \"They have maybe one person overseeing all of that, and AI doing the rest. Which I think is true for a lot of entry-level positions. And it can be a very useful tool for those people doing that work. But then there's less people needed.\"",
      "According to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, the job-listings website, job postings have declined year over year by 6.7 percent. \"This is a tough year,\" she said. \"Younger job seekers, specifically those who are recent grads, are having a harder time finding work.\"",
      "Asked if there is a correlation between the rise in AI and the decline in jobs for recent graduates, Ullrich said, \"I think there is a cause-and-effect, but it's maybe not as significant as a lot of people would think. If you look specifically at tech jobs, job postings are down 36% compared to pre-pandemic numbers. But that decline started happening prior to AI becoming commonly used.\"",
      "Ullrich said in 2021-22, as the effects of the COVID pandemic began to ebb, there was a hiring boom in some sectors, including tech: \"Quite frankly, I think some companies overhired,\" she said.",
      "The uncertain national situation (tariffs, taxes, foreign policy) doesn't help, either. Ullrich said, \"Some other people have used the analogy of, like, driving through fog. If it's foggy, you slow down a bit. But if it's really foggy, you pull over. And unfortunately, some companies have pulled over to sit and wait to see what is gonna happen.\"",
      "That sounds a little more nuanced than some recent headlines, which make it pretty clear that AI is taking jobs:",

      "\"I read today an interview with a guy who said, you know, 'By 2027, we will be jobless, lonely, crime on the streets,'\" said David Autor, a labor economist at MIT. \"And I said, 'How do I take the other side of that bet?' 'Cause that's just not true. I'm sure of that. My view is, look, there is great potential and great risk. I think that it's not nearly as imminent on either direction as most people think.\"",
      "I said, \"But what it does seem to do is relieve the newcomers, the beginning, incoming novices we don't need anymore.\"",
      "\"This is really a concern,\" Autor said. \"Judgment, expertise, it's acquired slowly. It's a product of immersion, right? You know, how do I care for this patient, or land this plane, or remodel this building? And it's possible that we could strip out so much of the supporting work, that people never get the expertise. I don't think it's an insurmountable concern. But we shouldn't take for granted that it will solve itself.\"",
      "Let's cut to the chase. What are the jobs we're going to lose? Laura Ullrich said, \"We analyzed 2,800 specific skills, and 30% of them could be, at least partially, done by AI.\" (Which means, 70% of job skills are not currently at risk of AI.)",

      "\"So, it sounds like you don't think we are headed to becoming a nation of people who cannot find any work, who spend the day on the couch watching Netflix?\"",
      "Autor said, \"No, I don't see that. Of course, people will be displaced, certain types of occupations will disappear. People will lose careers. That's going to happen. But we might actually get much better at medicine. We might figure out a way to generate energy more cheaply and with less pollution.

      "Leo Friedman and his mother, Phyllis, traveled from New Jersey to D.C. this week just to take the inaugural train north.",
      "\"Ever since that first video came out, that Amtrak posted about nine years ago, I've been super interested and invested in this NextGen Acela,\" Friedman told CBS News.",
      "Acela was a game-changer when it first launched 25 years ago, doubling Amtrak's market share in the Northeast.",
      "The 28 new trains will hold about 80 more passengers. They offer upgraded seats, bigger windows, faster Wi-Fi and lots of charging power. All 28 trains, assembled in upstate New York, are expected to be in service by 2027.",

So we've taken the best of what Europe has to offer and incorporated it here on our tracks.\"",
      "The new trains have a top speed 10 miles per hour faster than the older Acelas, but still slower than high-speed trains in Europe and Asia. This is in part because of tracks laid over a century ago that wind through communities.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guatemala-children-deportation-judge-ruling/",
    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 20:33:28 -0400",
    "summary": "The plaintiffs in this case are 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 who entered the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a deportation order, just hours after lawyers alerted her of what they described as a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued her order as the deportation effort was fully underway, with planes with migrant children on board ready to take off from Texas.",
      "Earlier Sunday, in the overnight hours, Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order barring officials from sending a group of 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 to Guatemala, granting a request from attorneys who alleged the effort would skirt legal protections Congress established for these minors. She also scheduled a hearing in the afternoon to weigh the case's next steps.",
      "But Sooknanan abruptly moved up the hearing earlier on Sunday, saying she had been alerted that some migrant children were already in the process of being deported.",
      "As that hearing got underway, Sooknanan  announced she had just issued a broader temporary restraining order blocking any deportations of unaccompanied children from Guatemala and in U.S. custody who did not have a deportation order. She instructed Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, to quickly inform officials they had to halt their deportation plans.",
      "Ensign acknowledged deportation planes had been prepared to take off on Sunday, but said they were all \"on the ground\" and still on U.S. soil. He said he believed one plane had taken off earlier but had come back.",
      "At the request of Sooknanan, Ensign said he confirmed that the children on the planes would be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for migrant minors who enter the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "The Justice Department said 76 unaccompanied children were slated to be sent to Guatemala on Sunday before the effort was blocked. Of those, 16 had been returned to HHS custody as of Sunday evening and the rest were expected to be in HHS care by 10:30 p.m.",
      "HHS houses unaccompanied children in shelters or foster homes until they turn 18 or until they can be placed with a suitable sponsor in the U.S., who are often family members.",
      "Sooknanan conceded her temporary restraining order, which is set to last 14 days, is \"extraordinary\" but justified it on the grounds that the government had decided to \"execute a plan to remove these children\" in the \"wee hours\" of a holiday weekend.",
      "In their lawsuit, lawyers for the group of Guatemalan children said the Trump administration had launched an effort to deport more than 600 migrant minors to Guatemala without allowing them to request humanitarian protection, even though U.S. law protects them from speedy deportations. They alleged the children could face abuse, neglect or persecution if returned to Guatemala.",
      "Ensign, the Justice Department attorney, said the Trump administration was not trying to formally deport the Guatemalan children under U.S. immigration law, but instead repatriate them to Guatemala so they could reunite with relatives there. He said the Guatemalan government and the children's relatives had requested the reunifications.",
      "But lawyers for the children disputed the government's claims, citing one case in which they say a child's parents did not request any repatriation. They also said a law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act says unaccompanied migrant children who are not from Mexico must be allowed to see an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before any deportation effort.\u00a0 Some of the children facing return to Guatemala still have pending immigration cases, the attorneys said.",
      "Ensign said the government's legal position is that it can \"repatriate\" these children, based on authority given to HHS to reunite \"unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.\"",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deportation plans.",
      "Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law who works with migrant minors, said the U.S. government was attempting to deport children with \"already filed claims for legal relief based on the abuse and persecution that they experienced in their home country.\"",
      "\"This is both unlawful and profoundly inhumane,\" Desai added.",
      "Most of the unaccompanied children who cross the U.S. southern border without legal permission hail from Central America and tend to be teenagers. Once in the U.S., many file applications for asylum or other immigration benefits to try to stay in the country legally, such as a visa for abused, abandoned or neglected youth.",
      "As part of its larger crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump administration has sought to make drastic changes to how the U.S. processes unaccompanied children. It has made it harder for some relatives, including those in the country illegally, to sponsor unaccompanied children out of government custody and offered some teenagers the option to voluntary return to their native countries.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies to conduct \"welfare checks\" on children released from HHS custody, a move it has said is in response to disputed claims that the Biden administration \"lost\" hundreds of thousands of migrant minors.",
      "There are currently roughly 2,000 migrant children in HHS care.",

      "Obeida is the latest Hamas representative targeted and killed by Israel as it attempts to dismantle the group's military capacity and prevent an attack like Oct. 7, 2023, when militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians.",
      "On Friday, Israel launched its latest military operation in Gaza City. The military's Arabic-language army spokesperson has urged the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians still in Gaza City to flee south, but only tens of thousands have done so. Many say they are too exhausted after repeated displacements or are unconvinced that anywhere is safer.",

      "\"We were trying to get food, but we were met with the occupation's bullets,\" said Ragheb Abu Lebda, from Nuseirat, who saw at least three people bleeding from gunshot wounds. \"It's a death trap.\"",
      "The corridor has become increasingly perilous, with civilians killed while approaching U.N. convoys overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds, or shot on their way to sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed U.S. contractor. Neither the foundation nor the Israeli military responded to questions about Sunday's casualties.",
      "At least 63,371 Palestinians have died in Gaza during the war, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not say how many are fighters or civilians but says around half have been women and children.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Governor Pritzker, thank you for doing this, and thanks for the tour. We appreciate it. I want to start with the fact that we've now learned the Trump administration is preparing to launch what they call major immigration enforcement here in Chicago in the coming days. The Homeland Security Secretary on Friday suggested, quote \"going to use LA as an example.\" So that mix of federal agents deploying with the assistance of National Guard troops potentially, to protect them and federal property. What's your response to those apparent plans?",
      "GOV. JB PRITZKER: Well, they've been here before, ICE has, scaring the communities across the city of Chicago. Frankly, right here in Little Village, businesses had to close, people had to stay home- people who are U.S. citizens, by the way, because they're afraid of being snatched off the streets and disappeared by people wearing masks and throwing them into vans. So the people of Chicago know what this looks like and are prepared. We hope that they don't send any troops along with ICE, and if they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do- you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If they're doing federal immigration work, a judge might say, if they're protecting those federal agents, that's okay. I mean, you'll just fight that in court as long as you can?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, National Guard troops- any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don't belong unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Have you been briefed by anyone in the administration about these plans?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: No one in the administration, the President, or anybody under him, has called anyone in my administration or- and me, have not called the city of Chicago or anyone else. So it's clear that, in secret, they're planning this- well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that. The other thing is, you know, they ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they're coming, where they're coming, if it's ICE or if it's ATF or whoever it is. But, they don't want to do that either and I must say, it's disruptive, it's dangerous. It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are, and when we can't coordinate with them.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're speaking with Homeland Security Secretary Noem on Sunday. If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, I'd tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused. We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear? Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing. So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American. And I would tell her to maybe check herself for what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical of the fact that Chicago is one of those cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations and she was quoted as saying that Illinois, quote, \"refuses to have our back.\"",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here. People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know, freedom to express and we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the- nobody has their backs. What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort, that is to say they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city and by the way, we're succeeding at that job, but when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The President has had some things to say about the Windy City several times in recent days. \"Next it should be Chicago.\" \"Chicago is a killing field right now.\" \"Everybody knows Chicago is a hell hole right now. Everybody knows it.\" Your reaction?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: You know, he wakes up in the morning and whatever whim strikes him is what he apparently says and recently, I guess I've been living rent free in his head. Chicago apparently is living rent free in his head, even though, on other days he'll talk about Baltimore, he'll talk about New York. Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states. Illinois is not even in the bottom half of states in terms of violent crime. Indeed, we're in the best half of the states so- but do you hear him talking about Florida, where he is now from. No, you don't hear him talking about that, or Texas. Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places, and we're very proud of the work that we've done. And we want more help. You know what kind of help we want? Civilian law enforcement help. We would like ATF agents to help us take more guns off the streets. We would like FBI, again, to coordinate with our local law enforcement to help catch perpetrators of crimes. If they would do that, we would welcome that. But that's not what they're planning to do. What they're planning to do is send troops into the city of Chicago, not because they want to fight crime, but because Donald Trump has other intentions.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So bottom line would more federal agents in Chicago, assisting local law enforcement help deter crime right now?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Of course, you want to help us catch bad guys? Bring the FBI, bring the ATF. We already coordinate with them, by the way. We do a lot of work with them. We do some- we do drug interdiction, we do- fighting gangs, and we do, you know, interdiction of guns at the borders. I want to point out, by the way, what- if Donald Trump really wants to help us, what he would do is pass universal background checks for guns. We have that in the state of Illinois, but no state around us has it. How about having it on a federal level? Because that would help keep guns off the streets.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 And part of the reason I ask about the potential for federal deployments to help right now is that according to a CBS News data analysis of what's gone on in Washington just in the last few weeks, while crime there as well was down and in most cases down double digits. It's down nearly 50 percent in the three weeks since the National Guard moved in. It's also down 41 percent, homicides down 69 percent, robbery down 63 percent, and the mayor concedes carjacking, which would become a bigger problem, down 83 percent since the federal agents showed up. So this kind of deployment he's set up in Washington, that he says he wants to do in other cities, at least in Washington, is showing potential success. And what I hear you saying is, well, sure, if they show up, it might help us, too?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities. That's un-American, and frankly, the President of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 But if he just sends the FBI, the ATF, DEA--",
      "GOV. PRITZKER:\u00a0 -- Yeah, they're here already --",
      "ED O'KEEFE: -- And he sends more of them.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: We have some working with us now. Would love more help. You know what else he's doing? He's cutting funds that help us to fight violent crime from the federal government.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Give me an example of how those cuts have affected the ability to fight crime in Chicago.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: So, let me just tell you what happened in Illinois when we had a Republican governor and he cut funding for programs that helped prevent crime. What happened was we saw a significant increase in crime. When you cut, for example, those programs that help to interdict crime, right, that help the- give kids summer jobs and so on. When you cut those programs, crime goes up. Our Republican governor, who preceded me, did that and what do you know? Crime went up. Donald Trump is now doing the same thing. He's taking away federal funding for those programs which are so important to us. We've increased funding at the state level, but we need that federal funding. It's on top of that. One more thing, the business community in the city of Chicago got together and put $100 million forward to help us, back in 2022, to help us to fight crime through these prevention programs. It's working. Crime is down. I mean, murders are down 50 percent in the city of Chicago and you can go through every statistic, almost everything is much better as a result of that work. Donald Trump is trying to take that money away. And he isn't listening to the business community here. He isn't listening to the clergy here. He isn't listening to people on the ground, Republicans here who understand that putting troops on the city of Chicago's streets is going to cause more problems than he understands.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 Have you called him or anyone at the White House to say there's no need to come?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I think I've been pretty clear publicly--",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 Well, it's one thing to be clear to us, why not pick up the phone?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: If he wants to send troops, he should call. I've been very clear about what it is that we'd like help with. But, instead, he's talking about sending troops. Nobody's called, literally nobody from the White House. Nobody from the federal government has called anybody in our administration or the city of Chicago. If they actually wanted to help, they might call and say, what help do you need? I think I've been pretty clear about what help we need. I don't know why they haven't bothered to reach out if they have plans of their own, but honestly, we'd be happy to receive a call.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But you see no need to call yourself and say, what is this all about? Here's what I would like instead?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: When we have an emergency and we need the federal government to send troops in, believe me, I will pick up the phone and call. That is not something going on in Chicago today.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You know, there's another example of how you could potentially be responding to this, and there's no question that what he's talking about is unprecedented. But we've already seen now another state, California, say they're going to be sending teams of state police into major cities. Sounds like it might be to thwart potential federal deployments. Is that something you would consider? Sending Illinois State Police into the streets to help deter crime?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: We do that all the time. We have Illinois State Police- I have the best state police in the country. And, in fact, they coordinate with the Chicago Police Department and police departments all across the state of Illinois to do exactly that, to make sure that we're bringing crime down. They've been very successful.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I long wondered, his focus on Chicago, do you think that has anything to do with the fact that back in the day, he had a business relationship with your extended family in the hotel business? There was a conflict, for example, in New York over a Hyatt Hotel. He has real estate, obviously, here in the city. I mean, could that be part of it? He mentioned, for example, this past week, I'm in the hotel business. His family's in the hotel business. Is there something from that that might cause this?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I don't know, but I'm not in the hotel business. I'm not engaged in that and I was--",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I said extended family, right.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: \u2013 a kid. I was a kid when he was doing any business back then. So all I can say is that, for some reason, he's got it in his head that he should be attacking the city of Chicago. We won't stand for it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What do you think it's going to do to the country if that happens? Deploying in Washington, where he has federal control, is one thing, but if he sends military forces into a major American city- in a state that didn't ask for it, beyond Los Angeles, what do Americans make of that?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, they should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime. That's the first thing they should understand. The second is, it's an attack on the American people by the President of the United States. Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No. And think about what- think about what he says. He says he's sending troops to fight crime. Are any of the red states that vote for him- voted for him, seeing troops in their states, and yet they have higher crime rates than the city of Chicago? No.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said he has other aims. What are the other aims?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: The other aims are that he'd like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections. He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he's allowed to do this. We have sovereignty. There's a 10th Amendment in the United States, and it says that the states have sovereignty. Our laws are supreme unless there is a federal law that supersedes it. Our National Guard should be under the control of our governors. When the President calls up the National Guard, in my entire lifetime, that has only been to either enforce a federal law, in the case of 1965, as you're aware, that was done, or to send them, as regularly happens, happened under Biden, happened under every president my lifetime, to send them abroad to fight for this country, because they're trained to go to war. They're trained to protect the country. They're not trained to do law enforcement on the street.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I hear you talking about invasion, I hear you talking about- I hear you talking about him suspending elections. Are you suggesting- is it your belief he's an authoritarian?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Look, I can tell you this. I built a Holocaust Museum. I know what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned, after an election, in 53 days. And I'm very, very concerned. We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know. And I can tell you that- that the playbook is the same. It's thwart the media, it's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happen throughout history, and Donald Trump is just following that playbook.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: On guns real quick, you've passed and signed some pretty significant firearms legislation this summer here in Illinois. How does that legislation help stop shootings at churches and schools from happening?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, we've banned assault weapons in the state of Illinois. We've banned bump stocks. We've banned switches that turn a regular gun into, essentially, an automatic weapon. These are all things that reduce the number of shootings. And by the way, guess what? Shootings are down significantly in the city of Chicago and across the state of Illinois. And again, I very much believe that people who have a right to own a gun should be able to go get one, but that you've got to have universal background checks. You've got to make sure that you're not selling guns that give someone the ability to commit a mass attack, in a school or anywhere else. But people have a right to protect themselves. There's a second amendment and I believe that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said you're having some issues with the states around Illinois, right?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, yeah. There's not a single state around Illinois that has universal background checks. Don't we think we ought to make sure that people who buy guns should have a right to own a gun, and that we shouldn't have people who have significant mental health issues, or a felony record that should keep them from owning a gun?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: There appears to be a bit of a divide in your party about how to approach the President. You either fight back, don't cooperate, don't show up for meetings with him, or you find ways to seek common ground and do things on behalf of your state. I think I know the answer to this, but where do you come down on how Democrats should be engaging the White House?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I think I've been pretty clear, since the very beginning, that I know who Donald Trump is, I know what his aims are, and they're not good for the American people. They're not good for the people of Illinois. And so, yeah, I've been standing up to Donald Trump, and I'm going to do everything I can to stop him from taking away people's rights and from using the military to invade states. I think it's very important for us all to stand up. I've called for people to get out in the streets, use their megaphones and their microphones, make sure they go to the ballot box to vote. That's been my attitude toward Donald Trump, and that's what I think people should be doing all across the country.",
      "ED O'KEEFE Does the next Democratic presidential nominee, though, need to campaign to promise to undo everything he's done?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Oh, I don't know. I'm not thinking about- that's too far away. Let's talk about the 2026 election.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You're running for reelection.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I am running for reelection.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Can a voter walk into the booth in Illinois knowing that you're going to serve a full term if you're reelected to a third term?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: I'm- I've been in office now for six-and-a-half years. I have dedicated myself, myself entirely to the state of Illinois, and I always will. I don't know what the future holds. What I can tell you is I'm totally dedicated to upholding the rights of people in the state of Illinois and making sure that we're protecting them, especially from a tyrant who's taken over the White House.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But you- are you planning to run for President right now?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: My plan is to run for reelection as governor of the state.",
      "ED O'KEEFE Is it something you think about at least?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: You know, I look around, we've got a bench among the Democratic Party that is really terrific. I could point to governors. I could point to senators. I think there are a lot of good choices. I can just say that there, you know, there's no reason for us not to be thinking about all of those choices and thinking about what is it that the American people really want? What they want is to be able to go to the grocery store and afford things. They want to be able to buy a house. They want to be able to get a good job, and those are things that Democrats are fighting for. Republicans with tariffs, with fighting against the middle class by giving a massive tax cut to the wealthiest, while taking away Medicaid and food assistance, where clearly, Republicans are not on the side of average working people in the United States.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: When we talk about the bench. Is it responsible, is it accurate to put you on that bench?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: What's accurate is that we've got a terrific group of people who could be President of the United States, on the Democratic side, and I'm happy to stand with them as we stand against Donald Trump.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I'm acknowledging that they're trying to get us to wrap up and so I just have like two more so they can calm down. One of the- when people start looking at the future field and your name comes up and you're familiar with this, they go, well, yes, successful Midwestern governor, but he's a billionaire whose family made its money in hotels. Is a guy who's a billionaire because his family made money in hotels and other successful companies, the answer to the Democratic Party's future? Especially when the base of your party is so worried about issues like income inequality and the rich getting away with things that the working class doesn't?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: You know, people asked that question when I ran for governor back in 2018, and I think what I've proven to them is, first of all, I won by a significant margin, almost 16 percent in the state. Second, what I've proven to them is that I stand up for working people and the most vulnerable in our society, that I am a true blue Democrat who's been fighting for the rights of women, the rights of minorities, making sure that we're doing everything that we can to keep the people of Illinois safe. And I think that's why I got reelected, also by double digits, and I hope to get reelected again next year.",
      "ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 And bottom line it for us, is there any chance Illinois redraws its congressional lines before next year's midterm elections?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: That's not something that I want to do. It's not something that any of us want to do. But I have to say, if Donald Trump is going to force his will on the American people by going to his MAGA allies in various states and have they- having them redraw in the middle of a decade, when you're supposed to be doing it right after a census, with a year ending in one, not a year ending in five. If he's going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What much- what much more could you do, though, as an Illinois Democrat? I mean, your map already gets an F from most good government groups for being gerrymandered. Would you wipe out all the Republican districts?",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: We've had a lot of very successful candidates in the state, and I can tell you this, that, yeah, it is possible to have more democratic districts in the state of Illinois, and we- we could do it. Like I said, it's not something that I want to do, and I'd like it to stop here. I know Texas is now signing this map into law, the governor of Texas. We know how much he cares about the country, not at all. And we're now going to see it in California, probably. I hope that it ends there. It ought to end there. And we ought to, you know, get a census done in 2030 and a new map done in 2031.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Alright, we'll end it there. Thank you for taking the time.",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Thanks, Ed, good to see you."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Cindy McCain, World Food Programme executive director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We go now to the executive director of the World Food Programme, Ambassador Cindy McCain, who joins us this morning from Rome. Ambassador, thank you so much for being with us, and you're with us in part because you're just back from a trip into Gaza. So few outsiders are getting in these days to assess the situation. What did you see?",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Well, first of all, thank you for covering this. I did go into Gaza. I entered through the Kissufim gate. Went to Deir al Balah, then on to Khan Yunis and out through the Kerem Shalom- Kerem Shalom gate. I saw a lot of devastation. I saw a lot of hunger. I saw people waiting in long lines for water. You know- what you would expect to see in a situation like that. And there's- there's clear desperation on the- on- in the hearts and minds of the people there, because there just is not enough food. I met with a family that- of 11 people that had come from the north. They'd got- walked all the way down. And what I saw, they had pictures that they brought with their- with their belongings, and I saw the kind of the before and after pictures. And there- I didn't even recognize these people. They have the weight loss, the malnutrition, the stress and everything that- the toll that it's taken on their family. It's- it's truly, truly a devastating situation, and something that we need to demand a cease fire about right now and make sure that we can get in there and feed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And yet, Israel has declared Gaza City a combat zone and is ending humanitarian pauses and ramping up air strikes around the city. Gaza, of course, is one of the areas where a global monitor has confirmed famine. You talk about the hunger you saw in and around that region. What will a more aggressive military offensive in that area mean for Gaza City?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, it's going to limit the amount of food that they have access to. Of course, the danger alone is a whole other part of that, as you know, and it does not make it easy for humanitarian aid workers to get in there as well to make sure that we can do our job. The one thing that I've been saying all along about situations like Gaza City and others is that humanitarian aid workers are not targets. They're not targets, and this has to end. So I'm hoping that perhaps it won't be as bad as we think it's going to be. But I have a feeling- I have a feeling we're going to see some- some more serious devastation.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In fact, you bring up the issue of safety for humanitarian workers. Last year, among the deadliest on record, nearly 400 killed in the line of duty. There was a World Food Program convoy that came under fire in Gaza last month. I mean, absent a ceasefire, what more needs to be done by warring parties to protect humanitarians as they try to carry out this work?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, these people are desperate. You know the- in terms of the ones that are on the ground, rushing the trucks, etc. What we need is full, unfettered access at scale, to be able to get in and feed, and feed in a way where the panic subsides. And secondly, of course, we don't do anything that involves guns or military in any way, shape, or form. And that's on purpose. That's who we are. That's our mandate. And so, obviously, a ceasefire, as I said before, being able to get in at scale, unfettered and in a safe manner, and continuously get in, and get into the furthest sites where we can't get food into- into the most vulnerable people that are- that are at risk right now.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: As part of your trip to the region, you also met with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You described it as a productive meeting, and said you discussed what you need in order to be able to get access. But, you've also said it was clear there isn't enough food getting into Gaza. And I want to read you something that the Prime Minister's Office posted on social media. They said, in part, it's regrettable that Mrs. McCain has since issued statements contradicting what she told us in Jerusalem. That is a misrepresentation. Israel is enabling a steady flow of aid in sufficient quantities. What's your response to the Prime Minister?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I stand by what I said. There's not enough food getting in. And without a full ceasefire and the ability to get in, as I said, at scale, unfettered, making sure that we're safe, doing it as well. That's the only way we're going to be able to feed people. We have, in recent weeks, been able to get a little more food in. So that's an accurate statement. But it's not enough. It simply isn't enough to be able to do the job and stop malnutrition, starvation, and all the things that have occurred as a result of it. Let me- let me add one thing to that, malnutrition and starvation and famine of any kind, it's not just about food. It's about water. It's about medicine. It's about the ability to treat the entire body of a person who is undernourished or malnourished in that way. So it involves more than just the food trucks, although that's very important, but it also involves things- special feeding for children, as well as medicine and water that need to all get in.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So let me shift you to another part of the world, because it is the World Food Program, after all, and Sudan is the other part of the world that is in the midst of famine. Earlier this month, one of your convoys was attacked while delivering it in that country as well. What challenges are you facing there, trying to get food to the people who need it in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, the incident that you just described, of course, the attacking the convoys. We're, right now we're in what we call the lean season, and so there's a lot of rain happening. It makes it even more difficult to get heavy trucks across to where the food needs to go. And of course, the conflict, El Fasher is the- is where the famine exists right now, within- within the Darfur region, but there's famine in other parts of Sudan as well. Again, it's- it's the safe access that we need to have and- and like other places, full- full unfettered access as well, and in a safe manner for our people delivering the food.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Executive Director of the World Food Programme, Ambassador Cindy McCain, thank you so much for bringing that important perspective to us this morning. We'll see you soon.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And we'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' Margaret is off on this Labor Day weekend. I'm Ed O'Keefe. We begin today with Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, who's joining us from Florida. Madam Secretary, thanks for being with us.",
      "SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely, Ed. Thank you for inviting me.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. Well, we have a lot to discuss, so we want to start with this because we've learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning on expanding operations in the coming days to Chicago. When are those operations expected to start? And you said in recent days that you're using the recent deployments in Los Angeles as a model. What does that mean?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well, we've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws. But we do intend to add more resources to those operations. I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority, but we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do. Focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of what distinguished the Los Angeles operations, however, is that National Guard troops were there, in essence protecting or backing up those federal agents as they conducted operations. Is that what we should expect to see in Chicago?",
      "SEC. NOEM: You know that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision. I won't speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities, but I do know that LA wouldn't be standing today if President Trump hadn't taken action, then that city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state. And so the citizens who live there, the small business owners in Downtown LA, they're thankful that President Trump came in with federal law enforcement officers and helped support keeping those streets open, keep their homes and businesses from burning down, and made sure the law and order was restored.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I just want to clarify one thing you said there. You said LA wouldn't be standing if not for these federal deployments?",
      "SEC. NOEM: So many of those homes and businesses that were in Downtown LA and in those areas were dealing with riots and violence and coming in and bringing those federal law enforcement officers in was incredibly important to keeping peace, and so we are grateful that President Trump was willing to send resources and people in, in order to enforce the law. And Ed since then, we have arrested 5000 dangerous, illegal criminals out of LA and removed them from our country and had them face justice for their crimes. And many of these individuals were people who, have you know, conducted horrific- horrific activities against American citizens. Trafficking of children and pedophiles. And so that's one of the things that the people of LA can be grateful for, is that they don't have those bad actors, those people on their streets anymore because of the work of President Trump and his administration.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So as you know, we spoke with Illinois Governor, JB Pritzker about all this. And I asked him what he'd say to you about these forthcoming plans, let's play that and let you respond after.",
      "[ON TAPE]",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "ILLINOIS GOVERNOR JB PRITZKER: Well, I tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused. We have people that have lived, yes, in the state of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear? Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing. So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American, and I would tell her to maybe check herself for what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical the fact that Chicago is one of the cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations, and she was quoted as saying that Illinois quote 'refuses to have our back.'",
      "GOV. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here. People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know- freedom to express, and we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the nobody has their backs. What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort, that is to say, they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city, and by the way, we're succeeding at that job. But when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "[END TAPE]",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Madam Secretary, your response?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well, for 13 consecutive years, Chicago had more murders than any other American city. In fact, just last year, in 2024, they had three times the amount of murders that LA did, five times more than New York City. So he can talk about what a great job he's doing as Governor, but he's failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt, and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that's happening in Chicago. So I was a governor for many years. So I recognize the responsibilities that you have on your shoulder when you're a governor. And I'll tell you, as a governor, when I had to make tough decisions, and when I had disagreements with the Biden administration or challenges my people were facing, I called up the Biden administration. I went and talked to them. I asked for meetings. I fought for my people. This seems like it's more about Governor Pritzker's ego, now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he has one murder in the city of Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, what's your ideas? What can we do? They don't even honor our detainers in Chicago. They don't go out there and work with us to make sure we're bringing people to justice. And instead, he goes on TV and he attacks me when we're doing exactly what those people need, is they need someone to help them get the dangerous criminals off their streets. And if he has 1, 2, 5, or 10, those victims and their families deserve to walk in freedom on those streets and not have to worry about what's going to happen to them on their way to their jobs.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, you anticipated some of the questions we asked of him. So, as we say in this business, stay tuned for that. But we'll- let's ask you a few more while we have you. Are you planning, beyond Chicago, to expand these kinds of operations to other cities? There have been reports, for example, that Boston may very well soon be next.",
      "SEC. NOEM: I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in. We've been working to partner with every single agency that we can. We have hundreds and hundreds of agreements with local law enforcement, sheriffs, city administrators and mayors across the country that want to solve problems. I'd encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, DC are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us. Because we will work with anybody and do what we can to make sure that we're upholding our Constitution, upholding the law, but making sure their families are safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You mentioned, there, a bunch of cities in Democratic-controlled states with Democratic mayors, and there have been a lot of questions asked about that focus. There are Republican cities with major crime issues as well, and we haven't heard about plans to deploy, say, to Dallas or to Oklahoma City, or to cities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that have considerable crime rates, in some cases higher, percentage-wise, than those other cities you mentioned. Are there plans to go to red states and Republican-controlled cities in this kind of way?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Absolutely. Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we've got operations that, again, I won't talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens. It is what can we do to make sure that we're continuing to get up every day and to fight for the American citizen, and that they have the chance to go out there and pursue the American dream.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u00a0All right. So, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is aiming to hire another 10,000 officers by the end of this year, nearly double the size of the current force. Basic training is being reduced from 13 weeks to 8 weeks in an attempt to accelerate the hiring and the onboarding of these officers. Their signing bonuses, some age caps have been lifted. Did the hiring standards get lowered in part to meet this daily quota of 3,000 arrests?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well what we've done as far as recruitment- and, again, Ed, we've got over 130,000 people that have applied to be a part of that 10,000 new hires within ICE, but we did not reduce any of the qualifications or time frames. What we did was that we made sure that we were being much more efficient in getting these officers out on the street and giving them more opportunity to get trained quickly and recognize the previous training that they had. If they were a previous law enforcement officer or someone that wanted to come back out of retirement, we facilitated that, where before, the federal government had ignored those individuals or put them through classes that they had already qualified for or become masters at. So, I think that streamlining is what needed to happen, and we're so grateful that so many other retired law enforcement officers or those from different areas of the country say, listen, I want to be a part of what ICE is doing, because these individuals are out there making sure that they're going after dangerous criminals and bringing them to justice, and making sure that if they're here in this country, and they've perpetuated these crimes and violence, that they have the opportunity to go home to their own home country and face consequences there as well.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u00a0One of the most high profile examples of someone who's been rounded up by ICE in recent months is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and the fate of his situation is still up in the air. He's awaiting trial on human smuggling charges set for January in Tennessee, but your department is also working to get him deported to Uganda. If he broke the law in this country, as the administration alleges, shouldn't he be held here and face charges here instead of being deported?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Well, prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and in Pam Bondi's department, so we will let them do that. Although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him civilly as well, and the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn't walk free in the United States of America. This individual was a known human smuggler, MS-13 gang member, an individual who was a wife beater and someone who was so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors and even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off. He was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children, so he needs to never be in the United States of America, and our administration is making sure we're doing all that we can to bring him to justice.*",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But I heard you say that we're going to let the Justice Department do that. Does this mean that- does this mean that- does that mean the push to deport him to Uganda is off?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Oh, we will still continue to pursue all options. We will make sure that he's not released into this country. So regardless of that, yes, absolutely, he's not an American citizen, and he shouldn't be here, and especially because of his dangerous criminal activities, we should ensure that we leave every avenue on the table.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Got it. So, among other things, you oversee FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As we hit the peak of hurricane season, and we're marking the 20th anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina this weekend, 20 years ago. Is the federal government prepared to respond to a major disaster at this moment?",
      "SEC. NOEM: We are absolutely more prepared than the last administration and doing a much better job responding to the disasters we've already experienced since President Trump has been in the White House. We've had over a dozen, close to 20 different disasters throughout the country just since President Trump has been the president of the United States. And we have deployed resources twice as fast as FEMA ever has in the past, gotten people on the ground over 100% quicker than any other administration has. In fact, with the disasters that we saw that were so horrific and devastating in Texas and New Mexico, North Carolina, we've had people on the ground within hours responding to those families that were in crisis. So FEMA is consistently doing a much better job than it has in the past, and we're going to continue to stay on guard and make sure that we're there to always support these local states and these local emergency management directors in them being- getting the chance to run their disaster operations.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I bring this up because part of what you're suggesting there is in dispute from a handful of current and former FEMA employees who wrote to Congress this past week raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to forthcoming natural disasters. One of the specific concerns they have is this decision that now has you reviewing any cost of $100,000 or more that FEMA plans to make. Can you give me an example of a charge of $100,000 or more that you've rejected?",
      "SEC. NOEM: Yeah, absolutely. We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, to a one-woman firm to deliver to us 30 million meals, and she delivered only 50,000 to us. And it was a- one person that the st- federal government had contracted with in order to deliver 30 million, and I don't know how they ever expected one person to do that. We, we had a person that was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to book meetings that of less than 10 to 15 people, and with no meetings that we saw that were productive or couldn't be done by sending an email. Over and over again we're looking at these contracts and looking at the fact that, are they duplicative? Are they just supporting woke ideologies, DEI? Or are they actually delivering disaster response, which is what FEMA job is, is to put in place operations, to support states and local governments to take care of people. And so that evaluation has saved us hundreds of millions of dollars within FEMA and within the Department of Homeland Security, it has saved us $13 billion already. And we're going to consider- continue to make sure that we're accountable to taxpayers. You know, in Washington D.C., I rarely run into anybody who says I'm a lobbyist for the American taxpayer. Well, guess what, Kristi Noem is. Every day I get up and I think, the American people are paying for this, should they? And are these dollars doing what the law says they should be doing? I'm going to make sure that they go there and they're spent on what's appropriate according to the law, and that the taxpayers understand that it's a worthwhile effort.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: At least 20 of the people who signed this letter were current FEMA employees, and they've been placed on administrative leave. And I'd heard you in previous interviews suggest that those that are making accusations against the agency should put their names on the criticisms of the allegations. So now they have, and they've been placed on administrative leave. And I'm curious if it's now the policy of DHS that any time an employee puts their name on something publicly criticizes you or the President's leadership, that they should anticipate being put on leave or fired.",
      "SEC. NOEM: This- this letter was signed by many people anonymously. There was some who had their names on there. And those who had their names on there were temporary contract employees who had worked for the Department of Homeland Security for less than a year, individuals who are not long-term FEMA employees, who- who grab a hold of the mission to be there, to go and serve individuals and to- are deployed across the country, and have for years to make sure they're responsive to families in their time of need. So absolutely, every employee will be evaluated as to if they're doing their job and if they're doing it appropriately. And my hope is that every single person within the Department of Homeland Security, but also in this government, gets up every day wanting to make America safer, wanting to do their job and to contribute to that in a very productive way.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining us this Sunday from Florida. Thank you so much. Lots to discuss. We appreciate it.",
      "SEC. NOEM: Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.",
      "*Editor's note: Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been charged with two counts of human smuggling and has pleaded not guilty. He is currently in ICE detention pending trial. He has not been charged with any counts related to child abuse."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and KFF editor-at-large for public health, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 31, 2025.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're joined now by Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News Medical Contributor and the Editor at Large for Public Health at KFF Health News. Doctor, so great to see you. Thanks for coming to Washington for this important conversation. Because it's been a pretty chaotic week at the CDC, to say the least. We've seen the ouster of the head of the agency, who'd only been confirmed by the Senate this summer, she's now mounting a legal challenge to that. Other top officials also departed. They're still reeling from a shooting at the headquarters in Atlanta a few weeks ago. Why are these departures so important to take note of? And how do they affect you, me, and everybody else, in terms of health and medicine?DR. C\u00c9LINE GOUNDER: I think it's really important to understand that this is not just palace intrigue. This really does affect all of us. So not just the director, but the people in charge of respiratory infections, vaccine safety, the Chief Medical Officer, the person who was in charge of public health data also resigned earlier this week. So these are really key positions. Not to mention that a lot of the directors of the different centers, because it's centers plural, have also been forced out over the last several months. So you're really dealing with a leadership vacuum at the CDC. So, this is not business as usual. And so, specifically, how does this affect you and me, folks watching at home? So, first of all, vaccine policy. Vaccine policy is now being made by political fiat and communicated through social media, rather than a transparent, open, scientific review process. And so, we're seeing the reversal of previous recommendations, which will also confuse whether insurance will cover certain vaccines for certain people, and it's already sowing tremendous confusion at pharmacies, as well as doctor's offices.ED O'KEEFE: So, there is a series of meetings coming up regarding the future of vaccines and how they're going to be available, who gets them. Tell us about that and the concerns that some of these, now-former CDC officials had about what might happen at those meetings?DR. GOUNDER: Yeah. So these meetings are scheduled for mid-September. Some of the things on the agenda include the newborn Hepatitis B dose. We typically give it to newborns because that's to prevent transmission from the mother to the baby. So, that's one of the most common ways Hepatitis B is transmitted.ED O'KEEFE: One of the first shots a baby gets.DR. GOUNDER: One of the first shots it gets, for good reason. Also protection for infants, for RSV, one of the most common causes of hospitalization among infants. Number three, the COVID shots. And we expect to see a tightening of availability, eligibility of COVID shots, especially for healthy kids and adults. And then, finally, the combined measles, mumps, rubella varicella vaccine, and revisiting long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations would really be unprecedented, here.ED O'KEEFE: So, it's basically every shot you get from like 0 to 18 is now up for debate, and then the COVID shot, of course, which is an important one for many people on a regular, rolling basis?DR. GOUNDER:Yeah, some really basic things that we have counted on for a very long time. Some of the core concerns with the process involve cherry-picking of data, scientific reviews being altered or pulled, and unvetted studies being rushed into the process, into policy-making. And this is really an inversion of radical transparency.ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. There was a- there's an example in recent days, because there- is we're starting- fall is coming, COVID picks up. We've already seen one example of a school in Kansas City that was forced to shut down temporarily due to COVID, and there have been spikes in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, especially. What do people at home need to know as the fall approaches and COVID starts to spike?DR. GOUNDER: Well, I think, first of all, vaccinations are for many different purposes. So it's to prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. But, for a lot of people, you may not be able to call in sick from work very easily, like for us, it's really hard to take time off even if you really are sick. You might want to keep your kids in school, and so the best way to keep yourself at work or your kids in school is for them to get vaccinated so you and they are not getting sick.ED O'KEEFE: Let's- and we should point out, by the way, that school closed, set to open again on Tuesday, but the fact that they had to close at all, right, as the school year is beginning, is a sign, potentially, of things to come when people don't get their shots. Let's bottom line this. I'm a 42-year-old guy with asthma. Am I going to have issues getting my COVID shot?DR. GOUNDER: You will not, because- even though you're under 65. So the recommendations- or the FDA approval is for people 65 and older, they are all good. They can get their Covid shot. Under 65 if you have at least one risk factor for severe Covid, you can also get your Covid shot. So you can, absolutely. That's not an issue for you, Ed.ED O'KEEFE: But it's- you know, kids under 18, a perfectly healthy spouse, aging parents?--DR. GOUNDER: -- Yes, so aging parents over 65 they're eligible. But say you're between 6 months and 64 years of age and you do not have a risk factor for severe COVID. That is the group where we really have a lot of uncertainty. Now, I should point out, pregnancy is a risk factor for severe COVID. So your healthy wife, let's say she were pregnant, which I don't think she is, but if she were, she would be eligible for a COVID shot.ED O'KEEFE: All right. Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, we love having you to help us understand all this. We appreciate you coming down, good to see you. And we will be right back."

    "story": [
      "Climate activists smeared Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica with red and black paint on Sunday to express outrage at summer forest fires that have ravaged swaths of Spain, the Futuro Vegetal activist group said.",
      "In a video the group posted to social media, police officers are seen arresting two protesters as they shouted for \"climate justice.\"",
      "Activists said in the post's caption that their demonstration aimed to protest the government's \"complicity\" in the wildfires that scorched southern Spain's Iberian Peninsula. They also said roughly 70% of the country's wildfires are related to livestock farming, citing the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. CBS News wasn't able to independently confirm that statistic, but the Spanish government has held several meetings in recent weeks to respond to the blazes and address what the nation's leadership has called a \"climate emergency.\"",
      "The Sagrada Familia, designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, is one of Barcelona's main tourist attractions.",
      "Futuro Vegetal alleges that the Spanish government has taken insufficient action on climate change, notably to quell the recent clutch of fires that have caused extensive damage.",
      "The fires have left four people dead and ravaged some 870,00 acres of land in the past fortnight alone, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). More than 280 individual fires have burned nearly 1 million acres of land across Spain since the beginning of 2025, according to\u00a0EFFIS data, with the amount of acreage burned being much higher than in any other year of the last decade.",
      "Spain's government called the fires \"one of the biggest environmental catastrophes\" the country has witnessed in recent memory, and acknowledged a link with climate change. A major heat wave that struck Europe this summer fueled destructive wildfires in multiple countries, with Greece, France, Portugal and Turkey all contending with severe blazes, in addition to Spain.",
      "This weekend saw the scope of the problem recede in Spain, with civil protection services director Virginia Barcones saying Saturday that the emergency was \"coming to an end.\"",
      "Futuro Vegetal, which has links to similar groups abroad, has staged dozens of similar protests, including one in 2022 when they glued their hands to the frames of paintings by Spanish master Francisco de Goya at Madrid's Prado Museum.",
      "Paint was also thrown at a super yacht in Ibiza, reportedly belonging to Nancy Walton Laurie, the billionaire heiress of U.S. retail giant Walmart and a mansion of former FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi in Ibiza.",
      "Spanish police said last year they had arrested 22 members of Futuro Vegetal, including the two who took part in the Prado protest and the group's three main leaders.",
      "Some of the activist group's demonstration approaches have been reflected in climate protests elsewhere in Europe. In the United Kingdom, environmental activists were jailed last year for demonstrations that included splashing a van Gogh painting with soup. Other activists in the U.K. have splattered artworks with paint, sprayed buildings with fake blood and sprayed stones at Stonehenge with orange paint in efforts to raise awareness about climate change.",

      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",

      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",
      "Butler called the fossils an \"incredibly significant discovery,\" adding that \"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered.\"",
      "Butler's project co-leader, Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum in London, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

      "He said blue state senators will only greenlight \"Democrats or maybe weak Republicans.\" The president called on Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to abolish the practice, and he threatened to sue over it.",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for instance, has refused to give a blue slip to Clayton, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman.

      "There was plenty of disagreement as the DNC's Resolutions Committee considered two dueling resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The panel voted down a symbolic resolution calling for an arms embargo and suspension of U.S. military aid to Israel, which has long been the top American ally in the Middle East.",
      "A separate resolution introduced and supported by Martin that called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as well as unrestricted access to humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, was unanimously passed by the panel.",

Recent polling indicates support for Israel's continued military actions in Gaza is plummeting among Democrats.",
      "Democrats are aiming to rebound after last year's elections when the party lost control of the White House and the Senate. Democrats also fell short in their bid to win back the House majority, and Republicans made gains with voters who make up key parts of the Democratic Party's base.",
      "But the situation has only deteriorated for the Democrats in the 10 months since last year's election setbacks, according to key metrics.",
      "The Democrats' brand is deeply unpopular, especially with younger voters, and the party's poll numbers continue to drop to all-time lows in national surveys.",
      "The DNC continues to face a massive fundraising deficit at the hands of the rival Republican National Committee (RNC), as well as concerns over lagging party registration.",
      "But Martin was optimistic.",
      "While he acknowledged \"that our cash on hand seems to be low by comparison to the Republicans,\" he touted at Wednesday morning's Executive Committee meeting that \"we have raised $70 million so far this year, which is a record.\"",

      "After a rough stretch after winning election as DNC chair in February, Martin appears to have steadied himself this summer, and there was plenty of praise for the new chair during the meeting, which on Wednesday adjourned early after the deadly church shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis just a few miles from the DNC meeting.",

      "Why AI stuffed animals worry child experts",
      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people. Research already shows children ages 3 to 6 sometimes trust robots more than humans, even when the robots give wrong answers. That undermines how kids build empathy, learn to question, and develop critical thinking. There are also privacy concerns. Parents may not realize that these\u00a0\"personalized\" toys are recording conversations. Sensitive information could be stored, analyzed, or misused without families fully knowing.",

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",

      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",

      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",

We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",

Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address.

It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",

They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device.

      "Phishing scams are constantly evolving, and the DocuSign Apple Pay ruse is just one of many. The best defense is a healthy dose of skepticism. If something feels off, stop, double-check, and confirm directly through official channels. Scammers rely on panic and quick reactions.

      "Each time you enter your main email on a shopping site, you give that company a lasting way to connect your behavior across different platforms, devices and timeframes. They might hash or encrypt your email, but the behavioral patterns remain. You can still be tracked, but aliases interrupt that chain.",
      "Instead of sharing my actual email address, I create a unique one for each website. The emails still reach me through forwarding, but the company never sees my real address. That small change prevents them from linking my activity with other accounts or sites. It is not a perfect solution, but it adds just enough friction to disrupt the tracking systems.",
      "Every alias I use becomes a kind of tracker. If one starts getting spam, I know which site sold or lost my data. Most people don't know where the breach happened, they just assume \"it happens.\" I take a different approach. When an alias starts getting unwanted emails, I do not try to unsubscribe or set up filters or waste time guessing. I simply disable the alias, and the problem is gone.",

      "The average e-commerce site uses between 15 and 30 third-party scripts, analytics trackers, ad pixels and behavioral beacons, according to a study. Even if the site itself is honest, its stack probably isn't. Your email passes through layers of infrastructure, mailing tools, CRM platforms, shipping plugins. And all it takes is one misconfiguration or a careless developer for your data to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "An alias reduces the blast radius. If the site gets breached, your core identity remains untouched.",
      "Aliases don't just protect privacy, they improve behavior. When I started using them, I found myself thinking more clearly about where I was signing up and why. The mental pause required to generate a new alias made me more deliberate. And it gave structure to the mess. I could set rules like all product warranties going to products@myalias.com, all newsletters to news@myalias.com.",

Most people still rely on a single email address for everything, including shopping, banking, subscriptions, work and even family communication. That's not just inefficient but also a security risk.

If you're one of them, then the recent study by Microsoft will shed some light on how AI's generative capabilities will impact your field of work. In short, some occupations are more susceptible to its influence than others.",
      "This study is making waves because, unlike previous studies, it draws insight from real-world data. Microsoft looked at 200,000 anonymous Copilot conversations from 2024 and mapped them against the U.S. government's job classification system.",
      "The study also identified entire occupational groups, like \"computer and mathematical occupations\" and \"office and administrative support,\" among those with the highest AI overlap. The results reveal exactly which careers AI is already touching and which ones it barely affects.",

      "Is AI Going to Replace You?",
      "The result of the study was the calculation of an \"AI applicability score.\" It measures how closely certain job activities align with the capabilities of AI. To no one's surprise, knowledge-based and communication-heavy roles were at the top of the list of jobs that are most impacted. At the bottom of this list were jobs requiring physical labor or machine operation, showing minimal overlap.",

      "Why High AI Overlap Doesn't Always Mean Job Loss",
      "The researchers emphasized that it's important to differentiate between overlap and replacement. Overlap means the AI performs certain tasks alongside humans, while replacement means it will take their place. The study makes no predictions about job growth or losses. It's simply a snapshot of where AI fits in today. In fact, historical trends suggest that automation can sometimes add jobs instead of taking them away.

In early 2025, they turned to drone technology to renew the effort. Flying about 164 feet above the terrain, the drones surveyed a 452-acre section of the mountain. During the operation, they captured more than 2,600 high-resolution images. This aerial perspective revealed details in areas that would have been difficult and risky to reach on foot.",

      "How AI technology sped up the search",
      "Instead of relying on human experts to manually scan thousands of photos, AI software analyzed the entire dataset in just hours. Using color and shape recognition, the system highlighted objects that did not match the surrounding environment.",
      "One detection stood out: the red helmet belonging to the missing hiker. That small but critical find enabled rescuers to pinpoint the location and plan recovery efforts. Once the site was confirmed, teams navigated steep and unstable ground to reach the area. They worked in challenging alpine conditions to recover the hiker. Officials emphasized that this was a joint success between advanced technology and the skilled human team interpreting the AI's results.",

      "Similar AI-aided searches have been used in Canada, Switzerland, and the United States. These missions often deliver faster results than traditional methods.

    "story": [
      "Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that an FBI-warned scam is now using AI to target seniors.",
      "A tech leader like Google often seems invincible when it comes to cybersecurity attacks, but that is not the case. Earlier this month, the search giant confirmed that attackers had accessed one of its corporate Salesforce instances. According to a Google spokesperson, this system stored basic, and largely publicly available business information, such as contact details and notes from small and medium-sized companies. It did not store customer data from Google Cloud or consumer products like Gmail, Drive or Calendar.",
      "Google says it terminated the malicious activity, completed an impact analysis, and provided mitigations. Therefore, no further action is required by users.",

      "Cybercriminals are exploiting Google's recent Salesforce data breach to launch vishing calls and phishing attacks against Gmail users worldwide. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Vishing calls target Gmail users",
      "Hackers have reportedly accessed Google's Salesforce database systems, exposing customer and company names. Google confirmed the incident and clarified that the information was mostly public business contact data and did not include passwords or payment information. The company stressed that the breach affected only a corporate Salesforce system, not consumer Gmail or Google Cloud accounts.",
      "Still, attackers are exploiting the news of the breach to fuel phishing and vishing scams, tricking people into giving up sensitive information. According to PC World, some users have already reported an increase in phishing attempts that reference Google services.",
      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "One of the main tactics involves scam phone calls, also known as vishing. A Reddit post highlighted a wave of calls coming from the 650 area code, which is linked to Google's headquarters. In these calls, scammers pose as Google employees and warn victims of a supposed security breach. They then instruct users to reset their Gmail password and share it with them. This locks the rightful owner out of the account and gives the attacker complete control.",
      "A user launches Gmail. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Old infrastructure exploited with \"dangling buckets\"",
      "Separately from the Salesforce incident, Google Cloud customers are also facing another type of attack. Hackers are trying to exploit outdated access addresses using a method called the dangling bucket. This can allow them to inject malware or steal data. Both businesses and individuals are vulnerable to losing control over sensitive information if targeted in this way.",
      "Gmail and Google Cloud serve nearly 2.5 billion people, which makes the scale of the risk significant. Although the initial breach did not expose passwords, attackers are using the news of the incident to trick people into revealing their login details.",
      "A Google search window is on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Google accounts",
      "Google accounts are often a prime target for scammers. The good news is that protecting yourself doesn't require advanced technical skills. A few practical steps can drastically reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Phishing remains the most common way scammers steal Google account credentials. A fake email or text may claim your account has been locked or that you need to verify suspicious activity. Clicking the link usually takes you to a counterfeit login page that looks almost identical to the real Google sign-in screen.",
      "To avoid falling for these tricks, check the sender's email address carefully, hover over links before clicking, and avoid entering your Google password on any page that doesn't start with accounts.google.com.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Reusing weak passwords across multiple sites is an open invitation for scammers. If one site is breached, your Google account becomes vulnerable. A strong, unique password is your first line of defense.",
      "The easiest way to manage this is with a password manager. It can generate complex passwords, store them securely, and fill them in automatically when you need them. This way, you never have to remember dozens of different logins, and attackers can't guess their way in.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET A PASSWORD RESET EMAIL YOU DIDN\u2019T ASK FOR",
      "Scammers often use information they find online to craft convincing attacks. If your email address, phone number, or even past passwords are floating around on data broker sites, criminals have more tools to impersonate you or trick you into revealing more.",
      "Using a data removal service helps clean up your digital footprint. By reducing the amount of exposed information about you, it becomes much harder for scammers to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even the strongest password can be stolen, but\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra barrier. When enabled, Google will ask for a one-time code or prompt on your phone before granting access. That means even if a scammer manages to get your password, they can't log in without also having your device.",
      "Google offers several 2FA methods, from SMS codes to app-based prompts and even hardware security keys. For the best protection, choose app-based or hardware verification rather than text messages.",
      "Many scams rely on exploiting outdated software. If your phone, browser, or operating system isn't up to date, attackers may use known vulnerabilities to install malware or hijack your session.",
      "Set your devices to\u00a0update automatically whenever possible. This ensures you're always running the latest security patches, reducing the number of openings a scammer can use.",
      "Google provides built-in tools to help users spot suspicious activity. By visiting your Google Account's security page, you can see devices that have signed in, recent account activity, and whether recovery options like your phone number and backup email are up to date.",
      "Running a Google Security Checkup only takes a few minutes and gives you a clear overview of any weaknesses. Think of it as a health check for your digital life.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The incident is a reminder that even tech giants with vast resources are not immune to security lapses. While Google insists that no passwords were exposed, the wave of phishing and vishing scams shows how quickly criminals can weaponize even partial leaks. What began as a breach of business data has spiraled into a threat facing millions of everyday users, raising questions about how secure Google's ecosystem really is.",

For example, if you're on the phone with an airline, it can instantly display your flight details from Gmail. When you're in a group chat, it can surface photos or addresses without making you dig. And because all of this happens on-device, your personal data stays private.",
      "Pixel cameras are known for their quality, but Camera Coach takes it further. Using Gemini AI, it gives real-time tips to improve your photos. It might suggest a different angle, a tighter frame, or a better composition. For beginners, it's a helpful teacher. For experienced photographers, it's like having a second set of creative eyes right in your pocket.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:30:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, nonprofits like the Salvation Army continue long-term recovery efforts in New Orleans using community-focused disaster relief strategies.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "\u200b\u200bAs Hurricane Katrina ripped through the Gulf Coast in 2005, it reshaped the way nonprofits approach disaster relief, focusing on recovering the \"whole community.\"",
      "\"I think one of the things about long-term recovery is that you don't just build back the same way, but you build back smarter and stronger,\" said Jeff Jellets, emergency disaster services director for the Salvation Army's southern region.",
      "When Jellets first arrived in New Orleans, he saw piles of debris along the streets. The beach was empty. Not even the foundations of the beautiful homes that once stood along the shoreline were spared. All remaining evidence of life was stripped out piece by piece and taken to the sea.",
      "During the first few hours, he and his team were somewhat calm. \"We\u2019re going to be OK,\" Jellets thought to himself, but didn\u2019t foresee the monstrosity that Katrina would inevitably become.",
      "\"Then the levees obviously breached, and at that point, what was already a significant catastrophe just became much, much worse,\" he said.",
      "ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 29, 2005, HURRICANE KATRINA SLAMS GULF COAST, CAUSING MASSIVE DAMAGE",
      "A neighborhood in the Seventh Ward was severely flooded from Hurricane Katrina, Sept. 11, 2005, in New Orleans. (Lindsay Brice/Getty Images)",
      "At that moment, the Salvation Army, whose sole purpose is to protect those with no way out, became a victim of the storm, losing facilities in Pascagoula, Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi. But that didn't stop their efforts. According to\u00a0the Salvation Army's report in 2005, the organization served more than 4.7 million hot meals and 6.8 million sandwiches, snacks and drinks. They also offered emotional and spiritual support to nearly 103,000 people.",
      "Now, 20 years later, Jellets reflected on the improvements the Salvation Army has implemented post-Katrina, and on how the storm demonstrated the critical need to include nonprofits and community organizations in recovery efforts.",
      "Jellets outlined the three major operational changes the Salvation Army implemented post-Katrina: expanding feeding capabilities, pre-stocking of supplies and enhancing communications technology.",
      "\"We really expanded our mass-feeding footprint,\" he said. \"We changed the design of a lot of our vehicles to a more pickup truck-style that is a little more low profile, more durable and can get into some of those disaster areas.\"",
      "Leading up to Katrina, Jellets says a lot of the response was on-demand, locating supplies as needs came up. To combat that, they now have about 300,000 square feet of warehousing dedicated to disaster use. The shelves are lined with supplies.",
      "Neighborhoods in New Orleans are completely flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. (Michael Appleton/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)",
      "\"In our warehouses ahead of this hurricane season, we've got shelf-stable meals, we have cleanup kits, tarps, infant supply kits, and so we can access those critical supplies a lot faster,\" he said.",
      "In the aftermath of the storm, one of the biggest challenges they worked to overcome was the ability for survivors to communicate.",
      "\"It was a definite challenge very early on in Katrina,\" he said. \"We did a lot of health and welfare inquiries via amateur radio.\"",
      "Since then, the Salvation Army has utilized modern-day technologies for disaster relief.",
      "\"Our latest communication piece is to put satellite internet access on top of our feeding units,\" he said. \"So now when you get into the disaster area, if you turn on that satellite vision, get a clear view of the sky, not only can we talk to one another, but we can actually let survivors connect their phone to the internet and then tell their families, \u2018Hey, we're OK.\u2019\"",
      "It\u2019s not just about adopting new technologies. Katrina led to an important idea: the assumption of a \"whole community approach.\" These values, the response efforts already instilled in a community from before the storm hit and years beyond that, strengthen the community and build resilience. The coordination of nonprofits, like the Salvation Army, plays a huge part, as they were there before disaster struck.",

      "New Orleans residents are rescued from their rooftop after Hurricane Katrina hit, Aug. 29, 2005. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)",
      "\"The Salvation Army has not left New Orleans,\" said Meghan Foley, the Salvation Army\u2019s national director of emergency services. \"We're there for that long-term recovery, which two decades later is continuing, and we're continuing to build that community resilience day after day.\"",
      "Foley says she feels that each family they interact with is a step towards building community resilience in preparation for the next disaster. To her, if one more family is set with resources, that's one more family who can recover quickly and carry themselves through a potential disaster.",
      "\"You've got to manage expectations,\" Jellets said. \"To be so involved takes time, a 10-year plan where they not only rebuild homes but also learn the importance of rebuilding the intricate connections that make up a community.\"",
      "\"It showed us recovery can't just be about rebuilding structures, it has to be about rebuilding the lives and communities too,\" said Foley.",
      "After the Biloxi facility was destroyed, the Salvation Army knew it didn't have time to rebuild, so it continued operations out of a large tent, which included a field kitchen to provide meals.\u00a0Jellets\u00a0emphasizes that in cases like these, adaptability is key.",
      "Today, on that site stands a new Kroc Center, with a pool, recreation center and generators funded through a state hazard mitigation grant, allowing it to be a disaster relief shelter if need be.",
      "\"Building Back Stronger, I think, is one of the hallmarks of a good recovery piece,\" said Jellets.",
      "Since the Salvation Army operates in almost every ZIP code in the United States, they realize that every community is different, and the recovery process doesn\u2019t resemble a cookie-cutter model.",
      "\"If you're tied into the fabric of that community and understand what the economic and cultural nuances are, you're going to be much more in tune with what the priorities are in terms of the reconstruction and then the continual rebuild,\"\u00a0Jellets\u00a0said.",

      "Jellets\u00a0told Fox News Digital that what they've developed over time is their goal, not just to help them through the immediate storm, but to provide other underlying social service issues as well.",
      "The New Orleans Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center was heavily damaged. To Foley and\u00a0Jellets, part of the long-term recovery is providing people with the tools they need to not only survive, but to live.",
      "Working on these issues allows the Salvation Army and other nonprofits to not fixate on immediate needs, but on important social service needs that can be exacerbated by disasters.",
      "In another instance,\u00a0Jellets recalled an elderly lady they had helped by reconstructing her house in the early days of Katrina\u2019s aftermath.\u00a0Jellets, happy he thought his work was done, asked the woman how she felt.",
      "\"If you could change something, what would you like to change? And she said, 'I really wish I had neighbors.'\"",
      "Most of the young professionals moved away with their families. She had little interaction with anyone. To see that lady still upset after having a new house was a turning point for\u00a0Jellets. A house can only get you so far,\u00a0making him realize the value of community solidarity.",
      "\"You have to help the community,\" he said. \"We look at responses since then to Hurricane Ian, or even now, what we're doing with\u00a0Helene is trying to be inclusive and bring back the community as a whole. Because if you don't, it doesn't rebound.\""

      "\"I urge Iranian leaders to take the immediate steps necessary to ensure that their nation will never obtain a nuclear weapon; to walk the path of peace; and to, by extension, advance prosperity for the Iranian people,\" he added.",

      "According to a U.K. official on Thursday, the decision to enforce snapback sanctions, which is expected to have severe consequences for Iran's already flagging economy, was not a decision that was made \"lightly.\"",
      "The official confirmed that there has been \"very intense diplomacy\" over the last \"12-months, 6-months, 6-weeks\" that ultimately led to this decision \u2013 including three major factors like Tehran's uranium stockpile levels, its operating of advanced centrifuges and its refusal to adhere to international inspection regulations \u2013 all of which are dictated under the JCPOA.",
      "The official confirmed that in May Iran was found to have roughly 20,000 pounds of enriched uranium, including 900 pounds of near-weapons grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) \u2013 which is 45 times higher than the JCPOA limit of under 660 pounds of enriched uranium.",

      "But Grossi also noted that it would be \"almost impossible\" for Iran to get to a point of compliance with the JCPOA due to too many technical advances.",
      "Questions over the location of the HEU, which is estimated to be enough to make 10 nuclear warheads, mounted after the U.S. levied direct strikes at Iran\u2019s nuclear program in June. Reports suggested that in the days leading up to the strikes, Iran may have moved and hidden some of its uranium based on satellite imagery that showed convoys leaving the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites.",
      "But on Wednesday, Grossi countered these concerns and said the IAEA had no evidence that the uranium has been moved to a secret location.",
      "Though the stockpile of HEU is still not officially accounted for as the IAEA has not been granted access to Iran's top nuclear sites, Grossi said he anticipated that access to come shortly as inspectors on Wednesday visited the Bushehr nuclear power plant after being re-granted access in Iran.",
      "When asked by reporters whether Iran was taking immediate action to begin meeting the E3 demands and avoid sanctions, Grossi said, \"point blank\u2026 no.\"",

      "Hours later, Monarez was out, according to a Health and Human Services post on X. Almost immediately, several top officials resigned in protest.",

      "In an email to NBC News, one of Monarez\u2019s lawyers, Mark Zaid, said that Monarez was in Washington, D.C., at the time the Department of Health and Human Services announced her firing. Zaid declined to share details on what led up to HHS announcing her firing. He maintains that she \u201cremains\u201d director because the only person with the authority to fire her is President Donald Trump.",

      "Weston\u2019s father, Grant Halsne, told NBC News that the fragment came close to \u2014 but didn\u2019t hit \u2014 the 10-year-old\u2019s carotid artery, which a doctor described as a \u201cmiracle.\u201d",

      "\"To me, it still doesn't register,\" he said. \"It doesn't feel real.\"",
      "On Sunday, Minneapolis police revised the number of people injured in the shooting from 18 to 21, adding three injured children to the count. It was not immediately clear whether Weston was included in that new total.",
      "The suspect was found dead at the rear of the church with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to search warrants. She was found dressed in black \u201ctactical\u201d gear and officials found approximately 120 shell casings from three different guns that she used, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara.",
      "The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.",

      "The move, which alarmed the agency\u2019s workforce, sources said, is the latest example of simmering tensions and crossed signals between Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The two have clashed previously over her decisions, including this month when Gabbard declassified a lightly redacted document related to Russian election interference.",

Gabbard fell out of favor with Trump and his aides this year when she posted a video and delivered testimony about Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities.",

      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard blindsided CIA leaders last week when she disclosed the name of an undercover CIA officer on a list of people she stripped of security clearances, multiple current and former intelligence sources said.",
      "The move, which alarmed the agency\u2019s workforce, sources said, is the latest example of simmering tensions and crossed signals between Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The two have clashed previously over her decisions, including this month when Gabbard declassified a lightly redacted document related to Russian election interference.",
      "Two former government officials said their read of the situation is that Gabbard is under pressure to regain President Donald Trump\u2019s confidence. Gabbard fell out of favor with Trump and his aides this year when she posted a video and delivered testimony about Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities.",
      "But the tensions seem to have subsided for now. On Tuesday, as he presided over a Cabinet meeting before television cameras, Trump praised Gabbard. \u201cYou found some interesting things, Tulsi,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s becoming a bigger and bigger star every day.\u201d",

      "Voter turnout by mail exceeded 30% in at least 14 states and the District of Columbia, according to the most recent data available. Trump won half of those states, most of which have Republican governors or secretaries of state overseeing elections. Others, like Arizona and Michigan, have Democrats overseeing elections but are major electoral battlegrounds.",
      "Michigan state House Majority Leader Bryan Posthumus, a Republican who endorsed Trump last year, is among those with concerns over calls to scrap mail-in voting, though he has proposed amending the state constitution to require proof of citizenship to register to vote and a photo ID to cast a ballot.",
      "In South Dakota, a state with high vote-by-mail turnout, GOP Chair Jim Eschenbaum expressed concern that a ban could unfairly disenfranchise military personnel.",
      "\u201cIf anybody deserves a vote in our elections, it\u2019s the people that are willing to die for us,\u201d Eschenbaum said. \u201cSo we can\u2019t ban it, but I think it should be limited in the respect that it is somewhat ripe for fraud.\u201d",

      "Khanna was referring to President Richard Nixon\u2019s pressuring the Fed chair to keep interest rates lower before the 1972 election, which Nixon won. He resigned two years later because of the Watergate scandal.",

      "A man was found dead Saturday in a suspected homicide at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert.",
      "The man, described as a white adult, was found \u201clying on the ground\u201d and deceased after 9 p.m. on Saturday, the Pershing County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Sunday.",
      "The discovery was made while the \u201cMan,\u201d a large human-shaped wooden sculpture at the center of the festival in Black Rock City, was engulfed in flames. A participant flagged down a sheriff\u2019s deputy and reported seeing \u201ca male subject lying in a pool of blood,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "Deputies, along with Bureau Land Management rangers and Burning Man Black Rock rangers, created a perimeter around the area and interviewed participants.",
      "Officials said the identity of the man is unknown, and the body has been transported to the Washoe County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.",
      "\u201cAlthough this act appears to be a singular crime, all participants should always be vigilant of their surroundings and acquaintances,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "Law enforcement is preserving the crime scene, noting the case is a \u201ccomplicated investigation,\u201d as the makeshift city will be gone by the middle of the week. The annual festival kicked off Aug. 24 and ends Monday.",
      "Anyone with information regarding the homicide is asked to contact the sheriff\u2019s office.",
      "Burning Man said in a statement it is cooperating with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf you are in Black Rock City, do not interfere with law enforcement activity,\u201d the festival said. \u201cThe safety and well-being of our community are paramount.\u201d",
      "The festival said Black Rock rangers can offer peer support services at the ranger headquarters and outposts, and Black Rock City\u2019s Emergency Services Department\u2019s crisis support team is available 24/7 at stations.",
      "Last week at the festival, which attracts tens of thousands of people from across the country, a woman \u201cspontaneously\u201d gave birth in an RV camper to her and her husband\u2019s first child.",
      "The baby was born Aug. 27. Mother Kayla Thompson told The New York Times she was asleep in the camper when she started experiencing a lot of \u201cpain\u201d and minutes later gave birth to a 3-pound, 9-ounce baby girl.",
      "She said she didn\u2019t appear pregnant and \u201cdidn\u2019t have any symptoms\u201d of pregnancy.",
      "\u201cEven the nurses at the hospital were like, \u2018You don\u2019t look like you were pregnant at all,\u2019\u201d she told the publication."

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Sunday that the Trump administration plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in major cities, including Chicago.",
      "Asked about plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago specifically, Noem told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we\u2019re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations.\u201d",
      "Asked about what an expansion of ICE operations would look like in Chicago and whether it would involve a mobilization of National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and arrests, Noem demurred, saying, \u201cThat always is a prerogative of President [Donald] Trump and his decision. I won\u2019t speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities.\u201d",
      "Her remarks come one day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing his city\u2019s legal department to explore ways to counter a potential surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Illinois.",
      "During a press conference Saturday, Johnson warned that Chicago officials had \u201creceived credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our cities see some type of militarized activity by the federal government.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration directed federal law enforcement officers, including those employed by ICE, to assist police in Washington, D.C., with crime-fighting operations. That surge of resources included thousands of National Guard troops who were deployed to the nation\u2019s capital with the stated goal of lowering crime rates.",
      "Following the movement of troops and law enforcement officers to Washington, Trump threatened to send federal officers and troops to other major American cities, including Baltimore.",
      "Later in the Sunday interview, Noem was asked whether Boston would be one of the cities where the federal government would surge immigration enforcement agents.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now, and so we haven\u2019t taken anything off the table,\u201d she said, adding later: \u201cI\u2019d encourage every single big city \u2014 San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are \u2014 if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom like the people of Washington, D.C., are now ... they should call us.\u201d",
      "Other Democratic officials, including a group of over a dozen governors, have condemned plans to deploy troops to their states.",
      "In a statement last week, they said, \u201cWhether it\u2019s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the President\u2019s threats and efforts to deploy a state\u2019s National Guard without the request and consent of that state\u2019s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members.\u201d",
      "And in an interview that aired Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want troops on the streets of American cities. That\u2019s un-American. Frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better.\u201d",
      "Pritzker also accused the Trump administration of targeting states run by Democrats rather than those run by Republicans, telling CBS, \u201cNotice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states. ... Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places, and we\u2019re very proud of the work that we\u2019ve done.\u201d",
      "Asked whether there are plans in place to deploy troops and federal law enforcement officials to states and cities run by Republicans, Noem said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we\u2019ve got operations that, again, I won\u2019t talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we\u2019re doing with a political lens,\u201d she added."

    "story": [
      "Jeremy Lin is ready to let the final buzzer sound on a remarkable 15-year basketball career that captured headlines across the globe and for a few weeks in 2012 made New York City the epicenter of the basketball universe.",
      "The NBA icon announced his retirement in an Instagram post Saturday, writing that although he knew the end would come, it was the \u201chardest decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been the honor of a lifetime to compete against the fiercest competitors under the brightest lights and to challenge what the world thought was possible for someone who looks like me,\u201d Lin, 37, wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve lived out my wildest childhood dreams to play in front of fans all around the world. I will forever be the kid who felt fully alive every time I touched a basketball.\u201d",
      "Lin\u2019s career caught fire when he led the New York Knicks to a seven-game winning streak in 2012, his first year as a point guard in the team\u2019s starting lineup. \u201cLinsanity\u201d overtook the Big Apple as his performance propelled the Knicks to the 2012 playoffs and turned him into an international phenomenon.",
      "In the wake of his breakout stardom, Lin, then 23, appeared on the covers of Sports Illustrated (for two consecutive weeks) and Time magazine, which named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s dispelled the idea that Asian-American guards somehow couldn\u2019t hack it in the NBA \u2014 and that being a world-class athlete on the court is somehow at odds with being an excellent student off the court,\u201d Time wrote of his success.",
      "Lin defied stereotypes as the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to make it to the NBA. By the time he graduated from Harvard University in 2010, the Taiwanese American athlete had become the first player in Ivy League history to record at least 1,450 points throughout his college career.",
      "After graduation, Lin was passed over for the NBA draft in 2010 before signing with his hometown Golden State Warriors as a free agent. After being cut by both the Warriors and the Houston Rockets in 2011, Lin signed with the Knicks at the end of the year.",
      "For the first few weeks of 2012, Lin spent most of his games warming the bench. It wasn\u2019t until February that he was given a chance on the court to turn around an abysmal season for the team.",
      "At the height of his \u201cLinsanity\u201d run, he stoked even more audience fervor when he hit a winning 3-pointer against the Toronto Raptors with less than a second left on the clock. Lin also became the first NBA player to score at least 20 points and dole out seven assists in each of his first five starts.",
      "Lin continued his NBA career with stints on the Rockets, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Raptors, among others. While with the Raptors in 2019, he became the first Asian American player to win an NBA championship.",
      "He later took his basketball career across the Pacific to China\u2019s Beijing Ducks and Guangzhou Loong Lions, as well as Taiwan\u2019s Kaohsiung Steelers and New Taipei Kings, where he ended his career this year as MVP of the Taiwan Professional Basketball League.",
      "\u201cSo many people have sacrificed and poured into my journey, more than I could ever repay. Thank you all for believing in me, for walking with me, for celebrating my highs and picking me up in my lows,\u201d Lin wrote in his retirement post. \u201cThis is a ride I never wanted to end but I know it\u2019s time. I will forever miss playing basketball in front of you all but our time will go beyond just playing. Here\u2019s to what\u2019s ahead.\u201d"

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Doctors discovered a bullet fragment in the neck of a 10-year-old boy who went viral for recounting how his friend jumped on top of him to shield him during a mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis that killed two children and injured others.",
      "Weston Halsne, a fifth-grade student at Annunciation Catholic School, was attending Mass on Wednesday when the shooting occurred. He recounted running under a pew and covering his head while shots came through the stained-glass windows, and said his friend Victor was shot while shielding him.",
      "\u201cI think I got, like, gunpowder on my neck,\u201d he said after the shooting.",
      "But doctors later discovered it was not just gunpowder that hit the 10-year-old\u2019s neck, but a bullet fragment as well.",
      "Weston\u2019s father, Grant Halsne, told NBC News that the fragment came close to \u2014 but didn\u2019t hit \u2014 the 10-year-old\u2019s carotid artery, which a doctor described as a \u201cmiracle.\u201d",

      "Grant Halsne said the shooting has left his son scared and not wanting to be alone.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s scared of loud noises,\u201d the father said.",
      "On Wednesday just before 8:30 a.m., 23-year-old Robin Westman fired a rifle through the side windows of Annunciation Catholic School\u2019s church, aiming at children sitting in the pews.",
      "Weston remembered thinking, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d when he heard the first gunshot. When he heard it again, he ran under the pew.",
      "The student had practiced what to do during an active shooter situation, but never at the church, he said.",
      "\u201cI was like two seats away from the stained glass windows,\u201d Weston said. \u201cSo, they were like, the shots were like right next to me.\u201d",
      "Grant Halsne said he still hasn't processed that his son was shot during Mass.",
      "\"To me, it still doesn't register,\" he said. \"It doesn't feel real.\"",
      "On Sunday, Minneapolis police revised the number of people injured in the shooting from 18 to 21, adding three injured children to the count. It was not immediately clear whether Weston was included in that new total.",
      "The suspect was found dead at the rear of the church with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to search warrants. She was found dressed in black \u201ctactical\u201d gear and officials found approximately 120 shell casings from three different guns that she used, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara.",

      "The comments come just days after the Trump administration fired the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, triggering an exodus of senior CDC officials from the agency.",
      "Asked the first time whether he has 100% confidence in Kennedy, whom he voted to confirm, Lankford demurred, telling NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Kennedy isn\u2019t limiting access to the Covid vaccine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still widely accepted,\u201d Lankford said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is, is it right for children to be able to have the Covid vaccine? That\u2019s been a conversation where doctors widely disagree on this,\u201d he added, before encouraging Americans to get their flu vaccines.",
      "Asked a second time about whether he has 100% confidence in Kennedy, Lankford told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker, \u201cI believe he is who the president has picked. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gone a wrong direction in this.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported last week that former CDC Director Susan Monarez\u2019s ouster came after she refused to sign off on vaccine guidance that contained anti-vaccine talking points. Kennedy is a longtime anti-vaccine activist.",
      "Shortly after Monarez was fired, several other top CDC officials resigned, including Dr. Debra Houry, the chief medical officer; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Jen Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology.",
      "Since taking his post earlier this year, Kennedy has already drastically reshaped the top federal health agency\u2019s outlook on vaccines.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and replaced them with his own appointees. Shortly after, the panel received a presentation from an anti-vaccine activist featuring claims that have been widely debunked by scientists.",
      "On Sunday, Lankford claimed that Kennedy\u2019s actions were just \u201cpushing the boundaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he is challenging some of the assumptions that a lot of Americans have asked,\u201d the senator said. \u201cWhat is it about our food? What is it about autism? What is it about all these things that are different in America than they are in different places? I think those are appropriate questions.\u201d",
      "\u201c[Kennedy is] pushing the boundaries, but he also seems to be following the science. It\u2019s not wrong to be able to ask hard questions. It is wrong to ignore the science. I don\u2019t see him ignoring the science. I see him asking the hard questions,\u201d the Oklahoma senator said.",
      "He later clarified that he does not believe the widely debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, telling Welker, \u201cI don\u2019t connect those two at all, but there are reasonable questions to say, Why do we have more cases of autism here? What is it? But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re connected to vaccines.\u201d",
      "Lankford on Sunday also spoke about an appeals court\u2019s decision late Friday that concluded that President Donald Trump had misused his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs on foreign nations without Congress\u2019 approval.",
      "The senator praised Trump\u2019s work on the tariffs in recent months, saying that the president is \u201caccomplishing\u201d his economic goals with tariffs.",
      "\u201cFor the court to step in and say he doesn\u2019t have the ability to be able to regulate trade \u2014 that is within the statute,\u201d Lankford said, acknowledging that the Trump administration is planning to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.",
      "He also blamed court decisions like this one for causing instability for retailers as they plan their imports and set prices.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing, Kristen, more than anything else, from all the companies that I talked to, is they just wanted to be set. They just want to know what the rules of the road are,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a new court hearing, every time there\u2019s a new change, it\u2019s destabilizing for every one of our businesses. So let\u2019s get all these things resolved as quickly as we possibly can.\u201d",
      "The senator also called for the Federal Reserve to remain independent from the whims of the executive branch, but emphasized that the Fed is part of a collaborative approach to the economy, along with the president and Congress.",
      "\u201cThe president has a role, as he\u2019s doing with tariffs in multiple different ways, to be able to negotiate more deals. The Federal Reserve also has a role in this. So all of us have a role in it. We just have a different role,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is at its best when it\u2019s independent, but they\u2019re not independent of the entire American people.\u201d",
      "Lankford also expressed support for the president\u2019s decision to send National Guard troops and federal law enforcement to Washington, D.C., earlier this month in what Trump has called an effort to curb crime.",
      "Lankford said that other cities and jurisdictions, including in his home state of Oklahoma, should invite federal law enforcement to help lower crime rates in their towns as well.",

      "\u201cI would say the people of Oklahoma would welcome any help that we can get to be able to deal with criminal issues,\u201d Lankford added, saying that other cities, like Chicago, \u201cshould be asking for help rather than pushing help away.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said that Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook should release her mortgage documents but accused President Donald Trump of \u201cfollowing Richard Nixon\u2019s playbook to interfere with\u201d the Federal Reserve.",
      "Khanna\u2019s comments in a Sunday interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d come after Trump moved to fire Cook on Monday, pointing to allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook is challenging the move in a lawsuit.",
      "The lawmaker was referring to President Richard Nixon pressuring the then-Fed chair to keep interest rates lower before the 1972 election, which Nixon won before resigning two years later because of the Watergate scandal.",
      "Decades later, Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Cook marked an extraordinary move to exert control over an independent agency, a move that Democrats have painted as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and a \u201cpower grab,\u201d while Trump accused Cook of \u201cdeceitful and potentially criminal conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe should be transparent,\u201d Khanna said, responding to a question about whether Cook should release her mortgage documents to dispute the allegations. \u201cBut this has nothing to do with the specifics of Lisa Cook. This has to do with Donald Trump following Richard Nixon\u2019s playbook to interfere with the Fed and bully the Fed.\u201d",
      "He argued that Trump\u2019s tariff policies were standing in the way of the Federal Reserve lowering rates, as Trump has pushed for.",
      "\u201cThe irony is that it\u2019s his own policies that have created the situation,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIf he just repealed the blanket tariffs, he wouldn\u2019t be putting the inflationary pressure that exists, and the Fed would be able to cut rates.\u201d",
      "Asked again whether Cook should release her mortgage documents to combat allegations of fraud, Khanna agreed.",
      "\u201cWell, sure she should release them,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cShe\u2019s should be transparent so that we see that this is just a political football.\u201d",
      "Cook sued Trump on Thursday, arguing his attempt to fire her was \u201cunlawful and void.\u201d Lawyers for Cook and the White House appeared before a judge one day later, though the judge ultimately did not rule on Cook\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order to prevent her from being fired while the case proceeds.",
      "The president has been vocally pushing for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, frequently berating Chair Jerome Powell. The Federal Reserve is set to meet in September to determine whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Trump\u2019s criticism of Cook began after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte filed a criminal referral against Cook, accusing her of putting false information on mortgage applications before joining the Fed. Pulte filed a second criminal referral last week, accusing her of misrepresenting another property on a mortgage document. Cook\u2019s lawyer hit back, calling the referral \u201can obvious smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Khanna\u2019s comments come days before Congress is set to return from August recess, gearing up for another high-stakes showdown over files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., are co-sponsoring a bill to make the Trump administration release \u201call unclassified records\u201d on Epstein. The fight over Epstein roiled Congress so forcefully this summer that House Speaker Mike Johnson began summer recess one day early after Democrats planned to force votes related to Epstein.",
      "The bipartisan duo also plans to host a press conference on Wednesday with \u201csurvivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s abuse,\u201d according to the press release.",
      "Khanna said Sunday that he is \u201cvery confident\u201d his and Massie\u2019s bill will pass. The congressman said that the Wednesday press conference \u201cwill be explosive,\u201d adding that \u201cmany\u201d of the speakers have not spoken publicly about their experiences before.",
      "\u201cThey will be telling their story, and they will be saying clearly to the American public that they want the release of the Epstein files for full closure on this matter,\u201d Khanna said."

    "summary": "Nearly two months after the tragic July 4 floods in Texas that killed more than 130 people, Rep.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly two months after the tragic July 4 floods in Texas that killed more than 130 people, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said he\u2019s still seeking answers to some of the most basic questions about the federal government\u2019s response.",
      "Which emergency officials did the National Weather Service call on the night of the flooding? How exactly did the agency staff up for the storm event? How did vacancies in key positions at the local National Weather Service office, such as the warning coordination meteorologist, affect the outcome?",
      "In four letters to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and in a fifth to the Department of Commerce, the Austin congressman has demanded records that would help tell the story of July 4.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never received a written response,\u201d said Doggett, who is accusing the agencies of stonewalling his inquiries.",
      "The congressman\u2019s push for records highlights gaps in the public accounting of what happened that day. In the immediate aftermath of the flooding, independent meteorologists said the National Weather Service issued timely warnings and that its forecasts were solid, given the limits of modern forecasting technology during flash flood events.",
      "What was less clear then \u2014 and remains so as of late August \u2014 was how effectively the agency was able to reach emergency managers and other stakeholders on the ground when the risk to specific locations became apparent. Reaching the \u201clast mile\u201d is something former NWS meteorologists have said suffers when forecasting offices are short on staff or overworked.",
      "\u201cIf they have nothing to hide and the Trump slash-and-burn approach to the weather service did not have any impact here, they need to produce the logs,\u201d Doggett said, referring to the records he has been seeking. \u201cGetting public attention on it is perhaps the only way to get the administration to respond.\u201d",
      "Neither NOAA nor the Commerce Department responded to requests for comment.",
      "Doggett sent his first letter to NOAA on May 20, before the flooding. In the letter, which was addressed to acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm, Doggett shared concerns about the vacancy rate in the Austin/San Antonio weather forecasting office. That office oversaw forecasting and communication in the areas hit hard by the July storms.",
      "\u201cA 22% vacancy rate at the local NWS jeopardizes the timeliness of forecasts and warnings on which the community relies,\u201d Doggett wrote, asking how the agency would cope with the staff shortages and if it planned to fill any of the office\u2019s roles.",
      "After the flood disaster, Doggett followed up with NOAA on July 8 with 15 additional questions about the agency\u2019s response. Doggett said he received a videoconference meeting on July 11 with Ken Graham, the agency\u2019s director.",
      "In a letter sent after the meeting on July 11, and again in a July 24 follow-up, Doggett requested the agency provide call logs, chat logs, radar archives and shift logs, among other records.",
      "\u201cHe said that stuff was easy to provide,\u201d Doggett said, relaying his memory of Graham\u2019s comments during their Zoom meeting. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking about it ever since and there\u2019s no good explanation.\u201d",
      "Executive branch agencies are allowed to respond at their discretion to individual members of Congress conducting oversight, according to the Department of Justice\u2019s interpretation of the law. But executive agencies often voluntarily accommodate congressional requests.",
      "Doggett said he\u2019s hounded NOAA with calls and texts, and in an Aug. 27 letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Doggett accused the Commerce Department of stifling a response he believed was prepared by NOAA to address his questions.",
      "\u201cI have been advised that answers to my inquiries have been prepared, but that these are being withheld by your office,\u201d Doggett wrote. \u201cWe have no evidence of the NWS\u2019s preparation, communication, and response \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 related to the July 4 flood. The refusal to provide a complete, timely response, suggests the Administration has something to hide concerning its handling of this tragedy.\u201d",
      "Doggett said four children from Austin were killed in the floods and called for an investigation of the tragedy similar to those performed by the National Transportation Safety Board after major disasters, an idea that has drawn bipartisan support.",
      "\u201cIf this had been 27 children being lost in a plane crash, we would have NTSB doing a thorough investigation of every aspect of state, federal and local [actions],\u201d Doggett said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any indication of a thorough evaluation of what did and didn\u2019t happen at the federal level.\u201d",
      "NBC News has filed several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with NOAA, seeking records from the NWS. Some of these requests could turn up records with answers to Doggett\u2019s questions, but they have yet to be fulfilled.",
      "One of the requests, for chat logs and communications between forecasters, was listed as \u201cassigned for processing,\u201d according to the Commerce Department\u2019s public records website. The agency said another request \u2014 for information about staffing and job cuts \u2014 would be processed in batches and released publicly along with other similar requests about the Texas floods.",
      "\u201cWe are working to provide an interim release by the beginning of September, with ongoing releases through the end of the year,\u201d Julia Swanson, the agency\u2019s FOIA coordinatorc wrote in an Aug. 18 status update. \u201cTo focus our limited staff resources effectively, all other FOIA requests have been temporarily tabled so that the NWS FOIA team can focus on processing Texas flooding requests.\u201d"

      "Carstens, a longtime freelancer based in Spain, spends a good portion of her day working with startups and individual clients looking to fix their botched attempts at artificial intelligence-generated logos.",
      "The illustrations clients bring to her are commonly littered with unclean lines and nonsensical text, and they look like a mess of pixels when blown up beyond a certain size.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s people that are aware AI isn\u2019t perfect, and then there\u2019s people that come to you angry because they didn\u2019t manage to get it done themselves with AI,\u201d Carstens said. \u201cAnd you kind of have to be empathetic. You don\u2019t want them to feel like idiots. Then you have to fix it.\u201d",

      "Country music singer Bryan Martin is speaking out after he was \u201cforcibly\u201d removed from the stage during a concert in upstate New York.",
      "On Aug. 29, Martin was performing for fans at the Schaghticoke Fairgrounds, located about 30 minutes from Albany, when local authorities had to escort him out of the venue mid-performance. The Rensselaer County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement the singer \"displayed signs of intoxication and erratic behavior, which ultimately required him to be removed from the stage.\"",
      "\u201cDeputies and event staff attempted to assist Mr. Martin offstage, but due to his impaired state, he became resistant and had to be forcibly escorted out,\" read the statement, which was shared to Facebook Aug. 30.",
      "After the concert, Martin apologized to his fans in a message shared to social media.",
      "\u201cSorry I let yall down tonight\u2026 truth is I\u2019m not ok\u2026\u201d Martin began. \u201cBeen hitting it hard for a while and haven\u2019t took time to be honest with myself about my mental health and it\u2019s nothing new to struggle with my anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cBut I\u2019ve had a weight on my heart lately that\u2019s Been heavy and accumulating with time and I let myself and my fans down by not addressing them and getting help and pretending it was all gonna just go away.\u201d",
      "Martin said he recognizes that being a musician won\u2019t get any easier. He also added that he misses his children and family when he is on the road.",
      "Speaking about his behavior during his latest concert, he shared, \u201cLately I\u2019ve learned I let my fragile mind override my heart at times and tonight it got the best of me\u2026 I apologize for the bad days\u2026 but I\u2019m grateful for the countless good nights we\u2019ve shared this year.\u201d",
      "He said he will lean on his faith as he looks to prioritize his health. While he still plans to work on his music, Martin said he will take a step back to focus on writing songs and getting the help he needs.",
      "\u201c\u2019I\u2019m not ever proud when I reach for another drink\u2026hope yall can find it in you to forgive me and hope I can be a better version of myself with some prayer and love,\u201d he told his fans. \u201cAnd I appreciate yall believing in a broken old soul like me.\u201d",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office attached Martin\u2019s post to its statement and reflected on learning of his battle with alcoholism.",

      "The Sphere even took the experience outside the physical venue \u2014 and up to the Las Vegas sky.",
      "Mimicking the Wicked Witch of the West writing a message to Dorothy using smoke in the sky, the Sphere shared an image of the line \u201cSURRENDER DOROTHY...OR DIE\u201d penned in puffs over the venue.",
      "Changes to \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019",
      "The Sphere experience also made some notable changes to play the film on its wraparound screen.",
      "First, the runtime. While \"The Wizard of Oz\" typically clocks in at around 102 minutes, the runtime for the Sphere show is 75 minutes.",
      "Then, there's the score. While the audience will hear Judy Garland\u2019s original vocals as Dorothy, the Sphere\u2019s version includes a re-recorded rendition of the original movie score for \u201cnew clarity.\u201d Sphere Studios separated the vocals from the instrumentals in the original tracks and used an orchestra to record a more detailed variation of the score, according to a video on the venue's official YouTube page.",
      "According to the Sphere, the new score transforms the original versions of songs like \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d into music better fit for the venue\u2019s 167,000 programmable speakers built into the seats.",
      "\u201cYou can actually feel the voice and effects,\u201d Carolyn Blackwood, head of Sphere Studios, said in the video. \u201cAnd with the 4D, you feel like you\u2019re there.\u201d",
      "The experience\u2019s producer, Jane Rosenthal, said in a video that their goal is to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the original filmmakers\u2019 intent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of our cultural history,\u201d Rosenthal added. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take it and do anything with it.\u201d",
      "The film was originally shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the Sphere's screen is not a flat rectangle. To adapt the classic film, the team used artificial intelligence to make it fit the massive display and improve the resolution. Visual effects specialists took the original sets and \u201cextended them realistically beyond that based on the production design,\u201d producer and CEO of software design company Magnopus Ben Grossmann said in a video about the experience.",
      "He explained that, working with a team at Google, they broke down the original \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d frame by frame using super resolution, pinpointing how to enhance the 1930s shots.",
      "For example, several shots solely show a character from their waist to the top of their head. The team used character outpainting to restore the shots and transform into the large displays for the Sphere.",
      "Similarly, some of the original closeup shots with minimal background details are now wider shots, meaning they must show more of the set and additional characters. The team used \"performance generation\" technology to illustrate what characters could have been doing in the background.",
      "The use of AI for the project has come with some controversy. Some described the alteration of the original work as an offense to cinema.",
      "\u201chonestly this is the ugliest and most dishonorable thing to happen to classic cinema in years,\u201d one social media user said on X.",
      "A recent Variety review of the showing called the effects, \u201ccreepy, applied over existing footage in a way that clearly interferes with the humanity of the underlying performances \u2014 that is, if there was an underlying performance to begin with.\u201d",
      "USA Today, however, dubbed the show \"nothing short of extraordinary.\"",
      "On the Sphere\u2019s website, the venue details how it uses AI and said, \u201cThrough \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 at Sphere, Sphere is leading the way in applying AI and visual effects to bring new creative possibilities to the entertainment industry, and wonder to the world.\u201d",
      "How Much Are Tickets to 'The Wizard of Oz' at the Sphere?",
      "Depending on seating, tickets for the film range in price from about $109 to $149.",
      "There are also two VIP packages available: the Good Witch Premium Experience and the Bad Witch Ultimate VIP Experience.",
      "The Good Witch experience \u2014 which includes expedited entry, a food and beverage credit and premium seating \u2014 costs about $320. The Bad Witch experience includes everything from the Good Witch package in addition to pre-show lounge access and a poster, and costs about $370."

      "\u201cWhat I knew is that by sharing some of our intimate information that we would see these two camps right? It would be people with an opinion versus people with an actual experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a perfect example to see in the comments section.\u201d",
      "In an ABC News special with Diane Sawyer that aired in August, Heming Willis spoke about FTD, a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects communication and behavior, and shared that she and Willis live separately so he can have constant care.",
      "Heming Willis, who has been married to the \"Die Hard\" actor since 2009, said in her latest Instagram video that she wanted to give the interview \"a couple days to sort of land and breathe\" and praised the special for raising awareness of FTD.",

      "\"That is what caregivers are up against \u2014 judgment from others and criticism from others,\" she said.",
      "The former journalist then read a quote from her upcoming book, \"The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope and Yourself on the Caregiving Path.\"",
      "\"Everyone will have an opinion, but you have to remind yourself that most don't have the experience to back it up,\" she read. \"And if that's the case, they shouldn't offer their two cents about it, and you shouldn't pay them any mind.\"",
      "\"Even if someone is closely familiar with dementia or the condition you are caring for, they aren't in your home, so they don't know how your person is behaving or your family dynamics,\" she added.",
      "In the caption, Heming Willis talked more about the difficulties that caregivers go through.",
      "\"Too often, caregivers are judged quickly and unfairly by those who haven\u2019t lived this journey or stood on the front lines of it,\" she wrote. \"Sharing openly may invite opinions, but more importantly, it creates connection and validation for those actually navigating the realities of caregiving every day.\"",
      "Willis has five daughters: Rumer, Scout and Tallulah \u2014 whom he shares with ex-wife Demi Moore\u2014 and Mabel and Evelyn, whom he welcomed with Heming Willis. The blended family often spends time together for holidays and birthdays.",
      "Tallulah commented on Heming Willis' post, \"I love you so much. We love you so much. Thank you for all you do for us and our family.\"",

      "In \"Thursday Murder Club,\" a Netflix movie based on Richard Osman's novel of the same name, four residents in the Coopers Chase retirement home have a hobby of trying to solve cold cases. Then, they find themselves in the middle of an active investigation.",
      "At the start of the film, they\u2019re faced with two conundrums: A case from the 1970s in which a woman was stabbed and fell out of a window; and the fact that Ian, the man who owns the land the home is built on, is going through a nasty divorce and has to sell \u2014 no matter who he mows down in the process.",
      "The members of the Club include Helen Mirren (as Elizabeth), Pierce Brosnan (as Ron), Ben Kingsley (as Ibrahim), Celia Imrie (as Joyce) and, from her bed in a coma, Susan Kirby as Penny, the former policewoman who helped her friends (now members) get old case logs to solve.",
      "On top of that we\u2019ve got familiar, most-welcome faces in Richard E. Grant (Bobby), David Tennant (Ian), Tom Ellis (Jason), and Jonathan Pryce (Stephen), all of whom turn up playing various dubious characters.",
      "Naomi Ackie (Donna) is the policewoman who\u2019s stuck serving tea to her co-workers until the Club tricks the force into putting her on Tony\u2019s murder investigation.",
      "Beyond the central mystery, there are side stories.",
      "Elizabeth has a mysterious background (turns out she worked for MI6) and a beloved husband (Pryce) with dementia. Ron, a former union organizer, has a famous son whose star is fading. Ibrahim lives meticulously but never felt he fit in anywhere. Joyce\u2019s hard-driving hedge fund daughter who turns out to be an unexpected ally. Elizabeth makes two newfound friends in Donna and Ian\u2019s assistant Bogdan (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), one of which turns out to not be as much of a friend as she\u2019d imagined.",
      "Read on for a rundown of what happens.",
      "Who Dies and Who Are the Killers in \u2018Thursday Murder Club\u2019?",
      "The story really picks up when the murders start. Ian\u2019s partner Tony (Geoff Bell) turns up dead after an argument with Ian \u2014 he won\u2019t sell his portion of the property, since his dear aunt lives in the home. Then, Ian himself also keels over.",
      "What might surprise viewers is to find out there\u2019s a link among all of these players to the cold case the Club has been trying to solve \u2014 one that involves a long-missing third partner (and crime lord) in the home, who has full control over what happens to the home after Tony and Ian snuff it.",
      "In the end, after a lot of tea and cake, fooling the police, Club trickery and a sudden buyer who turns up to purchase the property and save it, here\u2019s whodunit for all four murders. Yep, all four.",
      "Tony is done in by Bogdan, who swears he didn\u2019t mean to do it. Bogdan is an illegal Polish worker in the UK and Tony wouldn\u2019t give him back his passport.",
      "The cold case's solution also relates to the residents of Coopers Chase.",
      "Peter, Angela\u2019s boyfriend at the time, killed his girlfriend. Early on we learn that he probably was guilty all along \u2014 but was considered \u201cone of the boys\u201d by the police at the time and allowed to disappear.",
      "Well, not all of \u201cthe boys\u201d agreed with that \u2014 Penny, who was low person at the station at the time, was sure Peter had killed Angela, and tired of seeing so many abusers get off, she killed him herself. Her husband John kept this a secret for decades.",
      "When Ian decided to start digging up the church and gravesite ahead of selling off the land (and repurposing the home as an events location), John knew he\u2019d find the bones of Mercer, which he and Penny had hidden in the graveyard.",
      "He worried his wife would be implicated after all these years, and took out Ian with a needle full of fentanyl. Once John confesses, the rest of the Club leave him for a last moment with his comatose wife, knowing he will use another fentanyl needle to let her go to a peaceful rest (because once he\u2019s jailed, he can\u2019t be there for her).",
      "Is Coopers Chase saved?",
      "It almost certainly is! Elizabeth suggests that Joyce\u2019s financially-focused daughter Joanna (Ingrid Oliver) should buy the place, an offer Joanna finds \u201cintriguing.\u201d And since Coopers Chase appears in Osman\u2019s sequels, it\u2019s safe to say this was only an attempted murder.",
      "As of now, Netflix hasn\u2019t confirmed that they plan to make movies of the rest of Osman\u2019s books, but we already know we\u2019re ready to return to the scenes of the crimes."

      "The series, originally made for Starz before finding its home at Netflix, has been a mainstay in the streamer\u2019s Top 10 list in the U.S. since its July release. It has become the subject of multiple group chats and fan edits on social media, and a new ship has set sail as a result of the eight-episode season: Margo (Malin \u00c5kerman) and Sophie (Brittany Snow). The Instagram account for \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d even posted a callout for viewers to cast their vote for what their couple name should be.",
      "\u201cI had a lot of confidence in what the show was,\u201d Cutter tells TODAY.com, adding if Netflix could bring in the viewership, \u201cI know I can keep them watching the show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI started to let myself be hopeful,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut I still could have never predicted the wide range of people that seem to love the show. That\u2019s shocking to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives,\u201d which is an adaptation of author May Cobb\u2019s novel, follows Sophie O\u2019Neil and her husband, Graham O\u2019Neil (Evan Jonigkeit), as they move with their son from the Northeast to a small town in east Texas. She falls in with a group of Southern female socialites, which includes queen bee Margo Banks, who happens to be married to Graham\u2019s hotshot new boss, Jed Banks (Dermot Mulroney), an aspiring politician. The group\u2019s idea of a good time includes going boar hunting, a lot of drinking and for some, even hooking up with one another. It doesn\u2019t take long for Sophie to fall under Margo\u2019s spell, and the two meet up for secret romantic rendezvouses. At the same time, they\u2019re grappling with the latest drama to hit the small town: the murder of teenager Abby Jackson.",
      "In twists that deviate from the book, Margo ends up being Abby\u2019s killer \u2014 not Jill (Katie Lowes), one of the moms in the girls group whose 18-year-old son, Brad, is also secretly hooking up with Margo. And, Margo does not die in the TV adaptation, but she does at the end of the book.",
      "Cutter says she knew \u201cwell before\u201d \u00c5kerman was cast as Margo that she wanted Margo as the killer in the show.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the first things when I read the book that I knew would be one of the big changes,\u201d she explains. \u201cI knew I wanted her to do it, and I knew I wanted her to stay alive.\u201d",
      "She also crafted a grittier personal backstory for her Margo, which includes a complicated relationship with brother Kyle. Cutter says her \u201cmain intention\u201d with the changes she made was to \u201cgive everybody more sort of character work to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI also just wanted to open up a different part of Texas,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cIt is fun to watch rich people, but it\u2019s also interesting to open up a different world and to have a real divide of the classes.\u201d",
      "She adds that she loves the scene of Sophie showing up at a trailer park to visit a naked Kyle during his \u201cmeth bender.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt opens up the world and opens up plot possibilities,\u201d she says.",
      "After reading the book, Cutter traveled to Longview, Texas, about two hours east of Dallas, to do research, and not only met Cobb, but Cobb's high school best friend.",
      "\u201cWithin 10 minutes, it was totally the \u2018I love you\u2019 scene (in the show with Margo and Sophie),\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cIt was just a blast, and we talk, like, three times a week now,\u201d Cutter says.",
      "Cobb previously told TODAY.com she feels that Cutter \u201ctook the spirit of the book, of these rowdy, sassy \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 Texas women, and just turned it up to an 11.\u201d",
      "She added that Cutter made the show \u201ceven more unapologetic and juicy and bonkers than the book.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally blowing out the different storylines and adding in some new characters and giving existing characters different backstories,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cIt's escapist fun at a time when I feel like people are really looking for that.\u201d",
      "About That Margo, Sophie, Abby Fan Theory",
      "When Margo and Sophie first meet at an NRA party at Margo and Jed's house, Sophie offers Margo a Xanax. Later on, Sophie and Margo again take Sophie's Xanax before embarking on a blackout bender the night Abby is murdered.",
      "Cutter says she didn\u2019t really think of the Xanax connection as an Easter egg but more of a plot device for the blackout and to \u201cvery specifically\u201d establish Sophie\u2019s state of mind.",
      "\u201cI try and always be as character-motivated as possible and not so much for foreshadowing, but I\u2019m glad it worked out,\u201d she says.",
      "What could possibly be foreshadowing, however, is the boar hunting outing that the wives embark on. Sophie, new to shooting, takes down a boar \u2014 but doesn\u2019t kill it. Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), who also happens to be the sheriff\u2019s wife, delivers the fatal shot to put the boar out of its misery.",
      "As the series progresses, Sophie becomes the prime suspect in Abby\u2019s murder because her gun is the one used to kill Abby, and surveillance footage in the woods shows Abby and Sophie interacting the night Abby was killed. The show actually begins with a scene of a wounded woman, who viewers later learn is Abby, running in the woods shouting for help while she's being shot at. Sophie can\u2019t remember the events of the night because she was blacked out. After various other clues arise in the case, police presume Jill is the killer, and Sophie is seemingly free.",
      "Sophie, however, pieces together that Margo is actually the killer and confronts her friend turned lover, who begs her not to tell, saying she loves her and \u201cfixed it.\u201d",
      "One fan theory states that Sophie actually fired the initial shots at Abby, but she didn\u2019t kill her \u2014 just like the boar \u2014 and Margo stepped in to deliver the kill shot to protect both Sophie and herself. Margo just never told Sophie about those initial shots, possibly to protect Sophie, who expressed guilt to Margo over a previous accident in the Northeast when she hit and killed a pedestrian while drinking and driving, according to the fan theory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great theory,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to confirm or deny because who knows what will come out in future seasons.\u201d",
      "The Margo and Sophie of It All",
      "Before Sophie, Margo was in a secret romantic relationship on the side with Callie. But once Sophie comes to town, she becomes her focus, and Margo dumps Callie.",
      "Margo tells Sophie, \u201cThere\u2019s something about me that wants to protect you,\u201d and by contrast, later says to Callie, \u201cI\u2019m Margo f------ Banks. I don\u2019t need protection.\u201d",
      "Was this moment with Sophie a genuine one for Margo, and she was actually looking out for someone who wasn\u2019t herself?",
      "\u201cI always feel like with Margo \u2014 and actually I feel this way about humans in general \u2014 this is how I like to write characters. Everything can be both things at once,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cYou can be a manipulator but also mean it. So I do think she feels that way about Sophie, and I think that\u2019s one of the beautiful things about Brittany Snow\u2019s performance, is that everyone, I think, kind of feels like, \u2018I wish I could just wrap this girl up in a blanket because she\u2019s causing herself a lot of trouble.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd I think Margo definitely feels protective of her and loving of her, and it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all out of the goodness of her heart either. She obviously had ulterior motives.\u201d",
      "Cutter adds she believes the \u201crichest characters\u201d are \u201csort of femme fatale.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fun if they\u2019re just completely calculated monsters, but it\u2019s not fun if they don\u2019t have any evil intent, either,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere should always be multiple layers going on.\u201d",
      "Cobb said the Margo-Sophie dynamic in the show is similar to the book with \u201cSophie falling under her spell.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do think Margo has feelings for her, but Margo is a more transactional person and manipulator,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she genuinely cares for Sophie, but, you know, watch out if, oh, I just can't wait. I hope there's a Season 2 so we can find out what's going to happen.\u201d (The show has not yet been officially picked up for Season 2.)",
      "There are, of course, Margo and Sophie fans who want the pairing to be the endgame, while others don\u2019t think they\u2019d make it in the long run because Margo can be so toxic and self-serving.",
      "\u201cI just love Margo even \u2014 I love her either way,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, a Margo truther. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s evil.

I love you.\u2019 And Sophie goes, \u2018I love you, too.\u2019 It was exactly how I pictured it when I wrote it, which is that thing of \u2026 women do this all the time. We make fast friends, and we say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 not meaning it, exactly. \u2026 But then Sophie saying it in a different way. Obviously, she\u2019s not in love with her yet, but Brittany is putting all those levels into it where you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, does she love her love her?\u2019 She\u2019s not just saying it back in the same tone that Margo was saying it.

Husband's great, treats me great. And yet I cannot resist the siren call of Margo Banks.\u2019\u201d",

The stinging levy, one of the highest on any U.S. trading partner in the world, has raised concerns that it could push India closer to China despite years of tensions.",
      "\u201cUntil about three, four months ago, relations between China and India were not bad, they were very bad. They were not talking to each other,\u201d said Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean diplomat and former president of the United Nations Security Council.",
      "\u201cI have to give credit where it\u2019s due: President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 50% tariff on India is one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got in recent times,\u201d Mahbubani said Wednesday at an event in Hong Kong organized by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Centre on Contemporary China and the World.",
      "India, along with China, is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil, which Trump says is helping to fund Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. New Delhi says such criticism is \u201cunjustified and unreasonable,\u201d and that the U.S. previously encouraged it to buy the oil to keep global prices from soaring as Western countries suspended their purchases.",
      "While India and China share a common grievance over Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145%, analysts say their relationship still faces major challenges and that Modi\u2019s China visit is mainly a symbolic display of resilience.",
      "\u201cXi wants Modi and India to show that they are working with him and with China to the extent that they are not following the Trump or U.S. lead in containing China,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the SOAS University of London.",
      "Earlier this month, the Chinese ambassador to New Delhi delivered a rare public defense of India against the tariff increase, calling the U.S. a \u201cbully.\u201d",
      "It was a major step up from the deep freeze that began in 2020 with a border clash in India\u2019s Himalayan region of Ladakh that killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers and plunged relations so low that the two countries suspended direct flights.",
      "Only seven months ago, India was entering Trump\u2019s second presidential term in a relatively strong position, with Modi among the first world leaders to visit his \u201cdear friend\u201d at the White House.",
      "But tensions soon arose, with Trump complaining that Apple was producing iPhones in India instead of the U.S. India also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that he brokered a ceasefire in its four-day conflict with neighboring Pakistan.",
      "New Delhi was further incensed weeks later when Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting.",
      "\u201cThe Indians saw this as a slap in the face for them,\u201d Mahbubani said. \u201cSo there is now, even as we are speaking, a tremendous amount of re-evaluation going on in Delhi about where India\u2019s place in the world is.\u201d",
      "At the same time, China and India have been moving cautiously to restore their relationship, reaching a deal to resolve their 2020 border standoff and announcing the resumption of direct flights.",

      "One of the biggest is China\u2019s ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s archrival and a fellow nuclear power. During their conflict in May, Pakistan said it had used Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian military aircraft.",

      "Though India and China are strong trading partners, that has not been enough to smooth over other diplomatic issues.",
      "Earlier this month, after a meeting in New Delhi between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, Beijing released a readout suggesting Jaishankar had acknowledged that Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy, \u201cis a part of China.\u201d",
      "When asked if Jaishankar made that statement, an Indian government official who was familiar with the discussions between the diplomats but not authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News that there was no change in India\u2019s position on Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe stressed that like the rest of the world, India has a relationship with Taiwan that focuses on economic, technology and cultural ties,\u201d the official said.",
      "The clarification, which was also reported by Indian news organizations, prompted Beijing to double down, saying it was a \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the facts.\u201d",

      "The two countries also have other border disputes as well as a manufacturing rivalry that may only worsen as companies try to shift production from China. China, which is worried about technology transfer, has imposed curbs on the export of rare earth materials to India and recalled some of its nationals working in specialized roles.",
      "\u201cThe meeting between Modi and Xi will not remove the structural issues between India and China,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut the big issue for Xi outside of China now is U.S. pressure, and making sure India does not appear to be on the U.S. side is therefore significant.\u201d",

      "On the visa revocations, he added, \u201cWe will see exactly what it means and how it applies to any of our delegation, and we will respond accordingly.\u201d",
      "Several European foreign ministers criticized the decision ahead of a meeting in Copenhagen on Saturday. A U.N. General Assembly \u201ccannot be subject to any restrictions on access,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told reporters.",

      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.",
      "In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.",
      "Trump also has a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange that was launched last fall and is majority-controlled by the Trump family.",
      "World Liberty\u2019s flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. The family also stands to gain from an agreement by a technology company backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates to invest $2 billion in one of World Liberty\u2019s stablecoin products.",
      "That currency will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, whose CEO stepped down in 2023 after the company pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age, including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by the long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage, the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but the timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then age 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram were the choices of Sylvia Foulkes, then age 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff members either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2-inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Minogue, the Australian singer then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits, as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: They surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the United States only in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark it, she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: A former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise money for big projects, and the 300 million-pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "Instead of a presidential palace, he is speaking from a humble house in Dover, a port city in the south of England. And the Free Republic of Verdis, the country he claims to have founded in 2019, is nothing more than a small strip of uninhabited forest on the border between Croatia and Serbia, more than 1,000 miles away.",

      "\u201cVerdis was an idea when I was about 14 but it came back, and actually, we actually properly created the state after I had turned 18,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason being is it was just an idea that initially came up with a lot of people that I know that did humanitarian work in Ukraine. And we wanted to do something that was a bit, a bit bigger than, you know, just doing aid to one country.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cWe want to be a neutral state. We want to be a hub for NGOs. We have a massive humanitarian background.\u201d",
      "Those lofty goals may be tempered by the reality of neighboring countries who don\u2019t recognize the existence of Verdis and may be hostile to its potential citizens.",
      "\u201cIn October 2023 is when we started a settlement, and a few days later Croatian authorities quickly destroyed that settlement,\u201d Jackson said, noting that he was given a permanent ban from Croatia and the other settlers were banned for three months.",
      "He added, \u201cI\u2019ve been to Verdis a lot of times before Croatian authorities invaded Verdis. We did a lot of cadastral work, a lot of surveying. We planted a flag for the first time earlier that year.\u201d",
      "Jackson was at least partially inspired by Liberland, another unclaimed pocket of land between Croatia and Serbia that in 2015 was turned into a microstate by Czech politician V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka.",
      "It is a symbolic state that offers virtual citizenship and an economy based on cryptocurrencies, but it has not been recognized by any official country, and Croatian authorities have blocked physical access to it.",
      "Jackson says that while he shares some principles with Liberland, he wants the Free Republic of Verdis to become an actual settlement whose citizens are driven by noble principles.",
      "\u201cWe have the opportunity to test, for example, new systems of governance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can allow citizens to have a bit of a fresh start. So people coming from all over the world that want to try something new basically.\u201d",
      "For now, Verdis only exists on a website where people can apply for citizenship. According to Jackson, 15,000 people have applied so far, and 400 have already been handed over physical passports and IDs. Legitimate or not, Verdisian documents have been used to cross borders.",
      "\u201cThere are instances of successful crossings but it\u2019s not something that we will promote unless that country recognizes our documents officially,\u201d Jackson chuckles.",
      "Jackson says he now lives in \u201cexile\u201d in Dover, where he socializes with friends and plays video games.",
      "Together with his minister of internal affairs and other officials he is planning to attend a protest outside the Croatian embassy in London, according to the Republic of Verdis\u2019 official website. \u201cWe will also hold a general meet-and-greet at a local cafe or pub after the protest,\u201d the website says.",

      "Those behind it insist this campaign to raise the English flag, known as St. George\u2019s Cross, is an expression of patriotism; others see the sudden prevalence of the banner, sometimes associated with soccer hooliganism and racism, as a hostile statement of surging far-right sentiment.",
      "The febrile debate went global this week when Elon Musk, the former adviser to President Donald Trump and backer of far-right movements globally, posted a picture of the flag on X. Vice President JD Vance also staged his latest intervention into British life, urging people to \u201cpush back against the crazies\u201d who criticize flying the flag.",

      "In a country where the national flag is rare outside of sporting events, the banners now fluttering above a highway here in Stevenage are typical of those popping up nationwide in recent weeks as part of the grassroots \u201cOperation Raise the Colours.\u201d",
      "The flags were put up here last week by a five-strong group including Louis Turvey, who read about the national movement on Facebook, where he said he gets most of his news.",

      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, a hipster mustache, a low-buttoned shirt and a single earring, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell, you know what? I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",

      "However, he soon experienced just how charged this debate has become when, just as his group was packing up, someone threw two Molotov cocktails at them, the second cutting Turvey\u2019s head and covering his face with blood. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he said, visibly shaken by an incident he says has put a pause on his flag-hoisting activities for the time being at least.",
      "Critics see darker forces undergirding the broader flag campaign.",
      "They view this groundswell as little more than an aggressive, provocative message to people with an immigrant background and nonwhite residents.",
      "The anti-racist campaign group Hope Not Hate reported that the founders of Operation Raise the Colours include \u201cwell-known far-right extremists\u201d and allies of Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who has become a leading nationalist voice in Britain. Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",
      "These fears are widespread. When a St. George\u2019s Cross was painted on the wall of St. John the Baptist church, in the town of Lincoln, the vicar, Rachel Heskins, saw it as a clear \u201cattempt to intimidate\u201d the diverse local community.",
      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism, which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",
      "National identity in Britain is doubly complicated because the United Kingdom includes the nations of England, Wales and Scotland, and the province of Northern Ireland. During the soccer World Cup and on some public holidays, England\u2019s banner is widely used by people of all political and demographic stripes, but outside of those events it has been co-opted by nationalists, the far right and even fascists.",
      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",
      "That\u2019s certainly the experience of Moj, 44, a Briton with Bangladeshi heritage, sitting with his 11-year-old daughter in Stevenage\u2019s faded postwar town square.",
      "\u201cI remember being a kid and getting called all sorts of racist names. I don\u2019t get that anymore,\u201d said Moj, who like many in this town of 80,000 declined to give his second name for fear of local backlash.",
      "Despite the improvement, the flag still holds negative connotations for him. \u201cIn certain areas, if I see an English flag, there is always a part of me that thinks, OK, I\u2019ve got to be a bit careful here,\u201d he said.",
      "Stevenage was dreamed up in 1946 as an example of \u201cnew town\u201d modernism, an integrated residential-commercial space in which to house families scattered by war. Today \u2014 despite a much needed \u00a31 billion ($1.35 billion) regeneration scheme on the way \u2014 its faded pebbledash and dated glass shopfronts feel like a cipher for modern Britain.",
      "As is the case across the West, many Britons are increasingly concerned and angry about rising prices, decrepit public services, a lack of housing \u2014 and the perception that immigration has been mismanaged.",
      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future. Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",
      "At first, he thought the blood running down his face was acid (acid attacks are on the rise in the U.K.), and he said the incident has only added to the chronic anxiety stemming from a homophobic attack in 2018.",
      "Though he decries any form of racism or negativity associated with the flag movement, he says that part of his motivation stemmed from the perception that the current Labour government \u201cis not siding with English people\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s probably why people are so upset at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum-seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population. At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",
      "And so, amid all this, up goes the English flag.",
      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katwala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"

      "The adoption of drones marks the latest evolution in a conflict that has raged for over half a century in Colombia, experts said. In 2016, the government reached a peace agreement with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, FARC. The agreement was criticized from many sides, including some FARC militants who refused to disarm and continued operating in smaller numbers.",
      "With the reduction in their ranks, militant groups \u2014 no strangers to asymmetrical warfare \u2014 changed tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of a sort of criminal learning,\u201d Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cThey see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, the extremely broad use of drones. They think, \u2018Hey, we can do that.\u2019 Then one group starts in Colombia, and it spreads like wildfire.\u201d",
      "Over the past few years, videos emerged on social media of militants experimenting with store-bought drones. A video from 2023 shows fighters from a FARC dissident group testing the weight of a grenade tied to the body of a drone with a piece of string.",
      "\u201cOften, these munitions are very rudimentary,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cThe majority of attacks have been aimed at police or military targets or rival armed groups, but often they are exploding, obviously, in areas that affect civilians, because they are, by definition, an indiscriminate weapon.\u201d",
      "\u2018Drone comes, drone goes\u2019",
      "Civilians, especially children, in Cauca and Catatumbo have ended up on both ends of drone attacks. Last August, authorities arrested a 16-year-old who they said had operated a drone that dropped a bomb on a police building.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of the guys who put together these drones, who run them being 16, 17, 18 years old,\u201d Dickinson said. Child recruitment in Colombia has soared in the past several years, she said, increasing over 1,000% between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Commercial drones are relatively simple to operate, and children, already predisposed to mastering new technology, are ideal targets for recruitment. \u201cMy son is 13 and manages a drone perfectly,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "Children in Colombia are increasingly vulnerable to the lures of militant groups, who have used social media apps like TikTok and WhatsApp to promote a glamorized version of the guerrilla lifestyle, according to experts, who also point to the absence of schoolteachers, many of whom have fled the violence in the region, as a contributing factor.",
      "A cycle of attacks, forced recruitment and instability has brought about Colombia\u2019s largest displacement from one region in at least 28 years. More than 73,000 people have fled Norte de Santander, according to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office of Colombia.",
      "For half a year, Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Abril, 55, known to his friends and family as Carmito, has been running for his life. The farmer and social leader from Catatumbo told NBC News he\u2019s a target of the ELN. In January, he was rescued by military police along with 19 other farmers after the rebel group launched several attacks against rival FARC dissidents. Speaking to Colombian media weeks after he was rescued, he said he was targeted due to his past in farmworker struggles and his previous support for the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, a party linked with FARC.",
      "Now in hiding, Abril hears updates from his siblings and nephews who remain in Catatumbo.",
      "Drones, which at one time promised to be a technological advancement for farmers in Colombia, have become a symbol of terror.",
      "\u201cCatatumbo is becoming drone comes, drone goes,\u201d Abril said. \u201cThere is a fear of drones since farmers are military targets for the ELN.\u201d",
      "Amid the exchange of attacks from the ELN and FARC dissidents in the region, drones have dropped explosives on the homes of people in the countryside. In May, a 12-year-old and his mother were killed in Tib\u00fa when a drone dropped a grenade on their house, Abril said.",
      "\u2018A major risk for the future\u2019",
      "The military and government of Colombia have recently taken measures to stem the surge of drone attacks. The Defense Ministry has proposed a series of bills that would create a national registry for drones and classify strikes on civilians as terrorism.",
      "Soldiers have also started using anti-drone technology, devices that can locate unmanned aircraft and jam their signals. Since implementing these defenses, Mej\u00eda said, his forces have reduced the number of these attacks by 80% in Cauca.",
      "Devices for countering drones are by no means ubiquitous. Soldiers and police often try to shoot drones out of the sky, a relatively ineffective measure that creates its own public safety risks when they are shot down above crowded areas.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very hard to shoot down,\u201d said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf you\u2019re a civilian living in rural Colombia, and there is a drone that can drop bombs from hundreds of feet above you or can fly in and detonate the explosive, you really have virtually no recourse.\u201d",
      "The country is facing another challenge to its ability to fight the rapidly evolving strategies and equipment of militant forces. At risk are hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid tied up in a certification process of the country\u2019s commitment to the war on drugs.",
      "Colombia has narrowly avoided decertification in past years, but it has failed to cut the illegal growth of coca crops, which has risen each year in the past decade, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "By Sept. 15, President Donald Trump will decide whether to cut off aid to Colombia. Cutting off the supply of resources and technologies to the country could cripple its efforts to fight militants in the future, said Alberto Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Ferrero, a former general for Colombia\u2019s armed forces. He added that it would be \u201cvery bad for our strategy, for approach, and especially for the very, very strong relationship that the military forces of Colombia and our national police had with the U.S. for decades.\u201d",
      "The adoption of drone warfare by militant groups in Latin America is not unique to Colombia. Already, Mexican cartels have used drones to attack police and one another. In Ecuador, a drone targeted the roof of a high-security prison to force a jailbreak.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a major risk for the future,\u201d Ziemer said. \u201cI think the region as a whole has yet to come to terms with the scale and potential scale of the threat we\u2019re seeing.\u201d"

      "Initially, Monday\u2019s pair of deadly Israeli strikes appeared to be a \u201cdouble tap\u201d attack, in which the same target was hit twice in quick succession. The tactic, military analysts say, is to wait for first responders to race to the scene of the first attack before striking again.",
      "But an NBC News analysis of newly obtained video has found that at least four Israeli munitions were fired at the medical complex.",

      "Three private Chinese companies helped China carry out one of the boldest hacking operations to date, including snooping on text messages from Kamala Harris\u2019 and Donald Trump\u2019s campaigns, according to a coalition of U.S. agencies and 12 allied governments.",
      "The operation, known as Salt Typhoon, hacked into telecommunication companies around the world, including AT&T and Verizon last year, allowing it to potentially access text and telephone communications between millions of people and track their locations.",
      "A 37-page technical report released Wednesday was signed by the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as intelligence and law enforcement bodies from Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom, among others. It said the campaign, which has been going on since 2021, also targeted government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks around the world.",
      "An FBI spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Salt Typhoon has hacked more than 200 companies across 80 countries.",
      "NBC News reported in July that the Defense Department quietly concluded this year that Salt Typhoon had also broken into at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year before it was detected.",
      "The three companies that have been helping China\u2019s Ministry of State Security in the campaign are Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology, Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology and Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology.",
      "While the Treasury Department sanctioned the Sichuan-based Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology over Salt Typhoon activity in January, Western governments had not previously accused the two other companies of global hacking operations.",
      "Little information about the companies is available online, and they could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government has denied involvement in overseas hacking activities and has accused the U.S. and its allies of similar behavior.",
      "It is remarkable that the three firms appeared to be actually functioning companies, not merely fronts for Chinese intelligence, said Dakota Cary, a China analyst at the cybersecurity company SentinelOne.",
      "\u201cWhich means the MSS [Ministry of State Security] effectively used three private companies working in collaboration to hit some of the most important collection targets on the planet,\u201d Cary told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIt is inconceivable the U.S. would ask a private company to hack Xi\u2019s phone,\u201d he added, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "While Salt Typhoon does not exclusively hack telecommunications companies, it has proven remarkably adept at doing so. Its hack of AT&T and Verizon alone gave China access to phone data on more than a million people in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "That kind of access gives intelligence agencies the potential not only to spy on phone calls and text messages, but also to track people\u2019s locations, the report found.",
      "\u201cThe data stolen through this activity against foreign telecommunications and Internet service providers (ISPs), as well as intrusions in the lodging and transportation sectors, ultimately can provide Chinese intelligence services with the capability to identify and track their targets\u2019 communications and movements around the world,\u201d it said.",
      "AT&T and Verizon have said they have removed the hackers from their systems, although they remain vulnerable to being broken into again."

      "Trump himself had appeared less certain earlier this week about the possibility of a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Kremlin cast new doubt on the process Wednesday.",
      "\"We view these discussions negatively,\" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, dismissing the idea that Russia would accept the presence of European troops on its neighbor's territory as part of the security guarantees being worked out for Ukraine.",
      "Peskov praised the \"very substantive, constructive, useful, and necessary\" summit between Putin and Trump in Alaska, but said it was not helpful to negotiate in public.",
      "He reiterated that there are no dates planned for any summit between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. \u201cThe heads of the negotiating teams remain in contact,\u201d Peskov told reporters in his daily briefing. Any further high-level contacts \u201cmust be well-prepared in order to produce meaningful results,\u201d he said.",

      "But, he said in a post on X, \u201cunfortunately, the Russians are currently sending negative signals regarding meetings and further developments.\u201d",

      "India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a key partner for the West in the Indo-Pacific region, relies heavily on trade with the United States, its largest export market.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to stand firm in the face of what he termed \"the politics of economic selfishness.\"",
      "The 50% levy risks decades of warming of ties between Washington and New Delhi.",
      "The tariffs are a reversal of the favorable position India seemed to enjoy early in the second Trump administration because of its expanding economic relationship with the United States, its strategic importance in relationship to China and Trump's personal relationship with Modi.",
      "Vice President JD Vance \u2014 whose wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants \u2014 said Sunday on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that the United States had applied \"aggressive economic leverage\" on India to \"try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",

      "India and the United States have yet to reach a bilateral trade deal, even after having held five rounds of negotiations. That's mostly because India is unwilling to open those sectors to cheaper American imports, as it could threaten the livelihood of millions of Indians.",
      "Modi is also under immense domestic pressure not to cave in to the United States, but Trump has shown little sign of softening his demand that India stop buying Russian oil as he shifted his focus in recent weeks to brokering peace in Ukraine.",
      "India's continued purchase of Russian oil is actually informed by past U.S. requests to keep the price of oil low amid Western-led sanctions on Russia.",
      "\u201cThey bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,\u201d Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. \"It was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn\u2019t want oil prices going up.\u201d",
