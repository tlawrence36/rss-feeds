      "A detective must prove his innocence to an artificial intelligence judge in the new film \u201cMercy,\u201d starring Chris Pratt and Rebecca Ferguson",
      "It\u2019s a bold filmmaking choice to have a countdown clock on the screen for most of your movie.",
      "In the best-case scenario for a movie like \u201cMercy,\u201d in which a Los Angeles detective has prove his innocence to an artificial intelligence judge within said time limit, it heightens the tension. Who hasn\u2019t gotten sweaty palms in, say, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie when the bomb is ticking down and Tom Cruise still hasn\u2019t cleared the building? Why not just extend it for the duration?",
      "Perhaps in a better movie it might have worked. Sadly in \u201cMercy,\u201d in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s an ever-present reminder of just how much longer you must endure until you too are free of Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson and that chair.",
      "In \u201cMercy\u2019s\u201d near-future Los Angeles, AI has been adopted by law enforcement and the judicial system to more efficiently clean up the city\u2019s crime and blight problem. It\u2019s a potent and not too far-flung idea that might have been a fascinating and provocative premise for a movie attempting to grapple with the implications of so-called progress that had the potential to be a worthy companion to another Cruise movie, \u201cMinority Report.\u201d But that would have required a more serious script than screenwriter Marco van Belle\u2019s and more vision than filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov managed to muster.",
      "When Pratt\u2019s character, Chris Raven, wakes up, barefoot and strapped into an electric chair sitting in the middle of an oddly large room that looks a bit like the holodeck, he\u2019s informed by an IMAX-sized AI judge (Ferguson) that he has 90 minutes to prove he didn\u2019t kill his wife (Annabelle Wallis). In this world, the incarcerated are guilty until proved innocent. They\u2019ve cut lawyers and juries out of the equation as well. Instead, the accused have everyone\u2019s digital footprint at their disposal to help build their own case. For Raven, that means everything from ring cam footage to his teenage daughter\u2019s secret Instagram account.",
      "Unfortunately for Raven, he woke up with some gaps in his memory between angrily busting into his home to confront his wife about something and being arrested and bludgeoned at a bar later that day. Raven was also one of the original champions of the AI judge system, which in a more curious script might have resulted in some real stakes. This story is more hung up on increasingly tortured plot contrivances, however, including Raven\u2019s drinking problem following the death of a partner killed on the job. To its credit, the story does really keep it ambiguous as to whether Raven did it or not, but to say that it earns any sort of investment in the outcome is a stretch.",

      "One of the most confounding choices is to have a real actor playing the AI judge. Wouldn\u2019t it have been more interesting and provocative to use an AI creation as the impartial Judge Maddox instead of stripping Ferguson of all emotion and charisma in the role? At times, it feels as tedious as watching a stranger\u2019s increasingly frustrating call with a robotic customer service representative play out in real time.",
      "For how reliant this movie is on screens and keeping Pratt alone, one might assume that \u201cMercy\u201d was a socially distanced, COVID-era leftover instead of something made in 2024. Kali Reis, playing another LAPD agent named Jaq who decides to help Raven investigate on the ground is the one that gets to be out in the real-world chasing leads and hunches. But for the most part, she\u2019s seen only through FaceTime and bodycam footage. Like Raven, we\u2019re largely stuck in the chair watching things play out on multiple screens, acutely aware of just how much time is left.",
      "\u201cMercy,\u201d an Amazon MGM release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cdrug content, bloody images, some strong language, teen smoking and violence.\u201d Running time: 101 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "The production team of Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera demanded their names be removed from programs due to a restaging decision",
      "NEW YORK -- In a dispute of operatic proportions, the production team of Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera ordered their names stripped from programs over a restaging decision, and the company intends to bring back sets of a retired 2009 version.",
      "Director Carrie Cracknell\u2019s production opened on Dec. 31, 2023, in her Met debut, moving the action from early 19th century Seville, Spain, to a contemporary American industrial town. The character Escamillo is a rodeo star, not a bullfighter, in this staging.",
      "When the production opened, Escamillo entered in a red Jaguar convertible that crossed the stage as he started his famous Toreador\u2019s Song. He was accompanied by his entourage in three pickup trucks, all the vehicles moving on wires guided by a computer.",
      "In the restaging decision, the Jaguar and two trucks were eliminated. Escamillo walked in with his followers, some pushing a motorcycle. One of the pickup trucks from the original staging was kept, in a stationary position throughout the act.",
      "\u201cWe were furious,\u201d set designer Michael Levine said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my name attached to the production because it\u2019s not a representation of the original artistic intent. \u2026 I\u2019ve never come across anything on this level where they literally change the basic concept.\u201d",
      "Levine said the Met's assistant general manager for production notified him of the change last fall, just ahead of the Oct. 28 opening.",
      "\u201cI get a phone call from John Sellars saying: We\u2019re in terrible financial straits and we have to make cuts to the opera. We are going to cut the automation of the trucks,\u201d Levine said.",
      "Levine and Cracknell attempted to find a solution such as putting the cars on the stage turntable but said the Met wasn\u2019t willing to negotiate. Levine said his contract specified changes could not be made after opening night and he removed his name. Levine said the Met then gave the rest of the production team one day to decide whether they would follow suit.",
      "Cracknell, Tom Scutt (costumes), Guy Hoare (lighting), rocafilm/Roland Horvath (projections) and Ann Yee (choreography) also asked their names to be dropped. After the names of the conductor and chorus master, the only person listed in programs was revival stage director Melanie Bacaling, who was an assistant stage director when the production premiered, followed by several inches of white space.",
      "\u201cIt was really an economic decision,\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said of the change. \u201cWe decided it was incredibly expensive to run, and it was not particularly effective. We decided to cut it.\u201d",
      "Gelb said the savings was more than $300,000.",
      "On Tuesday, Gelb announced 22 layoffs to the Met's administrative staff of 284, 4-15% temporary salary cuts and the reduction next season by one opera to 17. The moves are projected to save $15 million this fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27.",

The Met restaged it by the third performance, and Vick and his production team withdrew their names for the 2002-03 revival.

      "Valentino Garavani\u2019s death has cast a shadow over Paris Fashion Week",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Valentino Garavani\u2019s death cast a long shadow over the opening day of Paris Fashion Week menswear Tuesday, with front-row guests and industry figures mourning the passing of one of the last towering names of 20th-century couture \u2014 an Italian designer whose working life was closely entwined with the Paris runways.",
      "Valentino, 93, died at his Rome residence, the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said in a statement announcing his death. While he built his house in Rome, he spent decades presenting collections in France.",
      "He \u201cwas one of the last big couturiers who really embodied what was fashion in the 20th century,\u201d said Pierre Groppo, fashion editor-in-chief at Vanity Fair France.",
      "On a day meant to sell the future, many guests said they were thinking about what fashion has lost: the couturier as a living institution.",
      "Groppo pointed to the codes that made Valentino instantly legible \u2014 \u201cthe dots, the ruffles, the knots\u201d \u2014 and to a generation of designers who, he said, \u201cin a way, invented what is celebrity culture.\u201d",
      "Valentino\u2019s vision was built on a simple idea: make women look luminous, then make the moment unforgettable.",
      "He dressed Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor, among others, fixed his signature \u201cValentino red\u201d in the public imagination, and \u2014 through his decades-long partnership with Giancarlo Giammetti \u2014 helped turn the designer himself into part of the spectacle, as recognizable as the clients in his front row.",
      "Prominent fashion writer Luke Leitch framed the loss in similarly outsized terms, calling Valentino \u201cthe last of the fashion \u2018leviathans of that generation\u2019,\u201d and saying it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the end of a certain class of designer: figures whose names could carry a global house, and whose authority came not from viral speed but from permanence.",
      "Trained in Paris before founding his maison in Rome, Valentino became a rare bridge figure: Italian by origin, but fluent in the rituals that made Paris couture an institution. His career moved between those two capitals of elegance, bringing Roman grandeur into a system that still treats fashion not only as commerce, but as ceremony.",
      "Even as he aged, the house\u2019s founder kept turning up at its couture and ready-to-wear shows, as observed by one Associated Press journalist \u2014 until he eventually retreated from public life, all the while radiating quiet grandeur from his front-row seat.",
      "For some in Paris on Tuesday, the loss felt personal precisely because Valentino\u2019s world was never only Italian.",
      "Groppo recalled the designer as \u201cvery much more than a fashion brand,\u201d adding: \u201cIt was a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That lifestyle \u2014 couture polish, social glamour, and the conviction that elegance could be a form of power \u2014 remains a reference point even as fashion accelerates toward louder branding and faster cycles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad as he\u2019s so important to the fashion industry, and he contributed a lot and I cannot forget the stunning red he created,\u201d said Lolo Zhang, a Chinese fashion influencer attending Louis Vuitton \u2019s show in Paris.",
      "\u201cHe always celebrated pure beauty, and architecture for the silhouette, and how he used color. The old era just passed by.\u201d",
      "Other guests described a delayed realization \u2014 the kind that arrives only when a figure who seemed permanent is suddenly gone.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Actor Timothy Busfield was released from jail Tuesday night in New Mexico, where he is facing counts of child sexual abuse.",
      "Hours earlier, Busfield's attorneys successfully argued that the actor best known for appearances in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams\u201d and \u201cThirtysomething\u201d wasn't a danger to the community and shouldn't be behind bars while he awaits trial. Prosecutors sought to keep him in jail, outlining what they said was grooming behavior and abuse of power by Busfield over three decades.",
      "State District Court Judge David Murphy said while the crimes Busfield is accused of inherently are dangerous and involve children, prosecutors didn't prove the public wouldn't be safe if he's released.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of a pattern of criminal conduct, there are no similar allegations involving children in his past,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cRather this defendant self-surrendered and submitted himself to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, demonstrating compliance with the court order for his arrest.\u201d",
      "Outside the courthouse, Busfield's wife, actor Melissa Gilbert, thanked Murphy for the ruling. She also thanked friends, relatives, co-workers and strangers who she said have showered their family with love. Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to \u201980s TV series \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\" sat behind Busfield during the hearing. He was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit.",
      "Prosecutors declined to comment on the ruling.",
      "Busfield is facing two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse while working as a director on the set of the TV series \u201cThe Cleaning Lady,\" allegations that he denies. He was booked into jail after a warrant was issued for his arrest and he turned himself in.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department said a boy reported that Busfield touched him on his private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy\u2019s twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but he did not specify where and didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble, the complaint said.",
      "During the hearing Tuesday, Busfield's attorneys pointed out that the children initially said during interviews with police that Busfield didn't touch them inappropriately. Busfield's attorneys then accused the boys' parents of coaching their children toward incriminating statements after the boys lost lucrative roles on the show.",
      "Busfield's defense team called just one witness \u2014 Alan Caudillo, director of photography on \u201cThe Cleaning Lady\u201d \u2014 to testify that children on set were never left alone with individuals, and that the parents were the ones who encouraged hugs with adults on the set.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys later disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by Busfield. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",

      "The Sundance Film Festival kicks off Thursday in Park City, Utah, marking its final year there",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival may be a little bittersweet this year. It will be familiar in some ways as it kicks off on Thursday in Park City, Utah. There will be stars, from Natalie Portman to Charli XCX, and breakout discoveries, tearjerkers, comedies, thrillers, oddities that defy categorization and maybe even a few future Oscar nominees. The pop ups and sponsors will be out in full force on Main Street. The lines to get into the 90 movies premiering across 10 days will be long and the volunteers will be endlessly helpful and cheery in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "But the country\u2019s premier showcase for independent film is also in a time of profound transition after decades of relative stability. The festival is bidding farewell to its longtime home and forging forward without its founder, Robert Redford, who died in September. Next year, it must find its footing in another mountain town, Boulder, Colorado.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise that legacy will be a through-line at this year\u2019s final edition in Park City. There will be screenings of restored Sundance gems like \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d \u201cMysterious Skin,\u201d \u201cHouse Party\u201d and \u201cHumpday\u201d as well as Redford\u2019s first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama \u201cDownhill Racer.\u201d Many will also pay tribute to Redford at the institute\u2019s fundraising event, where honorees include Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Ed Harris and Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201cSundance has always been about showcasing and fostering independent movies in America. Without that, so many filmmakers wouldn\u2019t have had the careers they have,\u201d said \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d filmmaker Gregg Araki. He first attended the festival in 1992 and has been back many times, including at the labs where Zhao was one of his students.",
      "Quite a few festival veterans are planning to make the trip, including \u201cNavalny\u201d filmmaker Daniel Roher. His first Sundance in 2022 might have been a bit unconventional (made fully remote at the last minute due to the pandemic) but ended on a high note with an Oscar. This year he\u2019s back with two films, his narrative debut \u201cTuner,\u201d and the world premiere of \u201cThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,\u201d which he co-directed with Charlie Tyrell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going through a weird moment in the world \u2026 There\u2019s something that strikes me about an institution that has been evergreen, that seems so entrenched going through its own transition and rebirth,\u201d Roher told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m choosing to frame this year as a celebration of Sundance and the institute and a future that will ensure the festival goes on forever and ever and ever and stays the vital conduit for so many filmmakers that it has been.\u201d",
      "Over the past four decades, countless careers have been shaped and boosted by the festival and the Institute. Three of this year\u2019s presumed Oscar nominees \u2014 Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryan Coogler and Zhao \u2014 are among those the Institute supported early in their careers.",
      "Jay Duplass, who first came to Sundance in 2003 with his brother, Mark, with what he calls a \u201c$3 film\u201d said it was the place where his career was made.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d probably be a psychologist right now if it wasn\u2019t for Sundance,\u201d Duplass said.",
      "While he\u2019s been to \u201cprobably 15 Sundances\u201d since, it hasn\u2019t lost its luster. In fact, when a programmer called him to tell him that his new film \u201cSee You When I See You\u201d was selected, he cried. The film is based on a memoir in which a young comedy writer (Cooper Raiff) attempts to process the death of his sister (Kaitlyn Dever). It's one of many films that finds humor amid grim subjects.",
      "As always, the lineup is full of starry films as well, including Cathy Yan\u2019s art world satire, \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d starring Portman, Jenna Ortega, Sterling K. Brown, Zach Galifianakis and Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph. The romantic drama \u201cCarousel,\u201d from Rachel Lambert, features Chris Pine and Jenny Slate as high school exes who rekindle their romance later in life. Araki is also bringing a new film, \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d in which Olivia Wilde plays a provocative artist (Araki described as a cross between Madonna and Robert Mapplethorpe) who takes on Cooper Hoffman as her younger muse.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a sex-positive love letter to Gen Z,\u201d Araki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a comedy. It has elements of mystery, thriller, murder \u2014 a little bit of \u2018Sunset Boulevard\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it's sexy. It's a ride.\u201d",

      "Araki, like Redford, knew long ago that the festival had outgrown Park City. It will be strange to no longer have its iconic locations like Egyptian Theatre and Eccles and The Ray anymore, but it's also just a place.",

      "Prince Harry's legal battle against British tabloids has entered its final round",
      "LONDON -- The third and final round in Prince Harry 's battle with the British tabloids began Monday with his lawyer alleging that the Daily Mail and its sister Sunday newspaper engaged in a \u201cclear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\u201d for two decades.",
      "Attorney David Sherborne said a longstanding culture of hiring private investigators who practiced \u201cdark arts\u201d to spy on celebrities for scoops had left Harry distressed and isolated.",
      "It was \u201cdisturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\u201d Harry said, according to his lawyer\u2019s written opening statement.",
      "The intrusions were \u201cterrifying\u201d for his loved ones, created a \u201cmassive strain\u201d on his personal relationships, and the distrust and suspicion they caused left Harry \u201cparanoid beyond belief,\u201d Sherborne said.",
      "Tens of millions of dollars are on the line in the privacy invasion case in which the Duke of Sussex is joined by Elton John, actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, and others who claim the publisher of the Mail hired private investigators to bug their cars, obtain their personal records and eavesdrop on phone calls.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included \u201cleaky\u201d associates willing to dish dirt on their famous friends.",
      "The trial in London\u2019s High Court is expected to last nine weeks and will see the return of Harry to the witness box Thursday for the second time since he made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior member of the royal family to testify in more than a century.",
      "Harry, wearing a dark blue suit, cheerfully waved at reporters as he entered the court building via a side entrance. He took a seat in the back row of the courtroom near Hurley and Frost as John watched the proceedings online.",
      "The case in the High Court follows two cases Harry brought against the other major tabloids that grew out of the widespread phone hacking scandal in which some journalists intercepted voicemail messages around the turn of this century.",
      "Harry won a court judgment in 2023 that condemned the publishers of the Daily Mirror for \u201cwidespread and habitual\u201d interception of phone messages. Last year, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s flagship U.K. tabloid made an unprecedented apology for intruding on Harry\u2019s life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. He also said persistent press attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White said the lawsuits were based on weak inferences by trying to connect articles to payments made to investigators.",
      "But he said witnesses, from editors to reporters who have worked for the newspapers for decades, were \u201clining up\u201d to dispute the allegations and explain their sources, which he said were often very close the subjects of the articles.",
      "\u201cThis is in reality little more than guesswork \u2014 it involves jumping to conclusions based on insufficient evidence, or worse, artificially selecting and presenting evidence to fit the preconceived agenda,\u201d White wrote in his opening statement. \u201cIt also ignores the fact that references in articles to a \u2018friend\u2019, or similar, as a source can be accurate.\u201d",

The Walt Disney Co. also celebrated another win as their Thanksgiving release \u201cZootopia 2\u201d became the highest grossing animated Motion Picture Association release of all time.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cThe Bone Temple,\u201d directed by Nia DaCosta, landed in second place with $13 million through Sunday. By the end of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, it's expected to be at $15 million, still trailing \u201cAvatar's\u201d projected $17.2 million.

      "Musicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey.",
      "Several asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia and bass guitarist Phil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024.",

      "The Bay Area native joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old.

      "The Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia\u2019s death, morphing into Dead & Company with John Mayer.",
      "Darla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next.",

      "China's one-child policy led to harsh measures like forced abortions and sterilizations",
      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",
      "China's leaders saw unbridled population growth as a potential threat in 1980 \u2014 to both economic development and its ability to feed what had grown into a nation of 1 billion people.",
      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",

      "A Portland, Oregon, boy is struggling to recover from infant botulism after drinking contaminated ByHeart baby formula donated through a program that aims to help poor and homeless families.",
      "Ashaan Carter, now 10 months old, was hospitalized twice and remains on a feeding tube after contracting the dangerous infection that has sickened more than 50 babies across the U.S.",
      "His mother, Angel Carter, said she received a can of ByHeart formula from a case worker with the Oregon Department of Human Services in early November, days before a nationwide recall of the product.",
      "Carter, who receives state food and housing assistance, said she had been exclusively breastfeeding her son, but her milk supply was waning. The case worker told the 27-year-old that the ByHeart formula \u201cwas closest to breast milk\u201d and could help, she said.",
      "\u201cI accepted it thinking, \u2018OK, I\u2019m hoping my baby can get on a bottle,'\" Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s been all downhill since then.\u201d",
      "State officials wouldn\u2019t comment on Carter\u2019s case, but they acknowledged that the agency received ByHeart formula from PDX Diaper Bank. That was one of nearly two dozen nonprofit groups nationwide who are part of ByHeart\u2019s \u201cOpenHearted Initiative\u201d that donated formula to \u201cfamilies in need,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Since June 2022, nearly 24,000 cans of formula have been distributed to groups that aid homeless and other vulnerable families, the company said. All the company's products have been recalled since production began in March 2022 because of potential contamination.",
      "Soon after consuming the ByHeart formula, Ashaan developed severe constipation and muscle weakness, becoming so limp that he couldn\u2019t move his head, Carter said.",
      "After a trip to an emergency room, he was sent to Randall Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland. Doctors there diagnosed him with presumed infant botulism tied to the ByHeart formula, according to Dr. Sylvia Peterson-Perry, a family medicine doctor who delivered Ashaan and cares for him and his mother.",
      "He was treated with BabyBIG, an IV medication that provides antibodies to the infection to stop the progress of the disease.",
      "Ashaan was hospitalized for nearly two weeks in November and discharged without a feeding tube. His health rapidly declined, including dramatic weight loss, and he was hospitalized again in December. He got so sick that his mother was afraid he would die.",
      "\u201cHe was just withering away,\u201d Carter said.",

      "No new cases of infant botulism tied to the outbreak have been reported since Dec. 17, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has conducted inspections at ByHeart plants, but has released no information about the source of the outbreak. Production remains shut down.",
      "Seattle food safety lawyer Bill Marler said Carter is one of more than 30 families he represents whose babies were sickened by ByHeart products.

      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters takes effect Saturday",
      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters took effect Saturday, marking a historic moment for ocean conservation after nearly two decades of negotiations.",
      "The High Seas Treaty will govern nearly half the planet\u2019s surface \u2013 the vast ocean areas beyond any country\u2019s control. These waters face mounting threats from destructive fishing practices, shipping, plastic pollution, overfishing and potential deep sea mining, all compounded by climate change. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making its health critical for addressing the climate crisis.",
      "The treaty entered into force 120 days after it reached the threshold of ratification by 60 countries in September. As of Friday, 83 countries had ratified it, including the recent addition of major maritime powers such as China and Japan.",
      "The treaty creates the first framework for establishing Marine Protected Areas on the high seas, which make up about two-thirds of the world\u2019s ocean. Currently, only around 1% of these international waters are protected.",
      "From Saturday, ratifying countries must begin working together on ocean science and technology as well as help developing nations build capacity to participate in ocean governance. Companies planning activities that could harm marine life must conduct environmental impact assessments that meet the treaty\u2019s standards. Those conducting research on ocean organisms that could be used commercially, such as for new medicines, must notify other countries and share their findings.",
      "Perhaps most significantly, countries must now promote the treaty\u2019s conservation goals when they participate in other international bodies that regulate ocean activities, such as regional fisheries organizations, the International Maritime Organization and the International Seabed Authority.",
      "While key institutions like the treaty\u2019s secretariat and scientific body are still being developed, countries can begin preparing proposals for Marine Protected Areas immediately. Potential sites include the Emperor Seamounts in the North Pacific, the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic and the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges off South America.",
      "Conservationists warn governments must act quickly to achieve the global goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 \u2013 a target scientists say is critical for ocean health. Because the high seas make up such a vast portion of the oceans, their protection is essential to reaching that goal.",
      "\u201cThe marine protected areas under the treaty will only be as strong as the governments make them,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for Greenpeace\u2019s Ocean Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust big fishing industry players to simply stop fishing in these critical ecosystems. We need governments to use the treaty to force their hands.\u201d",
      "How those protected areas will actually be monitored and enforced is undecided. Countries are exploring various options, from satellite technology to coordinating patrols between multiple nations to using other UN agencies to help with oversight, said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. Those details will be worked out as the first protected areas take shape.",
      "Within a year, the treaty\u2019s first Conference of Parties will meet to decide key operational details, from budgets to the makeup of various committees. Countries have been working through many of those questions at preparatory meetings, with a final session scheduled for late March. The earliest any Marine Protected Areas could actually win approval would be at the second COP, since the scientific body that will review proposals hasn\u2019t yet been established.",

      "U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack in a blunt statement Tuesday said the SDF\u2019s role as Syria's primary anti-IS force \u201chas largely expired\" since the new government is \"both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities.\u201d The U.S. is not interested in \"prolonging a separate SDF role,\u201d he said.",
      "As al-Sharaa sought to pull the country together after 14 years of civil war, he and SDF leader Mazloum Abdi in March 2025 agreed that the SDF's tens of thousands of fighters would be integrated into the new army. The government would take over key institutions in northeast Syria, including border crossings, oil fields and detention centers housing thousands of suspected IS members.",

      "Ahmad with the Kurdish-led administration accused Damascus officials of dodging meetings and said those that occurred \"were only possible because of the Americans pushing Damascus to come and join.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Love is, famously, a many-splendored thing. It can encompass longing, loneliness, pain, jealousy, grief \u2014 and, sometimes, joy.",
      "As Valentine\u2019s Day approaches, the many facets of passion are going on display in an exhibition called \u201cLove Letters\u201d at Britain\u2019s National Archives that covers five centuries.",
      "Curator Victoria Iglikowski-Broad said that the documents recount \u201clegendary romances from British history\u201d involving royalty, politicians, celebrities and spies, \u201calongside voices of everyday people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to open up the potential of what a love letter can be,\u201d she told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cExpressions of love can be found in all sorts of places, and surprising places.\u201d",
      "They also take many forms. The exhibition ranges from early 20th-century classified ads seeking same-sex romance to sweethearts' letters to soldiers at war and a medieval song about heartbreak.",
      "There\u2019s also \u201cone of our most iconic documents,\u201d Iglikowski-Broad said, referring to a poignant letter to Queen Elizabeth I from her suitor Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.",
      "Written days before Dudley\u2019s death in 1588, it conveys the intimacy between the \u201cVirgin Queen,\u201d who never married, and the man who called himself \u201cyour poor old servant.\u201d",
      "The missive, with \u201chis last lettar\u201d written on the outside \u2014 spelling at the time was idiosyncratic \u2014 was found at the queen\u2019s bedside when she died almost 15 years later.",
      "Love, in the exhibition, doesn\u2019t just mean romance. Family bonds are in evidence in Jane Austen\u2019s handwritten will from 1817 leaving almost everything to her beloved sister Cassandra, and in a 1956 letter in which the father of London gangster twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray, implores a court to go easy on the brothers, because \u201call their concern in life is to do good to everybody.\u201d",
      "The letter writers range from paupers to princes. In an 1851 petition, an unemployed 71-year-old weaver named Daniel Rush begs authorities not to separate him and his wife by sending them to workhouses. It\u2019s displayed alongside the Instrument of Abdication through which King Edward VIII gave up the throne in 1936 so that he could marry \u201cthe woman I love,\u201d twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of connection in these two items even though on the surface they seem very different,\u201d Iglikowski-Broad said. \u201cIn common they have just this human feeling of love \u2026 that the sacrifice is actually worth it for love.\u201d",
      "Other documents tell of love lost. There is a never-before-displayed 1944 letter from young British intelligence officer John Cairncross to his former girlfriend Gloria Barraclough, reflecting on what might have been. \u201cWould we have broken off, I wondered, if we had known what was coming?\u201d",

      "French far-right leader Marine Le Pen acknowledged a \"mistake\" at a key appeals trial in Paris",
      "PARIS -- French far-right leader Marine Le Pen acknowledged \u201ca mistake\u201d on Wednesday at an appeals trial hearing in Paris that could derail her presidential ambitions, but firmly denied accusations she was at the center of a fraudulent system to siphon off European Union funds.",
      "Le Pen, 57, is seeking to overturn a March 2025 ruling that found her guilty of misusing EU Parliament funds in the hiring of aides from 2004 to 2016.",
      "She acknowledged some people paid as EU parliamentary aides performed work for her party, then known as the National Front, during that period.",
      "\u201cThe mistake lies here: there were certainly some aides, on a case-by-case basis, who must have worked either marginally, more substantially, or entirely \u2026 for the benefit of the party. And voil\u00e0,\u201d Le Pen told the three-judge panel.",
      "The five-week trial that started last week could significantly impact France\u2019s political landscape. The appeals court is expected to issue its ruling before the summer.",
      "Last March, Le Pen was given a five-year ban from holding elected office, two years of house arrest with an electronic bracelet and a further two-year suspended sentence for having violated the 27-nation bloc\u2019s regulations.",
      "A Paris court ruled that she was at the heart of \u201ca fraudulent system\u201d that her party used to siphon off EU Parliament funds worth 2.9 million euros ($3.4 million). The ruling described the embezzlement as \u201ca democratic bypass\u201d unfair to competitors.",
      "If she\u2019s ruled able to run, Le Pen is expected to be among the top contenders in the 2027 presidential election. If she\u2019s ineligible, she has designated her 30-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jordan Bardella, as her successor in the presidential bid.",
      "During intense questioning on Wednesday, Le Pen firmly denied the existence of \u201ca system\u201d meant to hire party workers with EU funds. Calm and steady, she insisted her party never committed any illegal move on purpose.",

It has raided firms suspected of colluding to secure army contracts, arrested senior officers and seized millions of ringgit in cash, luxury goods and frozen bank accounts believed tied to defence contracts.",

      "The utility that operates the Fukushima plant that melted down in 2011 restarted a reactor at the world\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, which it also operates in north-central Japan",
      "TOKYO -- The world\u2019s largest nuclear power plant restarted Wednesday in north-central Japan for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown, as resource-poor Japan accelerates atomic power use to meet soaring electricity needs.",
      "The first steps in energy production at the No. 6 reactor of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant are important because the operator is Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, the same utility that runs the ruined Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO's past safety issues at Fukushima have led to public worries about operations at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, which also sits in an isolated, quake-prone region.",
      "TEPCO said staff at the No. 6 reactor\u2019s control room turned on a button Wednesday evening to start a nuclear chain reaction toward achieving criticality \u2014 a stage when a reactor reaches a self-sustaining nuclear reaction. The move was delayed a day due to a faulty alarm setting found over the weekend.",
      "All seven reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa have been dormant since a year after the Fukushima Daiichi plant on Japan\u2019s northeastern coast was hit by a massive quake and tsunami in March 2011 and suffered meltdowns that contaminated the surrounding land with radioactive fallout so severe that some areas are still unlivable.",
      "TEPCO is still trying to recover from the hit to its image, even as it works on a cleanup at Fukushima Daiichi that's estimated to cost 22 trillion yen ($139 billion). Government and independent investigations blamed the Fukushima debacle on TEPCO's bad safety culture and criticized it for collusion with safety authorities.",
      "Fourteen other nuclear reactors have restarted across Japan since 2011, but this is the first TEPCO-run unit to resume production.",
      "Residents near the plant welcome the potential economic and employment benefits but worry about nuclear safety and the feasibility of evacuation plans, especially after a major quake in the nearby Noto region two years ago.",
      "A restart of the No. 6 reactor at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) northwest of Tokyo, could generate an additional 1.35 million kilowatts of electricity, enough to power more than 1 million households in the capital region.",
      "All seven units were taken offline in 2012 as part of nationwide safety shutdowns after the Fukushima disaster, though they were unaffected by that quake and tsunami.",
      "The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant was partially damaged in a 2007 earthquake, causing safety worries and distrust among locals. TEPCO responded by installing a quake-resistant command center at the compound in 2009.",
      "No. 6 was one of the two reactors that had cleared safety tests in 2017, but faced an operational ban by the Nuclear Regulation Authority over serious safeguarding problems found in 2021. It finally got a greenlight in 2023.",
      "The restart follows revelations of seismic data falsification by another utility during safety screenings of one of its reactors. That has angered regulation officials and shaken public confidence.",
      "Under a government draft evacuation plan, about 18,600 residents within a 5-kilometer (3-mile) radius of the plant would need to evacuate if there were radiation leak worries, while about 400,000 others in a wider zone would be asked to stay indoors.",

      "Danish veterans feel betrayed as the U.S. escalates threats to seize Greenland, a territory of Denmark",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- More than 15 years ago, Danish platoon commander Martin Tamm Andersen was leading his countrymen and U.S. Marines through the heat and sand of southern Afghanistan after a Taliban attack.",
      "As Andersen\u2019s vehicle moved at the rear of the column, everything was normal \u2014 until in one instant the world turned sand-colored. His body shook violently. \u201cI had no idea what was going on,\u201d he recalled. He ran his hands over his arms and legs to make sure they were still there.",
      "When the dust settled, he saw one of his soldiers bleeding heavily from his face. Another had been hurled from the turret and lay on the ground, groaning in pain, his back broken in two places. The blast had torn the vehicle apart.",
      "Andersen called in help from the U.S. Marines, who halted a firefight with the Taliban, returned to secure the site, treated the wounded and helped prepare them for evacuation.",
      "At the time, American and Danish troops were comrades in arms who risked their lives for each other in common cause.",
      "Andersen can barely believe what has come of the U.S.-Danish alliance today as President Donald Trump escalates his threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark. Trump has repeatedly said the United States must take control of the strategically located and mineral-rich island, and views force as one way to get it.",
      "\u201cWhen America needed us after 9/11 we were there,\u201d the 46-year-old veteran said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAs a veteran and as a Dane, you know, you feel sad and very surprised that the U.S. wants to take over part of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a betrayal of the loyalty of our nation to the U.S. and to our common alliance, NATO.\u201d",
      "He spoke from the Danish War Museum in Copenhagen, where his armored personnel carrier that hit the improvised explosive device in 2010 in Helmand Province is on display.",
      "Before his deployment to Afghanistan, Andersen had also served in Iraq. Good friends were killed and wounded in both wars. He believed his service in the U.S. wars served the cause of freedom and democracy.",
      "As the U.S. intensifies its threats to seize Greenland, that initial shock felt by many across Europe has evolved into a profound sense of sadness, betrayal and fear of what such a move could mean for Europe\u2019s security at a time of Russian aggression. Denmark\u2019s prime minster has said it would mean the end of NATO.",
      "For Danish veterans, it feels profoundly personal.",
      "A NATO member since 1949, Denmark has been a stalwart ally to America. Forty-four Danish soldiers were killed in Afghanistan, the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces. Eight more died in Iraq.",
      "\u201cIt feels surreal. It feels like it\u2019s a bad joke somehow,\u201d Andersen said. \" I mean, you can\u2019t really fathom that this is actually something that is being said out loud. It just seems too crazy.\u201d",
      "S\u00f8ren Knudsen, a Danish veteran who served twice in Afghanistan, was watching television last year when he heard U.S. Vice President JD Vance say on Fox News that Denmark was \u201cnot being a good ally.\u201d Vance was making Trump\u2019s argument that the United States needed to take more \u201dterritorial interest\u201d in Greenland for the sake of U.S. security, and accusing Denmark of \u201cnot doing its job.\"",
      "He could not believe it. In his Copenhagen home, the 65-year-old Knudsen keeps a photo of himself flanked by children in the Afghan city of Qalat. The mission, as Knudsen understood it at the time, was to help the Americans safeguard the future of Afghanistan's youth. At the end of his second tour, U.S. service members gave him an American flag as a parting gift.",

      "Iran's foreign minister has issued a direct threat against the United States, warning of retaliation if attacked",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's foreign minister issued the most direct threat yet Wednesday against the United States after Tehran's bloody crackdown on protesters, warning the Islamic Republic will be \u201cfiring back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack.\"",
      "The comments by Abbas Araghchi, who saw his invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos rescinded over the killings, comes as an American aircraft carrier group moves westward toward the Middle East from Asia. American fighter jets and other equipment appears to be moving in the Mideast after a major U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean saw troops seize Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Meanwhile, an Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq claimed Iran targeted one of its bases in a drone and missile attack that killed at least one fighter. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the attack, which would be the first foreign operation Tehran has launched since the protests started.",
      "Araghchi made the threat in an opinion article published by The Wall Street Journal. In it, the foreign minister contended \u201cthe violent phase of the unrest lasted less than 72 hours\u201d and sought again to blame armed demonstrators for the violence. Videos that have slipped out of Iran despite an internet shutdown appear to show security forces repeatedly using live fire to target apparently unarmed protesters, something unaddressed by Araghchi.",
      "\u201cUnlike the restraint Iran showed in June 2025, our powerful armed forces have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack,\u201d Araghchi wrote, referring to the 12-day war launched by Israel on Iran in June. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a threat, but a reality I feel I need to convey explicitly, because as a diplomat and a veteran, I abhor war.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAn all-out confrontation will certainly be ferocious and drag on far, far longer than the fantasy timelines that Israel and its proxies are trying to peddle to the White House. It will certainly engulf the wider region and have an impact on ordinary people around the globe.\u201d",
      "Araghchi's comments likely refer to Iran's short- and medium-range missiles. The Islamic Republic relied on ballistic missiles to target Israel in the war and left its stockpile of the shorter-range missiles unused, something that could be fired to target American bases and interests in the Persian Gulf. Already, there have been some restrictions on U.S. diplomats traveling to American bases in both Kuwait and Qatar.",

      "While naval and other defense officials stopped short of saying the carrier strike group was headed to the Middle East, its current heading and location in the Indian Ocean means it is only days away from moving into the region. Meanwhile, U.S. military images released in recent days showed F-15E Strike Eagles arriving in the Mideast and forces in the region moving a HIMARS missile system, the type used with great success by Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in the country in 2022.",

The PAK has claimed it launched attacks in Iran as a crackdown on the demonstrations took place, something reported by semiofficial Iranian news agencies as well.",

The agency has been accurate throughout the years on demonstrations and unrest in Iran, relying on a network of activists inside the country that confirms all reported fatalities. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll.",
      "The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution that brought the Islamic Republic into being. Although there have been no protests for days, there are fears the death toll could increase significantly as information gradually emerges from a country still under a government-imposed shutdown of the internet since Jan. 8.",

      "Veterinarians and volunteers in Chile are racing to help animals affected by devastating fires",
      "LIRQU\u00c9N, Chile -- Some are frightened, others are dehydrated, most are burned. In order to provide aid to the furry friends and other animals affected by the raging fires in Chile, the national police's canine brigade and teams of volunteers are working against the clock to provide first aid to the pets caught by flames.",
      "\u201cOur main goal is to help animals that have been rescued, found in the rubble, in the ash, or that managed to escape with their owners but suffered injuries due to this massive fire,\u201d Angiella Scalpello, a veterinarian from the canine squad of the investigative police, told The Associated Press.",
      "Inside a small van, Scalpello and other veterinarians are treating cats, dogs and other animals in a makeshift clinic. Almost all of them arrive with burned whiskers and paws, thirsty or suffering from conjunctivitis \u2014 caused by the toxic fumes \u2014 after spending days under the debris of what once were houses, vehicles or schools.",
      "The small town of Lirqu\u00e9n in south-central Chile was ground zero for the devastating fires that have been burning for days. With around 20,000 inhabitants, the fire consumed 80% of the city. Nationwide, the fires have left at least 20 dead and nearly 300 injured, official data shows.",
      "Many of the furry patients treated in the mobile unit were found in the aftermath of the deadly fires.",
      "\u201cWe usually find cats that were sheltering in small corners and that survived both the fire and the days that followed,\u201d said veterinarian Juan Vivanco, who also works in the unit.",
      "Although the blaze is for now under control in Lirqu\u00e9n, the strong smell of burning and fine ash dust still cover its narrow streets. While the town assesses the damage and debris removal efforts continue, more animals are expected to be rescued in the coming days, according to Vivanco.",
      "But the longer they wait, the less likely they are to survive. \u201cWe\u2019ve also found several pets already deceased\u2026 it happens regularly,\u201d he said.",
      "Once they arrive at the mobile unit, the pets receive IV fluids, a vital signs checkup and have their wounds taken care of. The most severe cases are sent to veterinary hospitals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve transported four or five puppies, in addition to three kittens. The last kitten we brought in yesterday (Monday) really touched us, because it had all four paws and its tail burned,\u201d said volunteer Vanessa Morales. \u201cWe took it to an emergency center.\u201d",
      "Many residents also go to the mobile clinic seeking help for their pets who are suffering from stress or injuries.",

However, the senior poodle began to experience some discomfort in her eyes, so her owner Kevin Carrasco decided to seek professional help.",

      "A Japanese court sentenced a man who admitted assassinating former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to life imprisonment",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese court sentenced a man who admitted assassinating former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to life imprisonment on Wednesday. The case has revealed decades of cozy ties between Japan\u2019s governing party and a controversial South Korean church.",
      "Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, earlier pleaded guilty to killing Abe in July 2022 during his election campaign speech in the western city of Nara.",
      "Abe, one of Japan\u2019s most influential politicians, was serving as a regular lawmaker after leaving the prime minister's job when he was killed in 2022 while campaigning in the western city of Nara. It shocked a nation with strict gun control.",
      "Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, pleaded guilty to murder in the trial that started in October. The Nara District Court announced Wednesday that it had issued a guilty verdict and sentenced Yamagami to life in prison, as prosecutors requested.",
      "Yamagami said he killed Abe after seeing a video message the former leader sent to a group affiliated with the Unification Church. He added that his goal was to hurt the church, which he hated, and expose its ties with Abe, investigators have said.",
      "Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment for Yamagami, while his lawyers sought a sentence of no more than 20 years, citing his troubles as the child of a church adherent. Japanese law authorizes the death penalty in murder cases, but prosecutors do not usually request it unless at least two people are killed.",
      "The revelation of close ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the church caused the party to pull back from the church. It also prompted investigations that ended with a court decision that stripped the church's Japanese branch of its tax-exempt religious status and ordered it dissolved. The church has since appealed, pending a decision.",
      "The killing also led the National Police Agency to increase police protection of dignitaries.",

      "Yamagami was captured on the spot. He said he initially planned to kill the leader of the Unification Church, but switched targets to Abe because of the difficulty of getting close to the leader.",

      "A national security trial for former organizers of Hong Kong\u2019s Tiananmen Square vigil opens Thursday",
      "HONG KONG -- Two former leaders of a Hong Kong pro-democracy group that for decades organized a vigil commemorating people killed during Beijing\u2019s 1989 Tiananmen crackdown are set to stand trial in a case brought under a national security law that has all but silenced dissent in the city.",
      "A third co-defendant is expected to plead guilty at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Observers say the disappearance of the only large-scale public commemoration of the 1989 crackdown within China is part of a decline in Western-style civil liberties, which Beijing promised to maintain for 50 years when it took control of the former British colony in 1997.",
      "The government said its law enforcement actions were evidence-based and strictly in accordance with the law.",
      "Chow Hang-tung, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, former leaders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, were charged with incitement to subversion in September 2021 under a law imposed by China following massive anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "The Hong Kong Alliance voted to disband weeks after its leaders were charged under the law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the case:",
      "The 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, led by students, posed one of the most significant challenges to the Communist Party\u2019s rule in China. They ended after the Chinese government sent tanks into Beijing, with troops opening fire in a bloody crackdown that killed hundreds, possibly thousands.",
      "The crackdown has long been a taboo topic in mainland China, but for 30 years the alliance held annual vigils in Hong Kong. The gathering drew tens of thousands to commemorate the victims with a sea of candles until authorities banned it during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt was a group that aimed to seek justice,\u201d former alliance member Tang Ngok-kwan told The Associated Press in early January. Tang, who was a senior member of the group, was charged alongside Chow in another case related to the group.",
      "Tang said he felt a moral burden about the deaths, because he thought the city\u2019s financial support for the movement may have fueled the demonstrators\u2019 conflict with authorities.",
      "Some young people stayed away from the vigil during a rise in localism in the 2010s, deeming the alliance\u2019s goal of building a democratic China irrelevant to Hong Kong. But the last vigil in 2019 drew an estimated 180,000 people days before the city erupted in monthslong protests.",
      "After the pandemic, the former vigil site hosted a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products during the anniversary of the crackdown. Some residents who commemorated the event nearby were detained.",
      "The alliance was one of dozens of civil society groups disbanded during a crackdown that started when Beijing imposed a National Security Law to quell protests.",
      "Other people affected include former pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was convicted of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces in December and faces up to life in prison.",
      "The Hong Kong Alliance came under increasing pressure in 2021 after police opened an investigation, saying they had reasonable grounds to believe the group was acting as a foreign agent. The group rejected the allegations and refused to cooperate. Chow, Ho and Lee were charged in September 2021, and later that month the alliance\u2019s members voted to disband.",

      "New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced a national election will be held Nov. 7",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand will hold a national election on Nov. 7, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced Wednesday.",
      "Luxon, the leader of a center-right government, will seek a second term in office, with the election likely to be a ballot on whether his pledges to improve the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic have gained enough traction to convince voters still struggling with living and housing costs. The main center-left opposition Labour Party, lead by Chris Hipkins, has regained support since its poor showing in the previous 2023 election and analysts forecast a tight race.",
      "New Zealand elections are held every three years with the government selecting the exact date. Voters choose which party they prefer to see in government and also select a local candidate to represent their constituency in Parliament.",
      "The country of 5 million people has a unicameral parliament, which means governments are powerful deciders of how the country operates. The National Party and Labour usually must form coalitions with smaller parties to hold a majority in parliament, giving the minor parties unusual sway in which major party leads.",
      "Announcing the election date at a retreat for his party\u2019s lawmakers in the city of Christchurch on Wednesday, Luxon underlined what he said was his party\u2019s track record on working to rebuild a post-pandemic economy. Days earlier in a speech to a business audience in Auckland on Monday, he acknowledged that reversing the country\u2019s fortunes had not been simple and that many New Zealanders have endured \u201ctwo years of hard grind.\u201d",
      "The economy has contracted a further 0.5 percentage point in the most recently measured 12 months, and migration to neighboring, wealthier Australia has at times hit record highs during Luxon\u2019s tenure. Luxon on Monday blamed the former Labour-led government for the country\u2019s woes, saying he had \u201cinherited a mess.\u201d",
      "Analysts said that with inflation trending down and business confidence beginning to grow, Luxon will hope the months until this year\u2019s election will be long enough to convince New Zealanders that the economic reversal he pledged in 2023 is taking root.",
      "Hipkins, his main challenger to lead the country, on Monday dismissed Luxon\u2019s remarks as \u201ca whole lot of management-speak mumbo-jumbo.\u201d The opposition leader added that Luxon hadn\u2019t delivered on political promises he had made, including making housing more affordable in what has been one of the world\u2019s hottest markets and ensuring access to public health care for all.",
      "Paying for the country\u2019s ailing infrastructure and how to fund pensions will also be central economic issues. Luxon decries Labour\u2019s approach as one reliant on accruing national debt, while Hipkins said Monday that National had squandered money on unaffordable tax cuts.",
      "An unusual quirk of the election is that the premiership will once again be contested by two men named Christopher, as it was in 2023. Luxon, 55, is still a relative newcomer to politics, making a rapid ascent to National party leader in 2021 after entering parliament as a constituency lawmaker at the 2020 election.",
      "The millionaire former business executive was the head of the national carrier Air New Zealand before turning to politics and previously worked as an executive for Unilever when he lived in the United States. Luxon pledged to bring managerial experience, but his detractors highlight his political inexperience and say his wealth means he is out of touch with ordinary New Zealanders.",

The 47-year-old, who presents himself as a humble man from an ordinary background, briefly became prime minister in 2023 when incumbent leader Jacinda Ardern abruptly quit, citing exhaustion.",
      "Labour was already flagging in the polls and Hipkins was unable to reverse the party\u2019s fortunes, with a dismal result ushering in Luxon\u2019s center-right government. Critics of Hipkins on the left decry him for being too timid, while those on the right often seek to remind voters of his role in Ardern\u2019s government as its strict COVID-19 lockdowns lost public confidence in some parts of the country.",
      "Under New Zealand\u2019s proportional voting system, political parties must generally form alliances to govern. That makes the votes won by smaller parties crucial to the outcome. Following the election, whichever major party holds the most votes begins negotiations with their traditional governing parties, with minor party leaders sometimes extracting steep policy concessions to secure their support.",
      "Luxon\u2019s government was formed with the libertarian ACT party and populist New Zealand First. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First and current foreign minister, is New Zealand\u2019s longest-serving current lawmaker and has crowned both National and Labour governments before \u2014 but has animosity with Labour and Hipkins after their last period in government together.",

The M\u0101ori party too has sided with both National and Labour governments before, but has supported Labour more recently.",

      "There's a lot more to The New York Times than its news stories, and that's by design",
      "For subscribers to The New York Times who are as interested in solving Wordle or filling in the crossword puzzle as in reading the latest political or business news, Wednesday is a big day.",
      "The Times' popular Games unit is debuting Crossplay, a Scrabble-like electronic feature that represents its first designed multiplayer game. It becomes the website's 11th game, joining a lineup of puzzles that were collectively played over 11.2 billion times in 2025.",
      "Ancillary products like Games, a cooking app and the Wirecutter product recommendations have fueled remarkable digital growth at The Times over the past decade.",
      "\u201cIt has been a huge boon to the journalism,\u201d said Dan Kennedy, a Northeastern University professor. The Times says it has about 3,000 journalists on staff, its most ever and more than twice what it had a decade ago. It is thriving at a troubled time for the industry: More than 350,000 journalists worked at U.S. newspapers in 2005, and it was down to 91,550 last year, according to Northwestern University.",
      "Kennedy tries the crossword puzzle \u2014 on its easiest day. His daughter is a Wordle devotee. They both love Wirecutter, which on Tuesday touted cat beds and a vibrator that doubled as a necklace. His wife regularly uses the Cooking app, where thousands of recipes for all occasions are available.",
      "\u201cAs remarkable as it's been, I kind of scratch my head at the other news organizations that have tried to replicate it,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt just seems like they were so thoroughly beaten to this idea that it's hard for them to compete.\u201d",
      "The Times likens itself to a solar system. The newspaper is the sun, with the other products the planets revolving around it.",
      "Some have jokingly referred to it as a game company that happens to have news. The research company YipitData reported in 2023 that subscribers spent more time in Games than it did with the digital newspaper (the company didn't respond to questions about whether it had more current data).",
      "The Times reported 12.33 million subscribers by the end of last September, up 9% from 2024 and all but about a half million of them digital. Subscription revenue for digital-only products increased by 14%. About half of Times subscribers buy a $30 monthly package that bundles all of its products, the rest buy portions of what it offers a la carte. Last year saw a decrease in people subscribing to just the news.",
      "\u201cI now get out of bed in the morning knowing that the work I do is advancing the mission that we have as a company \u2014 seek the truth, understand the world, keep the journalists independent and well-funded,\u201d said Jonathan Knight, the company's head of games. \u201cIf I can play a role in that, that's incredibly rewarding.\u201d",
      "Puzzles, contests and games aren't novel for newspapers; The Times introduced its crossword puzzle in 1942 and it went digital in 2009. It was late last decade when its spelling bee game proved popular, particularly among people intimidated by the crossword.",
      "Times executives realized the potential and rebranded its app in 2020. But the game-changer came in 2022.",
      "Developed by a Brooklyn software engineer named Josh Wardle, the addictive puzzle known as Wordle requires players to guess a five-letter word by eliminating potential letters. The fewer turns it takes, the better. Knight learned about it from colleagues who saw it online; he moved fast and bought the game from Wardle within weeks after first playing it.",

      "The BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE are two popular midsize luxury SUVs that offer the latest in luxury, space and technology. Of course, neither vehicle is aimed at the cost-conscious car shopper, but this is a situation where you do get what you pay for. They\u2019re also notable because they\u2019re among just a few luxury SUVs available with a plug-in hybrid powertrain.",
      "Getting an X5 or a GLE with a plug-in hybrid might be just what you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re looking to use less gas. These plug-in hybrids have hybrid batteries you can charge with a cord, enabling you to drive short distances on all-electric power. After that, they have a regular gas engine that\u2019s ready to go when the battery runs low. If you make a lot of drives that are less than 40 miles, and can frequently charge up the hybrid battery at home, you can save a lot on gas with these plug-in hybrids.",
      "It\u2019s an appealing proposition. But which plug-in hybrid, the BMW X5 xDrive50e or Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e, is the better buy? Edmunds\u2019 auto experts tested them both to find out.",

Seat heating, ventilation and massage functions combined with an excellent climate control system make for a truly relaxing drive. The back seat also offers ample room to accommodate bulky child safety seats, and the anchor points are conveniently located.",
      "The X5 has a similarly roomy interior that offers vault-like isolation from the outside world. Premium materials, near infinite seat adjustability, and LED ambient lighting add to the decidedly upscale vibe. The climate controls and other in-car functions can be frustrating to use, however, because many are buried in the touchscreen display\u2019s labyrinth of menus. We also found it more challenging to install child safety seats in the X5 because the anchor points are more difficult to access.",
      "Winner: Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e",
      "When the battery is charged up, the Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e mainly stays in electric mode, only firing up its gas engine when the driver asks for all of the vehicle\u2019s available power. When the engine does kick in, the transition feels seamless from behind the wheel. At Edmunds\u2019 test track, the GLE 450e accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds. Light steering makes the GLE 450e easy to maneuver in tight spots, but at higher speeds, it\u2019s not quite as planted as other versions of the GLE.",
      "The BMW X5 xDrive50e\u2019s hybrid system feels just as refined as the GLE\u2019s, but the BMW is noticeably sportier overall. The X5\u2019s powertrain generates gobs of power that push it to 60 mph in a brief 4.6 seconds. The X5 also feels more stable and secure around corners and along curvy roads.",
      "Winner: BMW X5 xDrive50e",
      "Sharp graphics and snappy response make the X5\u2019s infotainment system pleasant to use, but the menu layout can be difficult to navigate. Thankfully, BMW\u2019s voice controls are among the best in the industry, so commonly used functions, like changing the temperature of the air conditioning, can be performed without taking your eyes off the road.",
      "The GLE 450e\u2019s infotainment system also boasts high-resolution graphics and lightning-quick response times, but Mercedes-Benz has gone a step further with some genuinely impressive features that BMW doesn\u2019t offer. For example, an available augmented reality feature for the navigation system makes turn-by-turn directions easier to follow in the GLE by overlaying live video from the front camera with digital graphics like arrows and street names onto the central display.",

      "Both the Mercedes and BMW boast impeccable fit and finish as well as a four-year/50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. BMW sweetens the deal with three years of complimentary maintenance, but the GLE 450e wins back some points with efficiency. It is capable of an EPA-estimated 50 miles of all-electric range and then 23 mpg in combined city/highway driving when the battery is depleted. The X5 xDrive50e comes up a bit short with its estimated 38 miles of electric range and 22 mpg combined.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "The 2026 BMW X5 xDrive50e and 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e are both impressive luxury SUVs that offer plug-in hybrid power and efficiency. You might prefer the X5 if sporty driving is a priority, but otherwise the GLE is the better option due to its more serene comfort and exceptional build quality and easier-to-use technology.",

      "Iran's foreign minister has issued a direct threat against the United States, warning of retaliation if attacked",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's foreign minister issued the most direct threat yet Wednesday against the United States after Tehran's bloody crackdown on protesters, warning the Islamic Republic will be \u201cfiring back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack.\"",
      "The comments by Abbas Araghchi, who saw his invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos rescinded over the killings, comes as an American aircraft carrier group moves westward toward the Middle East from Asia. American fighter jets and other equipment appears to be moving in the Mideast after a major U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean saw troops seize Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Meanwhile, an Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq claimed Iran targeted one of its bases in a drone and missile attack that killed at least one fighter. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the attack, which would be the first foreign operation Tehran has launched since the protests started.",
      "Araghchi made the threat in an opinion article published by The Wall Street Journal. In it, the foreign minister contended \u201cthe violent phase of the unrest lasted less than 72 hours\u201d and sought again to blame armed demonstrators for the violence. Videos that have slipped out of Iran despite an internet shutdown appear to show security forces repeatedly using live fire to target apparently unarmed protesters, something unaddressed by Araghchi.",
      "\u201cUnlike the restraint Iran showed in June 2025, our powerful armed forces have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack,\u201d Araghchi wrote, referring to the 12-day war launched by Israel on Iran in June. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a threat, but a reality I feel I need to convey explicitly, because as a diplomat and a veteran, I abhor war.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAn all-out confrontation will certainly be ferocious and drag on far, far longer than the fantasy timelines that Israel and its proxies are trying to peddle to the White House. It will certainly engulf the wider region and have an impact on ordinary people around the globe.\u201d",
      "Araghchi's comments likely refer to Iran's short- and medium-range missiles. The Islamic Republic relied on ballistic missiles to target Israel in the war and left its stockpile of the shorter-range missiles unused, something that could be fired to target American bases and interests in the Persian Gulf. Already, there have been some restrictions on U.S. diplomats traveling to American bases in both Kuwait and Qatar.",
      "Mideast nations, particularly diplomats from Gulf Arab countries, had lobbied Trump not to attack. Last week, Iran shut its airspace, likely in anticipation of a strike.",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln, which had been in the South China Sea in recent days, had passed through the Strait of Malacca, a key waterway connecting the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, by Tuesday, ship-tracking data showed.",
      "A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the aircraft carrier and three accompanying destroyers were heading west.",
      "While naval and other defense officials stopped short of saying the carrier strike group was headed to the Middle East, its current heading and location in the Indian Ocean means it is only days away from moving into the region. Meanwhile, U.S. military images released in recent days showed F-15E Strike Eagles arriving in the Mideast and forces in the region moving a HIMARS missile system, the type used with great success by Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in the country in 2022.",

The PAK has claimed it launched attacks in Iran as a crackdown on the demonstrations took place, something reported by semiofficial Iranian news agencies as well.",
      "The death toll from the protests has reached at least 4,519 people, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said. The agency has been accurate throughout the years on demonstrations and unrest in Iran, relying on a network of activists inside the country that confirms all reported fatalities. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll.",
      "The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution that brought the Islamic Republic into being. Although there have been no protests for days, there are fears the death toll could increase significantly as information gradually emerges from a country still under a government-imposed shutdown of the internet since Jan. 8.",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that the protests had left \u201cseveral thousand\u201d people dead and blamed the United States. It was the first indication from an Iranian leader of the extent of the casualties.",

Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.",

      "\u201cMy sense is that Greg Abel\u2019s leadership style may be a departure from Buffett\u2019s, and this sale, if completed, would represent a shift in corporate mindset,\u201d Seifert said. \"Berkshire under Buffett typically only made acquisitions- not divestitures. It's not inconceivable, in our view, that Abel may likely assess every Berkshire subsidiary and decide to jettison those that do not meet his internal hurdles.\u201c",
      "Of course Abel already knows many of Berkshire's companies well because he has been managing all of the non-insurance companies since 2018. But he only became CEO on Jan. 1. Buffett remains chairman, but investors are watching closely for any changes Abel might make at the venerable conglomerate.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said \u201cselling Kraft is probably the most low-hanging fruit for Greg. We personally wouldn't be sad to see the holding go.\u201d",
      "But of course it would be bard for Berkshire to unload all of its shares on the public market because it is such a large stake, so Ballard said he wonders if there could be a large prospective buyer in the wings.",
      "But Buffett said last fall that Berkshire wouldn't accept a block bid for its shares unless the same offer was made to all Kraft Heinz shareholders.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Valentino Garavani\u2019s death cast a long shadow over the opening day of Paris Fashion Week menswear Tuesday, with front-row guests and industry figures mourning the passing of one of the last towering names of 20th-century couture \u2014 an Italian designer whose working life was closely entwined with the Paris runways.",
      "Valentino, 93, died at his Rome residence, the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said in a statement announcing his death. While he built his house in Rome, he spent decades presenting collections in France.",
      "He \u201cwas one of the last big couturiers who really embodied what was fashion in the 20th century,\u201d said Pierre Groppo, fashion editor-in-chief at Vanity Fair France.",
      "On a day meant to sell the future, many guests said they were thinking about what fashion has lost: the couturier as a living institution.",
      "Groppo pointed to the codes that made Valentino instantly legible \u2014 \u201cthe dots, the ruffles, the knots\u201d \u2014 and to a generation of designers who, he said, \u201cin a way, invented what is celebrity culture.\u201d",
      "Valentino\u2019s vision was built on a simple idea: make women look luminous, then make the moment unforgettable.",
      "He dressed Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor, among others, fixed his signature \u201cValentino red\u201d in the public imagination, and \u2014 through his decades-long partnership with Giancarlo Giammetti \u2014 helped turn the designer himself into part of the spectacle, as recognizable as the clients in his front row.",
      "Prominent fashion writer Luke Leitch framed the loss in similarly outsized terms, calling Valentino \u201cthe last of the fashion \u2018leviathans of that generation\u2019,\u201d and saying it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the end of a certain class of designer: figures whose names could carry a global house, and whose authority came not from viral speed but from permanence.",
      "Trained in Paris before founding his maison in Rome, Valentino became a rare bridge figure: Italian by origin, but fluent in the rituals that made Paris couture an institution. His career moved between those two capitals of elegance, bringing Roman grandeur into a system that still treats fashion not only as commerce, but as ceremony.",
      "Even as he aged, the house\u2019s founder kept turning up at its couture and ready-to-wear shows, as observed by one Associated Press journalist \u2014 until he eventually retreated from public life, all the while radiating quiet grandeur from his front-row seat.",
      "For some in Paris on Tuesday, the loss felt personal precisely because Valentino\u2019s world was never only Italian.",
      "Groppo recalled the designer as \u201cvery much more than a fashion brand,\u201d adding: \u201cIt was a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That lifestyle \u2014 couture polish, social glamour, and the conviction that elegance could be a form of power \u2014 remains a reference point even as fashion accelerates toward louder branding and faster cycles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad as he\u2019s so important to the fashion industry, and he contributed a lot and I cannot forget the stunning red he created,\u201d said Lolo Zhang, a Chinese fashion influencer attending Louis Vuitton \u2019s show in Paris.",
      "\u201cHe always celebrated pure beauty, and architecture for the silhouette, and how he used color. The old era just passed by.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to reshape the Federal Reserve board is putting the Supreme Court in a familiar position, weighing an emergency appeal from the president\u2019s lawyers in a politically charged case",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's unprecedented bid to reshape the Federal Reserve board is putting the Supreme Court in a familiar position, weighing an emergency appeal from the president\u2019s lawyers in a politically charged case.",
      "The court is hearing arguments Wednesday over Trump's effort to oust Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook based on allegations she committed mortgage fraud, which she denies.",
      "No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency\u2019s 112-year history.",
      "The true motivation, Trump's critics say, is the Republican president's desire to wrest control of U.S. interest rate policy. Trump wants interest rates to fall sharply so the government can borrow more cheaply and Americans can pay lower borrowing costs for new homes, cars or other large purchases, as worries about high costs have soured some voters on his economic management.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the board cut a key interest rate three times in a row in the last four months of 2025, but that's more slowly than Trump wants. The Fed also suggested it may leave rates unchanged in coming months, concerned about triggering higher inflation.",
      "Powell is expected to be in attendance when the justices take up an emergency plea from the Trump administration to be allowed to remove Cook from her job while her challenge to the firing plays out in court. Judges on lower courts have allowed her to remain in her post as one of seven central bank governors.",
      "If Trump could name someone to take Cook's place, he would have four of his appointees on the seven-member board. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed\u2019s governing board, was appointed in 2022 by President Joe Biden, a Democrat.",
      "The justices are being asked to effectively bless Trump's effort to undermine the Fed's independence, said Columbia University law professor Lev Menand, who has joined a brief in support of Cook.",
      "\u201cThis case is about much more than Cook,\u201d Menand said. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether President Trump will be able to take over the Federal Reserve board in the coming months.\u201d",
      "The threat to the Fed's independence spurred Powell\u2019s three living predecessors, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, to weigh in on Cook\u2019s behalf. They were joined by five former Treasury secretaries appointed by presidents of both political parties and other former high-ranking economic officials.",
      "In their filing, lawyers for the former officials wrote that immediately ousting Cook \u201cwould expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed\u2019s independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.\u201d",
      "Economists warn that a politicized Fed that caves in to the president\u2019s demands will damage its credibility as an inflation fighter and likely lead investors to demand higher rates before investing in U.S. treasuries.",
      "With Cook's case under review at the high court, Trump dramatically escalated his confrontation with the Fed. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of Powell and has served the central bank with subpoenas.",
      "Powell himself took the rare step of responding to Trump, calling the threat of criminal charges \u201cpretexts\u201d that mask the real reason, Trump's frustration over interest rates. The Justice Department has said the dispute is ostensibly about Powell\u2019s testimony to Congress in June over the cost of a massive renovation of Fed buildings.",
      "In Trump's first year in office, the justices generally, but not always, went along with Trump's pleas for emergency action to counteract lower-court rulings against him, including allowing the firings of the heads of other governmental agencies at the president's discretion, with no claim that they did anything wrong.",
      "But the court has sent signals that it is approaching the independence of the nation's central bank more cautiously, calling the Fed \u201ca uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\u201d",

      "The case against Cook stems from allegations she claimed two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as \u201cprimary residences\u201d in June and July 2021, before she joined the Fed board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. \u201cThere is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,\u201d a Cook lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi in November.",
      "Cook specified that her Atlanta condo would be a \u201cvacation home,\u201d according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. In a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a \u201c2nd home.\u201d Lowell wrote that the case against her largely rests on \u201cone stray reference\u201d in a 2021 mortgage document that was \u201cplainly innocuous in light of the several other truthful and more specific disclosures\u201d about the homes she has purchased.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the Trump administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which she said was limited to misconduct while in office.",
      "Cobb also held that Trump\u2019s firing would have deprived Cook of her due process, or legal right, to contest the firing.",
      "By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to let Cook\u2019s firing proceed.",
      "At the Supreme Court, the administration argues Cook has no right to a hearing and courts have no role to play in reviewing Trump's actions.",
      "Trump lawfully fired Cook, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote, \u201cafter concluding that the American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who made misrepresentations material to her mortgage rates that appear to have been grossly negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.\u201d",
      "Sauer will face off against Paul Clement, a conservative lawyer who served in Sauer's role under President George W. Bush and has argued for expanding gun rights, against same-sex marriage and for striking down the Affordable Care Act. Both men once worked as law clerks for Justice Antonin Scalia.",
      "Cook's fate should not be determined by \u201cuntested allegations\u201d or \u201cbefore any facts are found,\u201d her lawyers told the court. She should be able to remain in her job at least while her case proceeds, they wrote.",

      "A privately funded initiative called \u201cBe The People\u201d will try to connect hundreds of millions of Americans with efforts to solve local problems as part of a vision for the next 250 years of the United States",
      "As the official celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence culminate on July 4, a well-financed, privately funded initiative will kick off to try to connect hundreds of millions of Americans with efforts to solve local problems.",
      "The \"Be The People\" campaign aspires to change the perception that the U.S. is hopelessly divided and that individuals have little power to overcome problems like poverty, addiction, violence and stalled economic mobility. It also wants to move people take action to solve those problems.",
      "Brian Hooks, chairman and CEO of the nonprofit network Stand Together, said the 250th anniversary is a unique moment \u201cto show people that they matter, that they have a part to play, and that the future is unwritten, but it depends on each one of us stepping up to play our part.\u201d",
      "Funded by a mix of 50 philanthropic foundations and individual donors, Be The People builds on research that indicates many people want to contribute to their communities but don't know how. The initiative has raised more than $200 million for its first year's budget.",
      "Founding members range from nonprofits \u2014 including GivingTuesday, Goodwill Industries and Habitat for Humanity, businesses like Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment and the National Basketball Association, to funders like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.",
      "Hooks said this is a 10-year commitment toward trying to achieve what would be a profound shift in behavior and culture. He referenced a 2024 Pew Research Center survey that found most Americans in 2023 and 2024 did not believe that the U.S. could solve its most important problems, saying it was a \u201cred alert\u201d for the country.",
      "Hooks said the initiative envisions actions far beyond volunteering or service that people could do in their free time. He pointed to a role for businesses and schools and said the initiative would launch a major data collection effort to track whether people are actually more engaged and whether problems are actually getting solved.",
      "Stand Together, which was founded by the billionaire Charles Koch, works across a broad range of issues and communities in the U.S. and has carved out a role for itself as a convener that can bring coalitions together across ideological lines.",
      "\u201cBe The People,\u201d will not incorporate as a new nonprofit, but act more like a banner for groups to organize under and use to connect to resources. As an example, at the Atlanta Hawks game on Monday, Martin Luther King III and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, linked a program they launched last year, Realize the Dream, which aims to increase acts of service, to the new campaign.",
      "\u201cOur vision is that \u2018Be The People\u2019 helps lift up what is already happening in communities across the country and reminds people that service and shared responsibility are defining parts of the American story,\u201d the Kings said in a written statement.",
      "\u201cBe The People,\u201d will operate similarly to the nonprofit GivingTuesday. While it started as a hashtag to encourage people to donate to nonprofits on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, GivingTuesday has grown into a platform that provides nonprofits with tools, like fundraising kits and advice on how to reach and mobilize their supporters. Nonprofits can participate however they like but gain some momentum by acting alongside many other groups.",

      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- The search for dozens of people reported missing after a massive fire at a shopping plaza in Pakistan\u2019s largest city entered a fourth day Tuesday as hopes of finding survivors faded, officials said.",
      "Rescuers reached some of the most badly damaged sections in the multistory Gul Plaza in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province, but those areas either have collapsed or been severely weakened since the blaze Saturday. The reasons remain unclear, officials said.",
      "Police and hospital officials said rescuers have so far recovered the remains of at least 23 people, many burned beyond recognition. In several cases, only body parts were found and DNA testing is underway to identify the victims, according to police surgeon Dr. Summaiya Syed.",
      "The sprawling shopping plaza houses about 1,200 shops, most selling imported clothing, cosmetics and plastic household goods. Dozens of the missing were shop owners and customers.",
      "More than 65 people were reported missing and mobile phone data showed at least 31 were inside the plaza on the night of the fire, senior police official Asad Raza said. Authorities believe others reported missing may not have been carrying cellphones, Raza said.",
      "Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that some sections of the building had already been searched and heavy machinery was being used to clear rubble from a portion that collapsed Sunday.",
      "Wahab met with families of the missing, many visibly shaken, and assured them that authorities were making every effort to locate those still unaccounted for.",

      "China's one-child policy led to harsh measures like forced abortions and sterilizations",
      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",
      "China's leaders saw unbridled population growth as a potential threat in 1980 \u2014 to both economic development and its ability to feed what had grown into a nation of 1 billion people.",
      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",
      "But the leadership at the time decided to curb population growth more directly, launching the one-child policy and enforcing it with stiff financial penalties for parents who had more than one child, as well as abortions and sterilization campaigns. It lasted for 35 years.",
      "Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes that the number of people getting sterilized plunged from 1.4 million women and 180,000 men in 2014, two years before the policy was eased, to 190,000 women and 2,600 men in 2020.",
      "In 2016, the government began allowing two children per couple and raised the limit to three children in 2021. But it has proven more difficult to reverse the mentality of people than the policy.",

      "Now, some from that generation, once dubbed \u201clittle emperors\u201d because they were so fussed over, face the pressure of meeting the expectations, including financial, of being the only child.",
      "As they reach their 30s and 40s, there is only one child to support two parents, and in some cases, up to four grandparents. For some, this can lead to anxiety and depression, Fong said.",
      "\u201cThe little emperor at some point becomes the slave,\u201d she said.",
      "China is an aging society that will likely face a major shortfall in the coming decades: not enough people of working age to support a growing population of retirees. That could burden government finances and pension systems.",
      "The government has launched a slew of polices to try to boost the birth rate, from eliminating a tax exemption for condoms to giving cash subsidies to couples who have children. But the experience of other countries shows that it's difficult to turn around a declining birth rate.",

      "A judge has granted Duke's request for a temporary restraining order blocking quarterback Darian Mensah from enrolling to play football at another school until a court hearing set for early February.",
      "The school filed a lawsuit Monday in Durham County Superior Court against Mensah seeking to block his efforts to transfer and reach a contract with another school to play elsewhere next season. The complaint came three days after Mensah reversed his previously announced plan to return to the Blue Devils after leading them to the Atlantic Coast Conference title.",
      "Judge Michael O'Foghludha signed an order Wednesday that prevents Mensah from enrolling elsewhere, signing a licensing deal with another school or taking any other action breaching the two-season contract Mensah signed with Duke running through 2026.",
      "The order, formalizing a verbal ruling from Tuesday's hearing, didn't grant Duke's additional request seeking to block Mensah from entering his name into the transfer portal entirely. But he otherwise can't take additional steps in the process of reaching a deal to play at a new school, with the order designed to \u201cpreserve the status quo\u201d until a Feb. 2 hearing.",
      "\u201cMr. Mensah has an existing contract with Duke which the university intends to honor, and we expect he will do the same,\" Duke said in a statement Wednesday. \"The court-ordered temporary restraining order issued (Tuesday) ensures he does not violate his contract. The university is committed to supporting all our student-athletes, while expecting each of them to abide by their contractual obligations.\u201d",
      "The school argued its contract with Mensah \u2014 signed in July 2025 \u2014 paid him for exclusive rights to market Mensah\u2019s name, image and likeness (NIL) tied to playing college football. Duke's lawsuit argued that the contract requires parties to go through arbitration before any dispute can be resolved.",
      "\u201cThis case arises out of the decision of a star quarterback in the increasingly complex world of college athletics,\u201d the complaint states in its opening. \u201cBut at its core, this is a simple case that involves the integrity of contracts.\u201d",
      "In an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday, sports-law attorney Darren Heitner, who has worked with Mensah, noted Duke\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order preventing Mensah from entering the transfer portal had been denied. Later in the day, however, Heitner said on social media that Mensah \u201cis not, for the time being\u201d allowed to enroll or play football elsewhere before a decision by a different judge set to preside over the next hearing.",

      "James H. Roberts Jr. of the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court granted Bediako a temporary restraining order and said he is \u201cimmediately eligible\u201d to participate in all team activities.

      "The coaching search process has already begun, with the Bills already set to interview several candidates including former Giants coach and Buffalo\u2019s offensive coordinator Brian Daboll; Commanders running backs coach Anthony Lynn, who finished the 2016 season as Buffalo\u2019s interim coach; and Bills current offensive coordinator Joe Brady.",

      "The video also takes shots at Democratic Gov. Tim Walz for the fraud cases that have dogged his administration and includes clips of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a frequent target of the ire of President Donald Trump.",
      "Tafoya, who's long been active in Minnesota Republican politics, is best known for her work from 2011-2022 as a sideline reporter for NBC's Sunday Night Football. She currently hosts a frequently political podcast. Other Republicans in the race include former NBA player Royce White, who lost to U.S. Sen.

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Carlos Alcaraz says he got together with Roger Federer for a round of golf before the Australian Open, and it went just as the 22-year-old Spaniard expected.",
      "Federer's swing, he said, is \u201cas beautiful as the tennis.\u201d",

      "It was another step closer to his quest to be the youngest player to complete a career Grand Slam in men's singles \u2014 that's a full collection of the four major tennis trophies.",
      "That's something Federer, who was back at the Australian Open with his family on a very-much belated farewell tour, had to wait seven years to achieve after winning the first of his 20 major titles.",
      "Alcaraz already has six \u2014 two each at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open \u2014 and needs the Australian title for the personal Slam. He's never gone past the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.",
      "His main rival, Jannik Sinner, has won the last two Australian titles. The pair have split the last eight majors evenly between them in a rivalry now known as Sincaraz.",
      "So it's little surprise Alcaraz is looking to some of the greats of tennis, like Federer and others, to figure out ways to get ahead.",
      "He has been improving areas of his game, particularly the serve \u2014 which now looks very similar to Novak Djokovic's. So much so that Djokovic, who has won 10 of his 24 majors at Melbourne Park, has noticed.",
      "With Djokovic and No. 2-ranked Sinner on the opposite side of the draw, Alcaraz gets to observe them on his off days at Melbourne Park. And those, for now, don't involve other sporting distractions.",

      "NEW YORK -- Handprints on cave walls in a largely unexplored area of Indonesia may be the oldest rock art studied so far, dating back to at least 67,800 years ago.",
      "The tan-colored prints analyzed by Indonesian and Australian researchers on the island of Sulawesi were made by blowing pigment over hands placed against the cave walls, leaving an outline. Some of the fingertips were also tweaked to look more pointed.",
      "This prehistoric art form suggests the Indonesian island was home to a flourishing artistic culture. To figure out how old the paintings were, researchers dated mineral crusts that had formed on top of the art.",
      "Upon seeing the new study, independent paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger said she \u201clet out a little squeal of joy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt fits everything I'd been thinking,\u201d she said.",
      "Indonesia is known to host some of the world\u2019s earliest cave drawings, and scientists have analyzed countless examples of ancient art across the globe \u2014 including simple marks on bones and stones that go back hundreds of thousands of years. Cross-hatched markings on a piece of rock in South Africa have been dated to about 73,000 years ago.",
      "The new art from southeastern Sulawesi is the oldest to be found on cave walls. The stencils also represent a more complex tradition of rock art that could have been a shared cultural practice, said study author Maxime Aubert with Griffith University, who published the study Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Scientists are eager to understand when early humans learned to make art, moving from dots and lines to more meaningful representations of themselves and the world around them. These cave drawings help firm up a timeline for the dawn of human creativity.",

Or they may belong to modern humans venturing away from Africa, who could have wandered through the Middle East and Australia around this time. Fine details on the cave art, including the intentionally modified fingertips, point to a human hand.",
      "Other drawings discovered in the same area of the island, including a human figure, a bird and horse-like animals were found to be created much more recently, some of them about 4,000 years ago.",
      "There's likely more art to be found on nearby islands that could be even older than the handprints. Future studies may help scientists understand how these artistic traditions spread across the globe and how they're woven into the fabric of humanity's early days.",

      "Meteorologists warn that a stretched polar vortex could bring severe winter weather to much of the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Warm Arctic waters and cold continental land are combining to stretch the dreaded polar vortex in a way that will send much of the United States a devastating dose of winter later this week with swaths of painful subzero temperatures, heavy snow and powerline-toppling ice.",
      "Meteorologists said the eastern two-thirds of the nation is threatened with a winter storm that could rival the damage of a major hurricane and has some origins in an Arctic that is warming from climate change. They warn that the frigid weather is likely to stick around through the rest of January and into early February, meaning the snow and ice that accumulates will take a long time to melt.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s forecast has the storm stretching from New Mexico to New England, threatening at least 250 million people.",
      "\u201cI think people are underestimating just how bad it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Ryan Maue, now a private meteorologist.",
      "The polar vortex, a patch of bitter cold air that often stays penned up in northern Canada and Alaska, is being elongated by a wave in the upper atmosphere that goes back to a relatively ice-free part of the Arctic and snow-buried Siberia. As the bone-chilling temperatures sweep through the U.S., they'll meet with moisture from off California and the Gulf of Mexico to set up crippling ice and snow in many areas.",
      "The origins of the system begin in the Arctic, where relatively warmer temperatures add energy to the polar vortex and help push its cold air south.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is aligned perfectly that the pattern is locked into this warm Arctic, cold continent,\" Maue said. \"And it\u2019s not just here for us in North America, but the landmass of Eastern Europe to Siberia is also exceptionally cold. The whole hemisphere has gone into the deep freeze.\u201d",
      "As far back as October 2025, changes in the Arctic and low sea ice were setting up conditions for the kind of stretched polar vortex that brings severe winter weather to the U.S., said winter weather expert Judah Cohen, an MIT research scientist. Heavy Siberian snowfall added to the push-and-pull of weather that warps the shape of the normally mostly circular air pattern. Those conditions \u201ckind of loaded the dice a bit'' for a stretching of the polar vortex, he said.",
      "Cohen co-authored a July 2025 study that found more stretched polar vortex events linked to severe winter weather bursts in the central and eastern U.S. over the past decade. Cohen said part of the reason is that dramatically low sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas in the Arctic helps set up a pattern of waves that end up causing U.S. cold bursts. A warmer Arctic is causing sea ice in that region to shrink faster than other places, studies have found.",
      "Arctic sea ice is at a record low extent for this time of year, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",
      "The center of the stretched polar vortex will be somewhere above Duluth, Minnesota, by Friday morning, ushering in \u201clong-lasting brutal cold,\u201d Maue said. Temperatures in the North and Midwest will get about as cold as possible, even down to minus 25 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 32 to minus 34 degrees Celsius), Maue said. The average low temperature for the Lower 48 states will dance around 11 or 12 degrees (minus 12 to minus 11 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Maue said.",

Treacherous freezing rain could stretch from the southern plains through the mid-South and into the Carolinas, he said.",

      "For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. They say it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. The three species are all brush-tailed, so named because their tails drag on the ice: the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo.",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species and it happens at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical in survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. They used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps and no competition. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species and now there's overlap. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up the changes her eyes saw, she said.",
      "\u201cChinstraps are declining globally,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cModels show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it\u2019s very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\u201d",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \u201cyou have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\u201d which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",

      "A woman in Canada has become a global symbol of defiance against Iran's regime",
      "LONDON -- With one puff of a cigarette, a woman in Canada became a global symbol of defiance against Iran's bloody crackdown on dissent \u2014 and the world saw the flame.",
      "A video that has gone viral in recent days shows the woman \u2014 who described herself as an Iranian refugee \u2014 snapping open a lighter and setting the flame to a photo she holds. It ignites, illuminating the visage of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest cleric. Then the woman dips a cigarette into the glow, takes a quick drag \u2014 and lets what remains of the image fall to the pavement.",
      "Whether staged or a spontaneous act of defiance \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of debate \u2014 the video has become one of the defining images of the protests in Iran against the Islamic Republic\u2019s ailing economy, as U.S. President Donald Trump considers military action in the country again.",
      "The gesture has jumped from the virtual world to the real one, with opponents of the regime lighting cigarettes on photos of the ayatollah from Israel to Germany and Switzerland to the United States.",
      "In the 34 seconds of footage, many across platforms like X, Instagram and Reddit saw one person defy a series of the theocracy\u2019s laws and norms in a riveting act of autonomy. She wears no hijab, three years after the \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d protests against the regime\u2019s required headscarves.",
      "She burns an image of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, a crime in the Islamic republic punishable by death. Her curly hair cascades \u2014 yet another transgression in the Iranian government\u2019s eyes. She lights a cigarette from the flame \u2014 a gesture considered immodest in Iran.",
      "And in those few seconds, circulated and amplified a million times over, she steps into history.",
      "In 2026, social media is a central battleground for narrative control over conflicts. Protesters in Iran say the unrest is a demonstration against the regime\u2019s strictures and competence. Iran has long cast it as a plot by outsiders like United States and Israel to destabilize the Islamic Republic.",
      "And both sides are racing to tell the story of it that will endure.",
      "Iranian state media announces wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls \u201cterrorists\u201d and also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, the only way to get videos and images out to the internet. There was evidence on Thursday that the regime\u2019s bloody crackdown had somewhat smothered the dissent after activists said it had killed at least 2,615 people. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the mayhem of the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Social media has bloomed with photos of people lighting cigarettes from photos of Iran\u2019s leader. \u201cSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em. #Iran,\u201d posted Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana.",
      "In the age of AI, misinformation and disinformation, there\u2019s abundant reason to question emotionally and politically charged images. So when \u201cthe cigarette girl\u201d appeared online this month, plenty of users did just that.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear, for example, whether she was lighting up inside Iran or somewhere with free-speech protections as a sign of solidarity. Some spotted a background that seemed to be in Canada. She confirmed that in interviews. But did her collar line up correctly? Was the flame realistic? Would a real woman let her hair get so close to the fire?",
      "Many wondered: Is the \u201ccigarette girl\u201d an example of \u201cpsyops?\u201d That, too, is unclear. That\u2019s a feature of warfare and statecraft as old as human conflict, in which an image or sound is deliberately disseminated by someone with a stake in the outcome. From the allies\u2019 fake radio broadcasts during World War II to the Cold War\u2019s nuclear missile parades, history is rich with examples.",

      "Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stared down everybody who said it couldn\u2019t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\u201d communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \u201cNow Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\u201d",
      "The figures, reported to Australia\u2019s government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.",
      "To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.",
      "About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \u201cdeactivated or restricted\u201d was encouraging.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.",
      "Australian officials didn\u2019t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.",
      "In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms \u2014 a concern that led to the ban's enactment.",
      "The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia\u2019s sprawling rural areas.",

      "Judge Jeffrey Pearlman, a Supreme Court justice in New York County, wrote in a ruling Wednesday on a lawsuit brought by voters, who were represented by the liberal-leaning Elias Law Group, that the 11th in New York's current map violates the state's constitution because it dilutes the votes of Black and Latino voters.",
      "\"Based on the facts presented by the expert witness reports and on the record, it is clear to the Court that the current district lines of CD-11 are a contributing factor in the lack of representation for minority voters,\" Pearlman wrote.",
      "Pearlman said that the state's redistricting commission should redraw the 11th District's lines by Feb. 6, based on the request of the New York State Board of Elections that any new map should be finished by then to allow the state to prepare for elections. New York's state primaries are in June.",

      "A medical examiner has determined that an Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died as a result of homicide",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.",
      "Geraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.",
      "But a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.",
      "His death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.",
      "The autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.",
      "The report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos \u201cbecome unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.\u201d It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages \u2014 tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury \u2014 in the eyelids and skin of the neck.",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.",
      "He said the contusions on Lunas Campos\u2019 body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.",
      "The autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.",
      "ICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.",
      "\u201cWhile in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,\u201d the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. \u201cMedical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.\u201d",
      "Lunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.",
      "Last Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.",
      "\u201cCampos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.\u201d",
      "After the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was \u201ca criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.\u201d",
      "New York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state\u2019s sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.",

The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility and has subcontracted with other companies to help operate the camp.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.",
      "A final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials\u2019 legal jurisdiction to investigate.",
      "Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.",
      "ICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.",
      "In addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.",

      "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press reveals that the agency allows immigration officers to forcibly enter homes to make arrests without a judicial warrant",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal immigration officers are asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people\u2019s homes without a judge\u2019s warrant, according to an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press, marking a sharp reversal of longstanding guidance meant to respect constitutional limits on government searches.",
      "The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.",
      "The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.",
      "For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president\u2019s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo\u2019s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.",
      "It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.",
      "The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.",
      "The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.",
      "The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: \u201cAlthough the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.\"",
      "The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.",
      "When asked about the memo, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had \u201cfull due process and a final order of removal.\u201d",
      "She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person\u2019s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have \u201crecognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,\u201d without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person\u2019s home since the memo was issued relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.",
      "Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials \u201cdisclosing a secretive - and seemingly unconstitutional - policy directive.\u201d",
      "A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has shined a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers\u2019 use of proper warrants.",
      "Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.",
      "All law enforcement operations \u2014 including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection \u2014 are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.",

      "\u201cShould the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien\u2019s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent\u2019s authority and intent to enter,\u201d the memo reads.",
      "The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to \u201cselect DHS officials\u201d who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.",
      "One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.",

      "But according to the whistleblowers\u2019 account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.",

      "Whistleblower Aid called the new policy a \u201ccomplete break from the law\u201d and said it undercuts the \u201cFourth Amendment and the rights it protects.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in \u201csuper handy\u201d during the medical crisis.",
      "During their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.",
      "NASA\u2019s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, \u201cso when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.\u201d",
      "It was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. \u201cIt really helped,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cOf course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"",
      "The space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA \u201cmade all the right decisions\u201d in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.",
      "Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.",

      "Businesses across large swaths of Minneapolis have taken a hit as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration carries out a massive immigration sweep that has spurred protests. As staff and customers stay home and protesters target businesses they see as aiding federal immigration enforcement, countless stores have temporarily closed, canceled events or reduced hours. Some hotels that housed federal immigration officers and saw protests have stopped accepting reservations altogether, while Minneapolis-based Target Corp. also has seen protests.",
      "The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities cited devastating economic impacts in a lawsuit filed this month imploring a federal judge to halt the immigration operations. The lawsuit asserted that some businesses have reported sales drops up to 80%.",
      "An October report from the Minneapolis Federal Reserve noted sluggish economic indicators even before over 2,000 federal immigration officers began arriving in Minneapolis and St. Paul. But a January report emphasized that some Minnesota businesses experienced dampened sales and slower foot traffic out of \u201cfear of immigration enforcement.\u201d Nearly 20% of all businesses surveyed reported lower employment head counts citing similar concerns.",

      "On Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.",
      "\u201cI knew never what was on the other side of that door \u2014 that fear is what I feel today,\u201d Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. \u201cI've always been innocent. I loved that job.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including pocketing $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.",
      "The judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.",
      "Bongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building, crawling under billowing smoke to evacuate residents. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose. Before going on duty, he would call his mother to say he loved her.",
      "\u201cThere are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,\u201d Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.",
      "A jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, as well as counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.",
      "Prosecutors said Bongiovanni's \u201clittle dark secret\u201d caused immeasurable damage over a period of 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.",
      "Bongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community in North Buffalo where he grew up.",
      "He was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.",

      "It also involved the Pharoah\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club\u2019s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.",
      "The prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA, which has seen a string of corruption scandals and at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.",

      "CHICAGO -- Snapchat messages a Chicago man accused of soliciting the murder of a top Border Patrol commander unknowingly sent to a government informant took center stage Wednesday at the opening day of the man\u2019s federal trial.",
      "Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, faces one count of murder-for-hire in the first criminal trial stemming from the immigration crackdown that began last year in and around the nation\u2019s third-largest city. It's the latest test of credibility for the Trump administration's narratives about the Chicago operation.",
      "Federal prosecutors have alleged Espinoza Martinez was a gang member who put a $10,000 bounty on the life of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive and controversial campaigns nationwide, most recently in Minnesota.",
      "But defense attorneys said Espinoza Martinez, a carpenter with roughly $20 in his bank account, sent messages amounting to \u201cneighborhood gossip\u201d to his brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant.",
      "The Snapchats came in October as the Chicago area was seeing a surge of federal immigration officers. Arrests, protests and standoffs with agents were common throughout the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs, particularly in the city\u2019s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about someone being on trial for expressing strong, even angry views about immigration enforcement policy,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin told jurors during opening statements. \u201cMake no mistake, the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, was not just him mouthing off, was not him blowing off steam behind a keyboard.\u201d",
      "Defense attorneys said the messages were merely recirculating details already on Facebook.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not guilty because repeating neighborhood gossip is not a crime,\u201d defense attorney Jonathan Bedi told jurors. \u201cRepeating neighborhood gossip is not intending to go commit a murder.\u201d",
      "Federal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a \u201cranking member\u201d of the Latin Kings, but prosecutors' lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.",
      "One recipient of the Snapchats was Adrian Jimenez, a 44-year-old man owns a construction company and had been in touch with Espinoza Martinez over Snapchat about work in the last year. The government's first witness, Jimenez had previously been identified in the criminal complaint as an anonymous \u201csource of information.\u201d",
      "Pictures of the Snapchats were shown on screens in court. One read \u201c10k if u take him down,\u201d along with a picture of Bovino. Some messages were sent in Spanish but translated into English for court.",

Each had been previously mentioned by him or his administration in recent weeks, part of a broader push to address affordability generally, a hot-button issue with voters heading into the midterms.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. The combination of higher mortgage rates, years of skyrocketing home prices and a chronic shortage of homes nationally following more than a decade of below-average home construction have left many aspiring homeowners priced out of the market. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes remained stuck last year at 30-year lows.",
      "In his remarks, Trump stressed the need to lower interest rates on home loans and credit cards in order to give aspiring homebuyers more financial flexibility to save up for a down payment on a home and more purchasing power when it comes time to buy.",
      "\u201cWe can drop interest rates to a level, and that\u2019s one thing we do want to do,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s natural. That\u2019s good for everybody. You know, the dropping of the interest rate, we should be paying a much lower interest than we are.\u201d",
      "Trump noted that he has directed the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates. Trump said earlier this month that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have $200 billion in cash that would be used to buy mortgage bonds. However, some economists have said such a move would likely have only a minimal impact on mortgage rates.",
      "Trump, who spent much of last year demanding that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates, also reiterated that he will be announcing a new Fed chair soon to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as chair is due to end in May.",
      "\"I think they\u2019ll do a very good job,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Fed rate cuts don\u2019t always translate into lower mortgage rates. That\u2019s what happened in the fall of 2024 after the central bank cut its main rate for the first time in more than four years. Instead of falling, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually cresting above 7% in January this year. At that time, the 10-year Treasury yield was climbing toward 5%.",
      "More recently, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was at 6.06% last week, its lowest level in more than three years, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",

The average rate on credit cards is around 21%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Mexico sent 37 cartel members to United States at the request of the Justice Department",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Mexico sent 37 cartel members to United States at the request of the Justice Department, but insisted it was a \u201csovereign decision\u201d by Mexico.",
      "Sheinbaum responded to claims by analysts and opponents who said the transfers carried out the previous day were the result of mounting pressure from Washington as President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action on cartels.",
      "Speaking at her regular morning news briefing, Sheinbaum said that although the transfers were made at the request of the U.S. government, the decision was taken by the National Security Council after analyzing what was \u201cconvenient for Mexico\u201d and in terms of its \u201cnational security.\u201d",
      "\u201cMexico is put first above all else, even if they ask for whatever they have to ask for. It is a sovereign decision,\u201d she added.",
      "Sheinbaum, who has been praised for her level-headed management of relations with Trump, has been forced to walk a fine line between making concessions to the U.S. government and projecting strength both domestically and internationally.",
      "Observers say the Mexican government has used the transfers as a sort of pressure valve to offset demands by Trump and show authorities are cracking down on criminal groups. Tension has only mounted since the U.S. carried out a military operation in Venezuela and deposed of then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an extraordinary use of force that set leaders across Latin America on edge.",

      "In August, Mexico's security minister acknowledged that some of the cartel leaders sent to the United States at that time were continuing criminal operations from prison and that their transfer was agreed upon because there was a risk they could be released due to judicial rulings.",

      "A judge overseeing Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s criminal case says two members of Congress lack the legal right to intervene and press their demand for a court-appointed observer to ensure the government complies with a new law ordering release of its files on ...",
      "NEW YORK -- A judge overseeing Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal case said Wednesday that two members of Congress lacked the legal right to intervene and press their demand for a court-appointed observer to ensure the government complies with a new law ordering release of its files on Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "But the lawmakers are free to bring a civil lawsuit or work through the tools they have in Congress to improve oversight, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled.",
      "U.S. Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had co-sponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in November. It required the public disclosure of files related to the sex trafficking investigations into Epstein, the late financier, and Maxwell, his longtime confidant.",
      "Engelmayer largely agreed with the Justice Department\u2019s insistence that he had no authority to grant the congressmen's request to speed the release of that material. They had urged Engelmayer to name an independent monitor to ensure that the government immediately released the more than 2 million documents it has identified as investigative materials. Khanna and Massie said the slow disclosure of the documents violated the law and had caused \u201cserious trauma to survivors.\u201d",
      "A month after the deadline had passed for the materials to be made public, only about 12,000 documents have been made public. The department has said the release of the files was delayed by redactions required to protect the identities of those who were abused.",
      "Engelmayer said the questions raised by Khanna and Massie raised about whether the department was complying with the law were \u201cundeniably important and timely.\u201d But, he said, the way in which the members of Congress were trying to intervene was not permitted.",
      "The judge, who inherited Maxwell\u2019s case after the trial judge was appointed to an appeals court, ruled that has no authority to supervise the department\u2019s compliance with the new law, and that Massie and Khanna have no standing, or legal right, to insinuate themselves into Maxwell\u2019s case.",

      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her December 2021 sex trafficking conviction.

A jury found that she had helped to recruit girls for Epstein to abuse over the past quarter-century and had also participated in some of the abuse.",

      "Those are among the key findings in a report released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center based on surveys conducted in early 2024 of adults in six of the region's most populous countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.",
      "\u201cOur analysis found that the Catholic share of the population in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru \u2014 which collectively make up about 75% of Latin America\u2019s population \u2014 has significantly declined since 2013-14, while a growing share of adults in the region are religiously unaffiliated,\u201d said Kirsten Lesage, a Pew research associate and the lead author of the report.",
      "Most Latin Americans are Christian, and Catholicism remains the dominant religion. But the exodus from the church continues in a region that was once a stronghold for the Catholic faith and has close ties to Pope Leo XIV, who served for decades in Peru before being elected in 2025, and his Argentina-born predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "The survey found that Catholics make up 46% to 67% of the adult population in these six countries, and the percent who are religiously unaffiliated ranges from 12% to 33%.",
      "But the share of Catholics has declined in each country over the past decade by at least 9 percentage points. Meanwhile the percent of adults who are unaffiliated rose by 7 percentage points or more, the survey found.",
      "\u201cIn fact, there are now more religiously unaffiliated adults than Protestants in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico,\u201d Lesage said.",
      "A decade ago, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru all had Catholic majorities: about 6 in 10 or more adults in each country identified as Catholic, the report says.",
      "Today, about half of Brazilians and Chileans identify as Catholic. About two-thirds of Mexicans and Peruvians are Catholic, as are about 6 in 10 adults in Argentina and Colombia, but all of those majorities are smaller than 10 years ago.",
      "The Catholic church\u2019s strong influence has eroded in Latin America following clergy sex abuse scandals and opposition to the church\u2019s stances against abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",

      "A decade ago, the Pew survey focused on how Latin Americans born into Catholic families had increasingly left the faith for Protestant churches, while many others had dropped organized religion altogether in a major shift in the region\u2019s religious identity.",

      "Dallas Pokornik, 33, of Toronto, was arrested in Panama after being indicted on wire fraud charges in federal court in Hawaii last October. He pleaded not guilty Tuesday following his extradition.",
      "According to court documents, Pokornik was a flight attendant for a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019, then used fake employee identification from that carrier to obtain tickets reserved for pilots and flight attendants on three other airlines.",
      "U.S. prosecutors said Tuesday that Pokornik even requested to sit in an extra seat in the cockpit \u2014 the \u201cjump seat\u201d \u2014 typically reserved for off-duty pilots. It was not clear from court documents whether he ever actually rode in a plane\u2019s cockpit, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to say.",
      "The indictment did not identify the airlines except to say they are based in Honolulu, Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas. Representatives for Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines \u2014 which are respectively based in those cities \u2014 didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Air Canada, which is based in Toronto, also did not respond to an email seeking comment.",

    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:20:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified in his lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "\"No, I didn't like [Simmons] at all. There's days he annoys me now,\" joked Stanley in a 2014 interview with CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason.",
      "But the two Jewish New Yorkers bonded over their backgrounds and shared work ethic. With Stanley, Simmons said, \"One and one is three.\"",
      "Next is Christopher \"Tricky Stewart,\" who co-wrote and co-produced Beyonc\u00e9's blockbuster hit \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" Raised in a musical family in Markham, Illinois, Stewart was writing songs by age 12.",
      "His big break came in 2007, with what he calls the \"single most important song\" he's ever written: Rihanna's \"Umbrella.\" He once told MTV about the song's success, \"When she recorded the 'ellas,' you knew your life was about to change if you had anything to do with that record.\"",
      "You oughta know the next artist on the list: Alanis Morissette.",
      "Morissette's breakup anthem, \"You Oughta Know,\" was written from what she described as fractured devastation. With her blistering lyrics, the Canadian singer set off a cultural earthquake. Her 1995 album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" sold 33 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"When I write songs, everything that jumps to the fore \u2013 lyrically and musically \u2013 is that which I have sublimated or repressed. So, it's all my unconscious writing,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" featured host Vladimir Duthiers in November.",
      "Other Hall of Famers, Terry Britten and Graham Lyle helped lift Tina Turner from soul singer to superstar, writing many of Turner's greatest hits, including \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" and \"We Don't Need Another Hero.\"",
      "Britten also wrote many hits for Cliff Richard, like \"Devil Woman.\" Meanwhile, Lyle \u2013 and his bandmate Benny Gallagher \u2013 wrote \"A Heart in New York,\" famously performed at Simon & Garfunkel's 1981 concert in Central Park.",

      "\"There's just a part of my brain that's kind of scoring everything,\" Loggins said in a 2022 PBS interview.",
      "Then there's Walter Afanasieff, who co-wrote and co-produced Mariah Carey's No. 1 smash, \"Hero.\" And then again, for the holiday classic, \"All I Want For Christmas is You.\"",
      "\"We'd play musical ping pong,\" he's said of his more than 11-year collaboration with Carey.",

      "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail as he awaits trial on child sex abuse charges.",
      "The order Tuesday, by state district court Judge David Murphy during a detention hearing, is linked to accusations that Busfield inappropriately touched a minor while working as a director on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "The judge ordered that the defendant be released on his own recognizance, pending trial. Busfield will be supervised upon release by a pretrial service in Albuquerque, and can leave the state to live at home, the judge said. Under the conditions of his release, Busfield cannot be in possession of firearms or drugs and can't have contact with the alleged victims.",
      "Busfield, an Emmy Award-winning actor who is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" was ordered held without bond last week at his first court appearance. Busfield called the allegations lies in a video shared before he turned himself in.",
      "At the hearing Tuesday, Busfield was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail uniform in a New Mexico state district court, while wife and actor Melissa Gilbert watched from the court gallery.",
      "Gilbert was tearful while exiting the courtroom after the judge ordered Busfield's release.",
      "Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to '80s TV series \"Little House on the Prairie,\" is on the list of potential witnesses submitted ahead of the hearing.",
      "Albuquerque police issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest earlier this month on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported Busfield touched him on private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "On Monday, Busfield's attorneys submitted two brief audio recordings of initial police interviews in which the children say Busfield did not touch them in private areas. The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",
      "Legal experts say New Mexico is among a few states that allow polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but a judge has final say over whether one can be used. There are strict requirements for admission.",

      "Roughly an hour before the interview, Brown's assistant informed \"CBS Mornings\" that the cast member wouldn't be joining the on-set interview due to mental health concerns and, in part, because he was worried about being bullied.",

I'd be lying if I didn't feel like that sometimes,\" Van Ness said. \"And so, I think it's really beautiful, and I think we do need to center what is best for us sometimes and my hat off to him for doing that today.\"",
      "Brent called his experience with the group transformative, saying, \"I have felt safe and supported by the people up here.

      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose case is based on 14 separate newspaper stories, says the alleged illegal information gathering between 1993 and 2011 put a \"massive strain\" on his personal relationships. He has long blamed the media for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her vehicle was pursued by photographers on motorcycles.",
      "He listened in court Monday as his lawyer argued that there was, \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"",
      "Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, will be used in the trial. CBS News' partner network BBC news reported Monday that Harry was expected to take the stand himself to offer evidence.",
      "During his first legal battle with the press, in 2019, against the owners of The Mirror for hacking his phone, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to give in-person testimony in a British court in more than 130 years. Courts ruled in his favor multiple times in that case.",
      "\"The journalists who used me and the editors who sanctioned this knew full well that I was a practitioner of the 'Dark Arts,'\" private investigator Steve Whittamore said in a witness statement ahead of the trial that began Monday. \"If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately \u2026 then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.\"",
      "Another witness, known as \"Detective Danno,\" claims to have been paid the equivalent of more than $1 million by the Mail for over 20 years of work for the paper.",
      "The publisher has argued that evidence from private detectives can't be trusted.",
      "Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, said Monday that Prince William appeared to be \"full of confidence\" about his case, but \"he's not really relishing the prospect of being in court all week.\"",
      "Last year, Rupert Murdoch's right-leaning News Group Newspapers settled out of court with the royal, offering a full formal apology for \"serious intrusion\" and a multi-million dollar payout.",
      "The case against Associated Newspapers is expected to last nine weeks, culminating with a decision by Judge Matthew Nicklin, whose verdict will determine not only the lasting reputation of a major media company, but also who foots the bill for tens of millions of dollars in legal costs.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Nikkhah told CBS News. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judd-apatow-on-comic-genius-mel-brooks-the-99-year-old-man/",
    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:11:15 -0500",
    "summary": "As a young boy, Judd Apatow says he wanted to grow up to be like the director of such classics as \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" Now Apatow has co-directed a two-part HBO Max documentary about his idol: \"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!\"",
    "story": [
      "At the Golden Globes last week, Judd Apatow cracked up the room: \"I'm very honored to be asked to present the award for best director, because I'm pretty sure that means the Globes people think I'm also one of the best directors.\"",
      "But Apatow is more at home behind the camera, as a director of comedies like \"The 40 Year Old Virgin,\" and of documentaries about some of his idols, like comedians Garry Shandling and George Carlin.",
      "His latest subject hardly needs an introduction.",
      "Asked why he decided to do a documentary about Mel Brooks, Apatow said, \"Mel is the reason why most of us went into comedy. You know, when I was a kid (I was born in 1967), all these Mel Brooks movies came out while I was a little kid and trying to figure out what the world meant and who I was. And here was this hilarious, tiny Jewish man who was really loud and brash and confident, and seemed like the coolest guy in the world. And I think me and a lot of people thought, 'Oh, that's the job you would want. You would want to be Mel Brooks.'\"",
      "\"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man\" streams this week on HBO Max. Co-directed by Michael Bonfiglio, it's the surprisingly personal origin story of a comedy legend \u2013 a Brooklyn kid raised by a single mom whose four sons went off to war.",
      "In the documentary, Brooks described his wartime experience:",
      "Brooks: \"I was sent from a provincial tenement in Brooklyn to France, 1104th engineer combat battalion.\"Apatow: \"And the Germans had just left France?\"Brooks: \"Yeah.\"Apatow: \"And so your job was to make sure they didn't leave behind booby traps?\"Brooks\" \"Right. Forty-five degree angle with your bayonet, go through the soil, find, find, find, dink dink. Oh, oh!\"",
      "\"I said to him, you know, \"Did you ever think that you were gonna die?'\" Apatow recalled. \"And he goes, 'Only every second of every day.'\"",
      "Brooks came home from the war, but he never really stopped fighting the Nazis \u2013 lampooning them in \"The Producers,\" \"To Be or Not to Be,\" and \"History of the World Part I.\"",
      "Asked what made Nazis such a frequent target of Brooks, Apatow said, \"The fear that it was gonna happen again. And then if you don't keep pointing out how horrifying this is, then it can, you know, slowly bubble back up, which is something we see right now.\"",
      "And Brooks was equally fearless against racism. His 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" is the story of a Black sheriff in a racist town. Critics were divided over the raunchy comedy, but it was a monster hit with moviegoers. And just a few months later, he came out with another monster hit, \"Young Frankenstein.\"",
      "What did releasing two big hits in the same year do for Brooks' status? \"He just became Beyonc\u00e9 for a little while,\" Apatow said. \"I mean, he was a real sensation. And it was kind of shocking, right, that two of the best comedies of all time come out in the same year. And we didn't talk about this in the documentary, but there was some sense that 'Blazing Saddles' was so daring that maybe he made sure to make another movie, so that if they really turned on him with 'Blazing Saddles,' he already had another one to show 'em.\"",
      "It wasn't all just for laughs:\u00a0 Mel Brooks also produced dramas, like David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man,\" but he did it quietly, refusing to put his name on it. \"He thought it was a distraction, and you would think the movie was silly 'cause his name was on it,\" Apatow said. \"But yet, it said Brooksfilms. So, I think people figured it out. I think he should put his name on there.\"",
      "No history of Mel Brooks' life would be complete without a mention of his best friend, comedy giant Carl Reiner. \"It's one of the great friendships of all time, because they were friends for, I mean, 70 years? Maybe more?\" Apatow said. \"You know, some people are just magic together. They just fit. And they adored each other more than I've ever seen two people adore and respect each other. I asked him, you know, 'What is the core of this?' And he said, 'He's my father.'\"",
      "Reiner was actually only four years older, but Brooks looked up to him, and later in life, as widowers, they leaned on one another. [Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, died in 2005; Estelle Reiner died in 2008.]",
      "Apatow said the loss of Bancroft was very hard on Brooks: \"He famously would go eat dinner and watch a movie with Carl Reiner at Carl Reiner's house, and he did that for many, many years. And they supported each other. And that's how both of them got through it. And then after Carl died, Mel would go to Carl's house alone and eat dinner and watch a movie. And I asked him why. And he said, 'Because it feels like he's there in some way.'\"",
      "Brooks, who will turn 100 in June, has two Oscars, four Emmys, and the Broadway version of his hit movie \"The Producers\" has 12 Tonys \u2013 a record that still stands today. He also won three Grammys, giving him rare EGOT status.",
      "What's more, he's lived long enough to see how his work endures, in his films, and in the countless comedians he inspired.",
      "Asked what Brooks thought his legacy was, Apatow replied, \"He said he thought he was put on this Earth to make people laugh, and he did that.\"",
      "\"What do you think Mel Brooks' legacy is?\" I asked.",
      "\"The main one is probably the funniest person of all time, and the creator of some of the best films of all time, one of the great Broadway musicals of all time, who had the courage to make comedy, both about unimportant things and the most important things, and he did it longer than anybody,\" Apatow said.",

    "story": [
      "Actor Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd may be well-known in Sweden \u2013 his picture is prominently displayed at the airport \u2013 but he dismisses that it is a big deal. \"Sweden is a small country!\" he laughs.",
      "He's self-effacing, and while Skarsg\u00e4rd was recognized during our stroll through his hometown of Stockholm, respectful, shy Swedes may help keep any Hollywood-actor-ego in check. Skarsg\u00e4rd noted, \"They don't say like Americans \u2013 OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!!!\"",
      "He's recognizable from any number of roles over the decades, from Hollywood blockbusters (\"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\"), popular streaming shows (\"Andor\"), European art-house fare (\"Breaking the Waves\"), and even an ABBA musical.",
      "I said, \"This morning I was watching you singing in 'Mamma Mia'...\"",
      "\"Oh. Watching is okay, but listening to it?\" Skarsg\u00e4rd laughed. \"I've tried to get into projects where I enjoy myself and have a fun time. And that's why I'm not bored. I made 150 films. I still love it, you know?\"",
      "\"It seems impossible to make that many films,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, some are very short.\"",
      "His break came at age 16 on Swedish television, in \"Bombi Bitt och jag.\" Now, at 74, he's reached a new high, in the Norwegian film \"Sentimental Value.\" He plays a once-successful filmmaker trying to reconcile with his estranged daughters.",
      "He described getting the role as a chef's kiss.",
      "\"You think this is the best role for you ever?\" I asked.",
      "\"Maybe \u2013 I don't know,\" Skarsg\u00e5rd replied.",
      "He picked up a Golden Globe for his performance just last week.",
      "He has many moments in the film where the camera just watches him, where he's not saying much, but he is saying a lot with his expression. \"I love that stuff,\" he said. \"Movies, real movies are not literature. Cinema to me is what happens in the image. Not what is said; what is not said.\"",
      "In the film, he plays a father of two. In real life he's the father of eight. All live nearby, and all have worked in the film industry, five of them actors. \"It's insane,\" he said of the \"family business.\" \"I mean, what is the chance? I didn't encourage them. They have no illusions about the business. They see I am I'm happy and I'm enjoying what I'm doing, so they probably learn from that.\"",
      "He playfully sparred with one of his sons, Alexander, when the two were nominated for the same Gotham Award last year.",
      "Alexander: \"'Sentimental Value,' beautiful film. You play yourself, right?\"Stellan: \"That's an insult.\"Alexander: \"Absentee father.\"",
      "I asked Stellan, \"Did you ever find that you had difficulty in balancing family and career?\"",
      "\"I sort of made sure that I was at home a lot,\" he replied. \"You can't be a perfect father always. I mean, you gotta accept, and the kids have to accept, I'm flawed. Good luck!\"",
      "At Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, he recalled appearing in Moliere's \"The School of Wives,\" but stumbled on the name of his co-star. \"That's what I'm talking about,\" he said. \"Had a stroke. That makes me forget my language, forget words, and that makes me more stupid and makes me less funny and everything.\"",
      "\"Do you really feel that? Less funny?\"",
      "\"I felt so funny before.\"",
      "\"Must be tough.\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, I'm 74 years old, and I'm alive.\"",
      "Since that 2022 stroke, he wears an earpiece on set to help with lines. \"It's actually more complicated than learning the lines, because the prompter has to say their line while the other actor is talking,\" he said.",
      "He wore it while shooting \"Sentimental Value,\" a film about the pull between career and what's really important.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"I've had kids in the '70s, in the '80s, in the '90s, in the '00s, and in the '10s.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you learn more from having kids for five decades, or making 150 films?\"",
      "\"Maybe I couldn't have made 150 films if I hadn't have eight kids to learn from,\" he replied. \"I stole things from them. Like, expressions and the sort of naive attitude towards everything. Just watching them is fantastic.\"",
      "It's a curiosity in humanity that Skarsg\u00e5rd explores, and expresses, through acting. \"It is like being a child,\" he said. \"You never grow up. You're allowed to play all the time, even as an adult.\"",

      "Busfield was ordered held without bond. He appeared remotely via a video link from jail. Whether he remains in jail will be the subject of a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "Albuquerque police\u00a0issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which was filmed in Albuquerque.",
      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",

      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield allegedly touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.

      "Data from the Federal Reserve shows that the so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy\u00a0in America is alive and well, with low- and middle-income households falling further behind as the richest Americans pull away.",
      "The top 1% of households owned 31.7% of all U.S. wealth in the third quarter of 2025, the highest share on record since the Federal Reserve began tracking household wealth in 1989. That share has increased even as wealth growth for the rest of the population has stalled or slowed, the data shows.",

      "The latest snapshot of wealth inequality comes as billionaire fortunes continue to grow rapidly, both in the U.S. and abroad.

      "Widening wealth inequality isn't new to the U.S., with the trend reaching back decades. However, the gap between the rich and the poor has become more skewed since the pandemic, according to Zandi.",
      "Consumer spending patterns underscore those disparities. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for nearly half of all U.S. consumer spending, according to Zandi's analysis of Federal Reserve data.",
      "The growing divide is being driven in part by surging stock prices, Zandi said.",
      "The stock market posted strong gains last year, thanks in large part to investments in artificial intelligence. Wealthier households tend to benefit most from bull markets because a larger share of their wealth is invested in stocks and other securities.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",

      "The two have publicly sparred after O'Leary said he would not install WiFi gear from Starlink, the Musk-owned maker of satellite internet gear, on Ryanair planes out of concern that the extra weight from the system's antennas would drive up fuel costs.",
      "\"It is a terrific system. It works very well,\" O'Leary said.\u00a0 \"The problem is if you put it on board aircraft, there is a cost of that of about $200 million, $250 million a year, including the cost of installation and then the fuel drag.\"",
      "Starlink did not respond to a request for comment. Musk's SpaceX company developed Starlink to provide internet connectivity, launching its first batch of satellites in 2019.",
      "Ryanair declined to comment. The airline seized on the brouhaha on Tuesday to launch what it called a \"big idiot seat sale,\" offering 100,000 seats for 16.99 Euros for one-way fares.",

      "O'Leary said Wednesday that Ryanair had explored equipping its jets with Starlink's service, including meeting with executives from the telecom company, but ultimately rejected the idea.",
      "After O'Leary relayed that decision last week, Musk said on social media that the airline leader was \"misinformed.\" O'Leary subsequently told an Irish radio station that \"I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk, he's an idiot.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:12:40 -0500",
    "summary": "What's a \"peanut butter\" raise? Here's what it means, and why this is the type of pay hike you should expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Your 2026 pay raise could be a \"peanut-butter\"-style increase, with new research from compensation expert Payscale finding more than four in 10 companies are opting to give identical, across-the-board hikes rather than merit-based raises.",
      "This year, 44% of companies plan to rely on the peanut-butter approach \u2014 a method of evenly spreading pay hikes across the workforce \u2014 according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Payscale.",
      "Some employers are moving away from performance-based pay increases because of concerns that the practice is too subjective and potentially biased, Payscale noted. Spreading pay hikes out evenly across a workforce is also easier from an administrative perspective, which can save companies money.",
      "Pay hikes will hold steady at 3.5% in 2026, unchanged from 2025, the group found. Still, merit-based pay hikes remain the predominant method used by companies, with 48% of organizations saying they plan to rely on performance-based raises, Payscale said.",
      "For a worker earning $65,000, a 3.5% annual raise would amount to an additional $2,275 a year.",
      "There are downsides to peanut-butter raises, as they can discourage some employees from putting in extra effort if they don't expect they'll be rewarded for going the extra mile, Payscale said.",
      "\"With no differentiation based on performance, it's easier to give everyone something. But there is a risk that top performers will feel disadvantaged in that environment,\" Ruth Thomas, chief compensation strategist at Payscale, told CBS News.",
      "She noted that companies that eschew merit-based pay increases can still reward top performers with bonuses or promotions, for example.",
      "\"Base pay is not your only lever, and organizations may look more at bonuses and promotions when base pay budgets are restricted,\" she added.",
      "Peanut-butter raises started gaining traction after the Great Recession as budget-constrained companies turned to the strategy, Thomas said. She added that more companies are once again tightening their budgets.",
      "\"We're now seeing a slow decline in pay increase budgets again, so it's easier to give everyone a relatively flat increase,\" Thomas said.",
      "Small company, big raise",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-10-percent-credit-card-rate-cap-banks-january-20/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:01:30 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year 10% cap on credit card rates starting Jan. 20. Here's what credit card companies are doing.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had set Jan. 20 as a deadline for credit card companies to lower their interest rates to 10% for one year. Now that the date has arrived, most banks and card issuers have largely kept their rates unchanged, while also pushing back against an idea that they say lacks key policy details necessary for them to comply.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the cap on Jan. 9, giving banks and issuers just 11 days to meet his demand. In his Truth Social post announcing the proposal, he said he wanted to ensure that Americans wouldn't get \"'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration.\"",
      "The interest rate cap has drawn bipartisan support from some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. If enacted, the proposal could save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments, but the banking industry warns that it could backfire because issuers would be forced to reduce credit access to millions of consumers.",
      "Credit card rates have been sliding lower during the past year, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's series of 2025 rate cuts. The average APR stood at 19.7% at the end of December, a full percentage point lower than the record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.",
      "And many banks offer zero-percent APR cards, which typically provide cards with no interest for an introductory period of, say, 12 to 15 months. After that period, the cards' APRs can rise to a range of roughly 17% to 27%, depending on a consumer's credit score. Mr. Trump's proposal would cap those rates to 10%, as well as any other card that's currently above that level.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Mr. Trump expects credit card companies to comply with the demand.",
      "\"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\" she said Jan. 16.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how it will enforce the policy or determine if banks are complying with the new proposed rule.",
      "What do experts say?",
      "Banks and bank lobbyists say they are largely in the dark on how to respond to the proposed cap.",
      "Currently, there's no law or executive order in place mandating that lenders charge no more than 10% interest on credit cards. There's also no generally applicable federal law that limits the interest rate that can be charged by a credit card company, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Experts say that a rate cap would likely require approval from Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump could seek to drum up support around a bipartisan bill, such as this one introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025, said Brian Shearer, the author of the Vanderbilt University\u00a0analysis\u00a0that found a 10% limit would save consumers $100 billion per year in interest payments.",
      "If that bill became law, Mr. Trump could force banks to comply. But mandating a rate cap through an executive action may not be enforceable, he said.",
      "How are banks responding?",
      "Because a cap on APRs would eat into bank profits, card issuers would be likely to cut off the most vulnerable borrowers from credit, banks and bank lobbyists say.",
      "Two-thirds of credit card users carrying a balance would be likely to see their credit lines reduced or canceled entirely, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0analysis from America's Credit Unions, an industry group representing credit unions. Almost all 47 million Americans with a subprime credit score would lose access to credit, the group found.",
      "By contrast, financial pros predicted the 10% cap would have little effect on higher-income bank customers.",
      "\"Americans who have investments and stable jobs aren't the ones with credit card debt. If you make $100,000, plus you're saving with a 401k, those clients will be largely unimpacted by this,\" Nick Holeman, director of financial planning at wealth advisor firm Betterment.",
      "In a Jan. 12 investor call, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would be bad for consumers and could hurt the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The bank also pointed to products it already offers consumers, including cards that offer customers introductory interest rates of 0% for up to 18 months.",
      "In the meantime, one company is stepping up to offer new credit cards that meet Mr. Trump's proposal. Bilt, a fintech company, said it is\u00a0rolling out new credit cards\u00a0that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",

      "Danish-owned AkademikerPension, which offers pension plans for academics, has used U.S. Treasuries for many years as a source of liquidity, Schelde said in his statement.",
      "The move comes as President Trump steps up his pressure campaign to acquire Greenland. Schelde claimed on Tuesday that the company's decision was \"not directly related to the ongoing rift between the US and Europe,\" adding, \"but of course that didn't make it more difficult to take the decision.\"",

    "summary": "A new BNPL pilot from financial technology company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have historically turned to buy now, pay later (BNPL) financing to cover the cost of everyday expenses like groceries and consumer purchases such as clothing and furniture. Now, some of these lending companies are turning their attention to a bigger expense: Monthly rent.",
      "A new BNPL option from fintech company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments instead of a single lump sum payment.",
      "Affirm, one of the biggest BNPL companies, told CBS News the service is starting as a limited pilot program through a partnership with New York-based company Esusu. The latter company reports consumers' payment information to the major credit agencies, according to its website.",
      "A spokesperson from Affirm said the company underwrites every application and approves only people it believes can \"responsibly afford to repay.\"",
      "\"If a tenant applies through Esusu and is approved by Affirm, they are eligible to receive a 0% interest loan to be repaid in two, biweekly installments without any fees,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"Esusu and Affirm are not offering interest-bearing loans as part of this program.\"",
      "Affirm isn't the first company to offer BNPL loans for rent payments, but it could have a wider reach, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an association of non-profit consumer organizations. Approximately 24 million Americans use Affirm's BNPL services.",
      "\"Affirm is one of the leaders in this space,\" Rust said. \"Their reach is going to be different.\"",
      "The Affirm spokesperson did not disclose how long the pilot will last or whether it plans to expand the BNPL rent option once the pilot ends. Fintech company Zip also offers a BNPL product for rent, according to trade publication PaymentsDive.",
      "BNPL comes with risks",
      "BNPL has grown in popularity because it gives consumers the option to split their payments into multiple bite-sized installments rather than paying the full cost of big-ticket items up front.",
      "A December report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that upwards of 50 million consumers took out at least one BNPL loan in 2023 from one of the six major lenders in 2023.",
      "BNPL plans typically give customers the option to pay back the cost of a purchase in four installments with no interest, according to CFPB.",
      "While this may seem like an alluring option, it can come with hidden risks. Taking out multiple loans with different deadlines can make it difficult to keep track of repayments and lead to missed payments, for which some companies charge late fees.",
      "\"It is easy to get turned around,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree.",
      "In some cases, missed BNPL payments can get reported to the credit bureaus, taking a toll on your credit score.",
      "Affirm says on its website that it's the only major BNPL service to report loan activity to U.S. credit bureaus. The San Francisco-based company shares payment information with Experian and TransUnion, two of the three main credit reporting agencies.",
      "Housing security",
      "Experts, meanwhile, have warned that BNPL can be a slippery slope that can end up pushing consumers further into debt \u2014 an issue that could pose bigger risks when dealing with monthly rent.",
      "\"You can see the problem of how borrowing could lead to a death spiral that actually threatens a tenant's housing security,\" Rust said, adding that few examples exist where tenants can borrow money to pay their rent.",
      "Schulz thinks Affirm's new option could offer tenants more flexibility, but said it could also cause people to overextend themselves.",
      "\"They might feel like they can afford a bigger monthly rent because they're able to spread the cost out over multiple paychecks,\" he said. \"That's a pretty risky game.\"",
      "Still, Schulz thinks BNPL for rent will only continue to grow in popularity as people seek out flexible payment options.",
      "\"Lenders and businesses are clearly seeing the demand for these types of offerings, and I'd suspect that we will only see more of these loans in the near future,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel's acquisition last year by Japan's Nippon Steel came with a notable condition to win approval from the Trump administration: a so-called \"golden share\" that gives President Trump the power to approve certain major corporate decisions, including closing plants or changing locations. But CEO David Burritt tells CBS News, \"There's nothing in this golden share that prevents us from doing what we want to do.\"",
      "\"We're aligned with what the president wants us to do. In fact, we wouldn't agree to this thing if we weren't sure it was going to be great for our workers and great for our company,\" Burritt told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil at one of the company's plants in Pittsburgh.",
      "Burritt downplayed some of the provisions in the deal, saying there were certain aspects that would need approval, such as changing the company's name or being forced to follow existing trade laws, that don't have any impact on what U.S. Steel's plans were to begin with.",
      "But asked if the company would require Mr. Trump's approval for business decisions down the line, such as closing a plant, Burritt insisted, \"We don't see us closing the plant. In fact, we just did have an opening here because of demand increasing at Granite City [Illinois].\"",
      "Burritt said, despite Mr. Trump's own claims last year, that the president did not veto the company's decision to close down the Granite City operation, which had been dormant since 2023. He said the company recently restarted a blast furnace at the location due to increased customer demand.",
      "Burritt acknowledged that in the future, \"If we had to make a difficult business decision, we would have to get approval to close a plant.\"",
      "\"But we don't see a reason to do that,\" he added.",
      "\"We can't guarantee things are going to stay open,\" Burritt said. \"We are going to manage the business and we're going to keep a great relationship with this administration, who did so much for us and the United States, to help get this deal done.\"",
      "Burritt touted the acquisition, saying, \"Without the partnership, we would not be able to invest as much money as what we are now. ... This is really a wonderful thing for the workers, and the workers are the ones who made this happen.\"",
      "He also highlighted the $14 billion investment from the deal that, he says, the company will be spending in the coming years, supporting as many as \"100,000 direct or indirect jobs.\"",
      "Burritt said, despite the acquisition, U.S. Steel is \"absolutely\" still a U.S. company.",
      "\"U.S. Steel Corporation: That's our brand. That's our name. Headquartered right here in Pittsburgh, and we're gonna keep it there and continue to build here,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a fiduciary duty to national security. And we have a fiduciary duty to Nippon. We keep them aligned and it's a beautiful thing,\" he said, adding: \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Burritt called Mr. Trump's tariffs a \"game changer,\" saying, \"We really appreciate that the tariffs are in place. This strengthens national security, economic security and also makes sure we have job security and creates jobs.\"",

    "story": [
      "As homeowners across the U.S. prepare to file their taxes this season, they may be wondering what deductions they qualify for and whether it's worth itemizing or sticking with the standard deduction.",
      "As in every tax season, a filer's situation will hinge on multiple factors.",
      "\"Everyone's situation is different,\" said Kate Wood, a lending expert from NerdWallet. \"It's hard to say kind of how everything is going to stack up for most homeowners, because so much will depend on your income and then also where you live.\"",
      "Still, it can pay \u2014 quite literally \u2014 to be prepared.",
      "The deductions available to homeowners are fairly consistent with years past, with a few changes following last year's passage of the Republicans' new tax and spending law.",
      "The IRS will start accepting tax returns on Jan. 26.",
      "What deductions can I claim as a homeowner?",
      "The mortgage interest deduction remains one of the chief tax breaks for homeowners.",
      "However, fewer people have claimed this since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which nearly doubled the size of the standard deduction, Wood said. Still, it remains an option for taxpayers who itemize \u2014 meaning they add up eligible expenses such as mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations, and claim them only if the combined total exceeds the standard deduction.",
      "The standard deduction for 2025 is $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.",
      "Filers can deduct up to $750,000 of mortgage debt, or up to $375,000 for married people who file separately, according to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Other common deductions for homeowners, according to NerdWallet, include:",
      "Home equity loan and home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest.\u00a0\u00a0Filers can only take this deduction if the money was spent on qualifying home improvements. \"Say you took out a home equity loan because you were trying to consolidate other debt, or something like that,\" Wood said. \"In that case, the interest would not be deductible.\"Home office expenses. People who are self-employed and who work from home can write off expenses they paid related to their business, including rent, utilities and real estate taxes.

      "What's new this year?",
      "There are two main changes this year for homeowners stemming from the \"big, beautiful bill\" act that President Trump signed into law last year.",
      "The first is the expansion of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The \"big, beautiful bill\" Act raises the cap from $10,000 to $40,000, allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $40,000 in combined property taxes and either state and local income taxes or sales taxes.",
      "Single filers can now deduct up to to $40,000, while married couples can deduct up to $20,000 each if they are filing separately. The deduction phases out for people with adjusted gross incomes over $500,000.",
      "The degree to which any given filer will benefit from the higher SALT cap will depend on where they live, the type of property they own and the amount they pay in property taxes, Wood said.",
      "\"If you're someone who has a large, high-interest-rate mortgage, and you're living in a high property tax area, you could potentially get a significant boost from itemizing,\" she said. \"But if you're someone who's paying low interest, has a modest mortgage, is in a lower tax location, the standard deduction might be just fine for you.\"",
      "The second major change homeowners should be aware of is the elimination of energy-focused\u00a0home improvement tax credits, which were phased out at the end of 2025 under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The credits were intended to help taxpayers offset the cost of clean-energy upgrades, such as installing solar panels or improving insulation.",
      "To qualify for the credits this tax season, homeowners must have completed their energy upgrades in 2025, Wood said. \"Not just that you purchased the items, but that the work was completed by Dec. 31, 2025,\" she said.",

      "The forum is a think tank and event organizer based in Geneva whose main event \u2014 the annual meeting \u2014 debuted in 1971 in Davos, a ski-resort town of about 10,000 people at a height of about 1,500 meters (nearly 5,000 feet) in the Alps of eastern Switzerland.",
      "The first edition, hosted by forum founder Klaus Schwab, featured a gathering of business executives.",
      "Since then, the meeting has swelled into a catch-all conference on issues as diverse as economic disparity, climate change, technology, and global cooperation \u2014 as well as competition and conflict.",
      "This year's event runs from Jan. 19-23.",
      "What is the theme at this year's Davos forum?",
      "Davos conference organizers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year's is \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" \u2014 around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues.",
      "Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.",
      "The world's richest people saw their fortunes surge in 2025, part of a long-running trend of widening wealth inequality, according to a\u00a0new report from anti-poverty charity Oxfam released to coincide with the forum. The wealth of billionaires grew three times faster last year than the average pace of the previous five years, reaching a record $18.3 trillion, the group said.",
      "At the same time, one in four people worldwide experiences food insecurity and regularly skips meals, Oxfam said.",
      "\"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable,\" said Oxfam executive director Amitabh Behar in a statement.",
      "Who will attend in 2026?",
      "Organizers says a record of nearly 400 top political leaders, including more than 60 heads of state and government, and nearly 850 chairs and chief executives of many of the world's leading companies.",
      "Headlining the lineup is U.S. President Donald Trump, who's set to deliver a speech on Wednesday, and several Cabinet ministers and top advisers including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, President Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Felix Tshisekedi of Congo, Vice Premier He Lifeng of China, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine are among the who's-who of top attendees.",
      "Organizers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.",
      "Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France's Mistral AI.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are among scores of top officials from international institutions.",
      "What other issues are at stake?",
      "The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump's pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran \u2014 not to mention his tariff policies \u2014 have raised questions about America's role in the world.",
      "The advent of AI \u2014 its promise and perils \u2014 has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labor leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and right to innovate.",

      "A Georgia-based food company has recalled thousands of pounds of ready-to-eat chicken products, which were sold in seven different states, after determining the products may have been contaminated with listeria, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0announced.",
      "Suzanna's Kitchen, headquartered in Norcross, Georgia, recalled roughly 13,720 pounds of its ready-to-eat grilled chicken breast fillet products, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the Department of Agriculture.",
      "The recalled products were produced on Oct. 14, 2025, and sold in 10-pound cases containing two 5-pound bags of cooked grilled chicken breast fillets with rib meat, health officials said. They were sent to distribution centers for food service sales in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio.",
      "There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the consumption of the recalled products. Officials said the problem was discovered by a third-party laboratory, which tested the chicken fillets and reported a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes, a type of disease-causing bacteria that can infect people when they eat food that has been contaminated with it.",
      "The bacteria can be found in a number of places, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including soil, water, sewage, vegetation and animals. It can survive and grow even when products it contaminates are refrigerated, and is generally transmitted when food is \"harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported, or stored in manufacturing or production environments contaminated with L. monocytogenes,\" the FDA says.",
      "Listeria infections are the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that 1,250 people contract the infection each year and 172 people die from it.",
      "Although no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled products from Suzanna's Kitchen, officials have encouraged anyone with concerns to contact a healthcare provider.",
      "Cases and packaging of potentially contaminated meat have the establishment number P-1382 inside the USDA mark of inspection. They also have the lot code 60104 P1382 287 5 J14.",

      "The Trump administration is delaying its plans to withhold pay from student loan borrowers who default on their payments, backing off a measure that threatened to deliver a financial blow to millions of Americans.",
      "The Education Department announced Friday that involuntary collections on federal student loans will remain on hold as the agency finalizes new repayment plans. The shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause.",
      "Nicholas Kent, the department's higher education chief, said the agency is \"committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options.\"",
      "\"The Department determined that involuntary collection efforts such as Administrative Wage Garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program will function more efficiently and fairly after the Trump Administration implements significant improvements to our broken student loan system,\" Kent said in a statement.",
      "Federal student loan borrowers can have their wages garnished and their federal tax refunds withheld if they default on their loans, meaning they are at least 270 days behind on payments. The penalties were put on hold during a pandemic-era pause on student loan payments that the Trump administration lifted.",
      "Last spring, Trump officials said they would resume targeting tax refunds for borrowers in default. In December, officials said they would restart wage garnishment in January, with initial notices being sent to 1,000 borrowers the week of Jan. 7.",
      "Both penalties \u2014 withholding wages and federal payments \u2014 are being paused, according to the Friday announcement.",
      "The department did not set a new date for involuntary collections. It said the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.",
      "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon indicated earlier this week that the department was planning to pause wage garnishment efforts in remarks to local reporters in Rhode Island.",
      "More than 5 million Americans were in default on their federal student loans as of September, according to department data. Millions more have fallen behind on loan payments and are at risk of going into default this year. Nearly 10% of borrowers were delinquent by more than 90 days in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Payments on student loans were paused from March 2020 to April 2023, and for a one-year grace period after that, borrowers who missed payments could avoid default. The Education Department announced in May that it would resume collections activity.",
      "McMahon said earlier this week that \"we had an incredible falloff in people repaying their loans\" during the pandemic-era pause.",
      "Friday's announcement was welcomed by student loan advocates who urged the department not to resume wage garnishment.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it has completed the first sale of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. \u2014 a shipment the president valued at $500 million.",
      "It's part of the administration's push to tap into Venezuela's oil reserves, some of the largest in the world.",
      "What does that mean for U.S. drivers?",
      "Gas is currently at $2.67 a gallon nationally, the lowest it's been since May 2021. But prices have been steadily declining since last November, weeks before the U.S. military operation\u00a0that captured Venezuela's autocratic leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Will Venezuelan oil push prices even lower?",
      "Economists are divided on when or how much these developments may affect consumer prices.",
      "\"If I know prices are going to be lower in the future because I expect this Venezuelan crude, that'll impact prices now,\" said Dr. Ian Lange, a professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines. He also served as a senior economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump's first term.",
      "However, others say it's too soon for Venezuela to be a factor at the pump.",
      "\"It's far too early for any measurable impact on what consumers are paying at the pump \u2014 whether prices go up or down \u2014 as it would likely take years to see a meaningful increase in oil output there,\" wrote Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, in their weekly price update.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. imported nearly 3.1 billion barrels of crude oil, and just 2.75% came from Venezuela. Even before 2019 sanctions, Venezuelan oil made up roughly 8% of yearly U.S. imports \u2014 about the same share Mexico holds today.",
      "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied 1 to 1.8 million barrels per day to the United States. Now the country's current production caps at 750,000 barrels per day.",
      "Returning to that higher level of production, if possible, wouldn't necessarily be a good thing for the global oil supply chain.",
      "\"A big ramp-up in production from Venezuela would sort of add to an already oversupplied market,\" said Lange.",
      "In any case, that ramp-up in production hasn't happened yet.\u00a0Venezuela's oil infrastructure\u00a0has suffered from years of underinvestment, corruption and sanctions, and so far, U.S. companies appear\u00a0reluctant to invest\u00a0in rebuilding it.",
      "\"It could take years of positive developments for additional supply to meaningfully move the needle,\" said De Haan. \"The impact on U.S. gasoline prices may ultimately be limited.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Canadian crude has dominated U.S. heavy oil imports while sanctions have virtually ceased Venezuelan shipments.",
      "Canada now supplies the majority of the heavy crude that American refineries need.",
      "\"It's certainly possible that a large increase in the oil coming out of Venezuela outcompetes Canadian oil, even as most of our refineries are going to be in the Gulf Coast,\" Lange said.",
      "But Lange says Venezuela is not ready to compete in that way right now. It depends on concessions from the Venezuelan government to U.S. energy producers.",
      "Why the U.S. needs heavy crude oil",
      "The U.S. is one of the world's largest oil producers. So why Import billions of barrels per year?",
      "It comes down to the type of oil. The U.S. produces mostly \"light crude,\" which is less dense and cheaper to refine. But American refineries, especially those along the Gulf Coast, are designed to process a mix of light and heavy crude.",
      "\"Most of our production of crude oil in the United States is on the light side, and most refineries need a mix of light and heavy,\" Lange said. \"Right now, we get a lot of our heavies from Canada, which may be supplemented by Venezuela in the near future.\"",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves total roughly 300 billion barrels \u2014 about 17% of the world's proven reserves. Much of it is heavy rude, exactly what Gulf Coast refineries need.",
      "If Venezuela can ramp up production, it could mean competition with Canada \u2014 and that's good for consumers, according to Lange.",
      "\"Refineries would pay less as they play the Canadians and the Venezuelans off each other,\" Lange said. \"And that would lead to a lower price of refined products for the end consumer.\"",
      "Can prices drop too low?",
      "More oil sounds good for drivers. But flooding an already oversupplied market carries risks.",
      "If crude prices fall too far, American producers start to cut back. Light crude \u2014 the kind that the U.S. produces \u2014 would become less profitable to drill. The going price for a barrel of oil, roughly 42 gallons, is just over $60.",
      "Experts caution scaling back would mean closing down refineries and cutting industry jobs in places like Texas and the Dakotas.",
      "\"If we don't import crude, we'd close a refinery. And that's not good,\" Lange said. \"That's jobs and economic activity.\"",
      "The cycle of supply and demand continues. If domestic production slows, supply tightens and prices rise again.",

Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",

      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, The Hamilton Project at Brookings found in a 2023\u00a0study.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "story": [
      "In the hours before his game, on a mild February night in 2024 inside the on-campus Corbett sports center in Greensboro, North Carolina, Camian Shell allegedly sent a heart emoji in response to a text message he'd just received. By the end of the game, Shell's North Carolina A&T men's basketball team would suffer a huge halftime deficit and an eventual 84-58 defeat.",
      "Shell's heart emoji is now evidence in one of the largest and most sweeping federal investigations into alleged point shaving in college sports.",
      "Shell, who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last week in Philadelphia federal court, is one of more than a dozen college athletes accused of accepting bribes from gamblers to take a dive and deliberately tank their performance on the court.",
      "According to charging documents, a co-conspirator texted Shell a request to shave points before one February 2024 game. Prosecutors alleged Shell sent the emoji in response to the text and \"underperformed in and influenced the first half as they had agreed.\"",
      "The conspiracy allegedly corrupted nearly 30 NCAA basketball games in 2024 and 2025.",
      "The case comes just months after two Major League Baseball pitchers were charged with allegedly rigging individual pitches, in an alleged conspiracy with gamblers. In recent months, an NBA player has also been charged by federal prosecutors with conspiring with gamblers to underperform on the court, to help bettors secure victorious wagers.",
      "This series of high-profile cases \u2014 which follow a rapid nationwide expansion of legal sports gambling \u2014 has triggered calls for the leagues to create and empower an internal investigative agency to police for illicit gambling schemes and misconduct by players and other employees.",
      "One proposal, released by former federal corruption prosecutor Carolyn Pokorny, recommends an \"inspector general for sports integrity,\" which is funded by the leagues but operates independently.",
      "\"When your reputation and your business model are at stake, you just can't investigate yourself credibly. You need someone with independence to do it,\" Pokorny told CBS News.",
      "Pokorny said the recent criminal sports gambling investigations by the Justice Department have exposed vulnerabilities in the major sports leagues and risk damaging the sports' brands.",
      "Pokorny, who previously oversaw sports gaming cases in the Eastern District of New York, said the Justice Department has only limited bandwidth to root out unlawful gaming in sports.",
      "Pokorny told CBS News, \"Those kinds of prosecutions are really critical. But you have to keep in mind that prosecutors are stretched very thin, and they have a huge mandate. They're handling terrorism, drug cartels and human trafficking. They are not the sports integrity police.\"",
      "In a December op-ed for Bloomberg Law, Pokorny pointed to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private oversight body funded by Wall Street firms, as a \"working model for how this could be done.\" Pokorny said the leagues could work in collaboration to have a single inspector general monitoring for suspicious wagers, patterns or actions. She said any individual league could also do so on its own.",
      "She compared the proposed inspector general to government inspectors general offices, which have full-time attorneys and auditing specialists who conduct audits, inspections and investigations to root out waste, fraud and abuse. They also monitor for misconduct and vulnerabilities to fraud and criminal misconduct.",
      "In response to a request for comment on Pokorny's proposal, the NCAA pointed to its\u00a0existing enforcement efforts, which it described as \"one of the largest integrity monitoring programs in the world.\" The collegiate sports organization also noted that it has called for an end to \"prop bets,\" or wagers on things other than a game's final outcome, including the performance of individual players. The NCAA said prop bets pose \"integrity risks.\"",
      "The NFL and MLB declined to comment to CBS News. The NBA and NHL did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Justice Department's NCAA basketball gambling investigation required nearly two years to fully uncover, spanning 26 criminal defendants. Most of the games that were allegedly impacted took place in early 2024. Prosecutors said the bribes could range between $10,000 and $30,000 per game. The people behind the alleged scheme are accused of finding games in which a corrupted player was on a team that was favored to lose and then bribing the player to deliberately underperform during the game and not cover the point spread.",
      "Games involving the following teams were allegedly rigged or impacted, investigators say: North Carolina A&T, Towson, Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Butler, DePaul, Duquesne, East Carolina, Florida Atlantic, Fordham, Georgetown, Kennesaw State, Kent State, La Salle, McNeese State, Nicholls State, Ohio University, St. Louis University, St. John's, SUNY Buffalo, Tulane and Western Michigan University.",
      "An attorney for Shell would not comment when reached by CBS News.",
      "In response to the case, NCAA President Charlie Baker issued a statement which, in part, said the revelations were \"not entirely new information to the NCAA.\"",
      "\"Through helpful collaboration and with industry regulators, we have finished or have open investigations into almost all of the teams in today's indictment,\" Baker said at the time.",
      "An internal investigation by the NBA also led the league to ban Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter in April 2024 for allegedly giving information about his health status to gamblers. Porter pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy later that year.",
      "Pokorny told CBS News that internal investigations by the professional leagues and NCAA are helpful but not sufficient to root out the spread of gambling schemes.",
      "\"It's private industry. They can do what they want,\" she said, referring to the idea of appointing an independent inspector general. \"I think they can do this today, and the business case for doing it [in] sports betting is: It's a multi-billion dollar industry to protect.\"",
      "Sports business reporter John Ourand, who covers the leagues, media and industry for digital news outlet Puck, said there is still little, if any, indication the sports gambling cases have hurt the bottom lines of pro sports leagues or NCAA \u2014 at least not yet.",

    "summary": "Paul Schnell, Minnesota's corrections commissioner, rejects DHS' claims that state authorities have been releasing hundreds of dangerous criminals, rather than turning them over to ICE.",
    "story": [
      "A top Minnesota law enforcement official is rejecting repeated accusations by the Department of Homeland Security that state authorities have been releasing hundreds of dangerous criminals into the streets, rather than turning them over to federal immigration agents.",
      "Paul Schnell, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, called the claims \"fundamentally false\" and warned that such federal messaging risks undermining public trust in both immigration enforcement and public safety.",
      "\"We cooperate with ICE and ICE detainers,\" Schnell told CBS News in an interview on Wednesday. \"We have, as a matter of policy, done that for a long, long time. How they can say otherwise is unbelievable.\"",
      "It came after Marcos Charles, ICE's acting executive associate director for Enforcement and Removal Operations on Tuesday accused Minnesota officials of failing to turn people over to federal custody \u2014 and claimed there were more than 1,360 pending ICE detainers statewide.",
      "Those are federal requests to local law enforcement to detain individuals for up to 48 hours after they're set to be released from criminal confinement \u2014 which gives ICE time to decide whether to take them into custody to begin deportation proceedings.",
      "\"The best solution is to turn them over to us in a safe, controlled setting like a jail or prison instead of releasing them back onto the streets,\" Charles said at a news conference in St. Paul, Tuesday, warning that releases put communities \"where your children go to school\" at risk.",
      "But the Department of Corrections commissioner said those coordinated turnovers are already happening \u2014 and have been for years, as a matter of policy and state law. Schnell said his department routinely communicates with ICE in the weeks before an incarcerated person's release to arrange handoffs if a detainer is in place. And according to Minnesota corrections data, 84 people were transferred directly from state prisons to ICE custody in 2025.",
      "To better understand the scope of the issue, Schnell said his department conducted a statewide survey. They found 207 individuals in state prisons and 94 in county jails are subject to ICE detainers \u2014 301 total. This is far short of the 1,360 cited by federal officials.",
      "\"We cannot explain how those numbers square,\" Schnell said. \"And nobody is sitting down with us to explain it.\"",
      "Schnell told CBS News his agency has repeatedly asked DHS to reconcile the discrepancy but has received no documentation showing missed transfers or failures to comply.",
      "\"If we made a mistake, we would own it,\" he said. \"But to date, no one has shown us where we failed.\"",
      "Asked for comment on Schnell's remarks, a DHS spokesperson reiterated the agency's assertions that hundreds of criminals have been released across Minnesota and that 1,360 people in custody statewide are subject to active ICE detainers.",
      "The spokesperson did not address the discrepancies raised by Schnell, but pointed to a list of six people with criminal charges or convictions that DHS says were released in Minnesota, and called on Gov. Tim Walz to \"commit to honoring all ICE detainers.\"",
      "In some cases, Schnell said, it is ICE that chooses not to detain individuals any longer, releasing them under federal supervision or into the community. He emphasized that this is a decision made by federal authorities, not the state.",
      "\"We didn't release them into the community,\" he said. \"We released them to ICE.\"",
      "Schnell also pushed back against the Department of Homeland Security's regular publication of so-called \"worst of the worst\" lists, which highlight individuals with serious criminal convictions ICE claims to have arrested. But Schnell insisted Minnesota corrections had coordinated with ICE to transfer custody of many of those people and called the lists \"propaganda, in many instances.\" He added that in multiple cases, federal authorities opt to release detainees after they're in ICE custody.",
      "\"These weren't people swept up on Minneapolis streets,\" he said. \"They were released to ICE. What happened after that was not our decision.\"",
      "Schnell acknowledged that compliance with civil ICE detainers varies at the county level \u2014 particularly in large jurisdictions like Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. But he also stressed that the Department of Corrections' authority is limited to the state prison system, not local jails.",
      "Despite the sharp disagreements, Schnell emphasized that day-to-day cooperation between Corrections Department staff and ICE officers on the ground remains strong.",
      "\"Staff to staff, operationally, this is working exactly the way it should,\" he said. \"Which is why I think their staff are probably equally confused.\"",
      "What he wants now, Schnell said, is a direct conversation at senior levels of DHS to reconcile data and messaging \u2014 not public accusations.",
      "\"It's in the best interest of public safety to get this right,\" he said. \"Rhetoric doesn't solve anything. Facts do.\"",
      "As immigration enforcement continues to be a flashpoint nationally and locally, the dispute underscores a deeper challenge: a fragmented system in which federal, state, and local entities operate under different authorities, with access to varying data systems \u2014 often speaking past one another in the process.",
      "\"We care deeply about public safety,\" Schnell said. \"That's why we follow this policy. And we will continue to coordinate the transfer of custody \u2014 period.\"",

    "summary": "After a year of ongoing measles outbreaks that have sickened more than 2,400 people, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country.",
    "story": [
      "After a year of ongoing measles outbreaks that have sickened more than 2,400 people, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.",
      "\"It's just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel,\" Abraham said. \"We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That's their personal freedom.\"",
      "Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only about 10% of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically. This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly prevent infection and halt the virus's spread.",
      "To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, scientists are examining whether the major outbreaks in South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.",
      "Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses \u2014 about 16,000 genetic letters long \u2014 to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in different countries.",
      "The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public. Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. And that would mean that costly, potentially deadly, and preventable measles outbreaks could become common again.",
      "\"When you hear somebody like Abraham say 'the cost of doing business,' how can you be more callous,\" said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an online discussion hosted by the health blog Inside Medicine on Jan. 20. \"Three people died of measles last year in this country,\" Offit added. \"We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 \u2014 eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of.\"",
      "Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and vaccine rates have dropped. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about 138,000 children, obtained vaccine exemptions for the 2024-25 school year.",
      "Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death.",
      "Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration's focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country's measles-free status. \"This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks,\" she said.",
      "\"If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles,\" she said. \"It's like they're trying to be graded on a curve.\"",
      "The Trump administration impeded the CDC's ability to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations. However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing. Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.",
      "If the CDC's genomic analyses show that last year's outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country's status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC's national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy's actions in August.",
      "And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country's status: \"They'll say, who cares.\"",
      "Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a reporter from Stat that a reversal in the nation's status would not be significant: \"Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread.\"",
      "Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:09:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last August. Courts have so far allowed her to continue serving in her role while litigation continues.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared likely to allow Lisa Cook to keep her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and reject\u00a0President Trump's attempt to fire her\u00a0for now.",
      "The high court heard arguments in a high-stakes case over Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook, which he attempted last August over allegations she engaged in mortgage fraud. Lower courts had allowed Cook to remain in her post while she pursued a legal challenge to her firing.",
      "The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gives the president the authority to remove a member of the Fed's Board of Governors \"for cause,\" though the law does not define the term. In informing Cook of her removal, Mr. Trump wrote in a letter shared to social media that he had \"sufficient cause\" to do so because of what he claimed was \"deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter.\"",
      "Cook has denied wrongdoing and has not been criminally charged. Mr. Trump's move to fire her was unprecedented. No other president has tried to oust a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year history.",
      "The Fed has an \"unbroken history going back to its founding in 1913 in which no president, from Woodrow Wilson to Joseph Biden has ever even tried to remove a governor for cause, despite the ever-present temptation for lower rates and easier money,\" Paul Clement, who argued on Cook's behalf, told the justices.",
      "Across the session, several members of the court expressed concern about damaging the independence of the Fed and questioned whether the allegations against Cook met the standard of \"cause\" laid out in the statute. They repeatedly focused on the posture of the case, which arrived at the Supreme Court in its early stages. Lower courts have not yet explored the facts of the dispute.",
      "Some of the justices also appeared open to Cook's argument that she was entitled to, and deprived of, notice and opportunity to respond to the allegations before she was removed. Mr. Trump had demanded on Truth Social that Cook resign and, five days later, shared the letter on social media announcing her firing.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said that Cook's firing was handled in a \"very cursory manner,\" while Justice Neil Gorsuch raised questions as to what procedures would provide her adequate due process.",
      "\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt Room where the president provides Ms. Cook \u2014 Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, give her the chance to defend herself,\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett said. \"It just wouldn't be that big of a deal, it seems, if that's enough.\"",
      "Oral arguments",
      "In defending Mr. Trump's effort to fire Cook, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that \"deceit or gross negligence\" by a financial regulator is cause for removal, and said the president has discretion to oust an officer for reasons related to her conduct, ability, fitness or competence. He argued that allowing Cook to remain in her position while her case proceeds would do \"grievous injury\" to the public's perceptions of the Fed.",
      "\"The American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who was, at best, grossly negligent in obtaining favorable interest rates for herself,\" he said.",
      "Several of the justices pressed Sauer about the consequences of a decision allowing Mr. Trump to fire Cook, and specifically the ramifications for the U.S. economy. Barrett pointed to predictions from economists that Cook's removal could trigger a recession.",
      "\"How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?\" she said, later adding that the risks to the economy may counsel caution by the Supreme Court.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh pushed Sauer on the implications of the administration's position in the case and how it would impact the Fed's independence.",
      "\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines \u2014 that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh said that if the Supreme Court accepts Mr. Trump's view, a Democratic successor could come in and fire all of his appointees, effectively turning the Fed's for-cause removal standard into at-will. Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, stressed that the court should think about the \"consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\"",
      "\"It incentives a president to come up with what, as the Federal Reserve former governors say, trivial or inconsequential or old allegations that are very difficult to disprove. It incentivizes kind of the search-and-destroy and find something and just put that on a piece of paper. No judicial review. No process, nothing, you're done,\" he said. \"What are we doing when we have a system that incentivizes that and leads to that?\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the circumstances surrounding Cook's firing-by-social-media \"irregular,\" adding that \"it certainly didn't invite an opportunity to be heard.\"",
      "Cook's case",
      "Cook sued over her removal last year, arguing that the president violated the Federal Reserve Act. She also said she was entitled to and deprived of notice and the opportunity to a hearing before she was fired.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook\u00a0and reinstated her to her post, finding that Mr. Trump had not validly removed her \"for cause.\" The judge also ruled that Cook was likely to succeed on her argument that she was deprived of her due-process rights because she did not receive the necessary process before her firing.",
      "A divided panel of three appeals court judges\u00a0continued to block Cook's removal, and the Trump administration sought emergency relief from Supreme Court and asked the justices to allow the president to oust her.",
      "The high court has\u00a0allowed Cook to remain\u00a0in her position while it considers whether Mr. Trump can fire her and is hearing the case on an expedited schedule. Cook has participated in the last two meetings of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee. Its next meeting is set for later this month.",
      "The dispute involving Cook's firing poses a test for the independence of the Fed, which defenders of the bank argue would be jeopardized if the Supreme Court rules for Mr. Trump. Arguments also come days after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell revealed the central bank received criminal subpoenas from the Justice Department stemming from a\u00a0criminal investigation\u00a0into him.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of other independent agencies and appears poised to overturn a 90-year-old decision that allowed Congress to impose removal protections for officials at multi-member boards and commissions. But it has also signaled that it views the Fed differently from those other entities.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court singled out the Fed as a \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\" Kavanaugh separately suggested in December that the court could create an exception for the central bank to the president's otherwise unrestricted power to remove certain executive officers.",
      "Unlike the case involving removal restrictions for independent agencies, the Justice Department is not challenging the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause protection. Instead, the key issues are whether Mr. Trump needed to give Cook notice and a hearing before removing her, if the president had cause to fire her \u2014 and what constitutes \"cause\" \u2014 and whether courts can review that decision.",
      "Sauer argued in Supreme Court filings that the president lawfully ousted Cook after \"concluding that the American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who made misrepresentations material to her mortgage rates that appear to have been grossly negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.\"",
      "Cook's alleged conduct \"created an intolerable appearance of impropriety in someone charged with the weightiest responsibilities in our financial system,\" he\u00a0wrote. \"There is a world of difference between that removal and removals grounded in policy disagreements.\"",
      "Sauer also told the justices in papers that courts cannot second-guess the president's determination that there was cause to fire Cook. But even if they could, Mr. Trump identified a valid reason for doing so: her \"apparent fraud or gross negligence in a financial matter,\" the solicitor general said.",
      "Cook's lawyers called the allegations against her \"flimsy\" and \"unproven\" and argued in papers that the Fed's independence and removal restriction prohibit her firing. They said that allegations of private, pre-office conduct do not constitute \"cause\" for removal under the law. Cook joined the Fed Board in May 2022, and the allegations involve mortgage agreements from 2021.",
      "Cook also did not receive the notice and opportunity to be heard that she is due under federal law and the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, they said. Her lawyers warned that accepting Mr. Trump's argument that removals from the Fed Board are not subject to judicial scrutiny would \"eviscerate\" Congress' choice to protect the central bank's independence.",
      "\"Congress did not mean for the nation's monetary policy to turn on that game of find-an-alleged crime,\" they said.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently expressed frustration with the Fed and Powell over decisions regarding interest rates. He has denounced the chair as \"incompetent\" or \"crooked.\"",
      "Powell and Cook have separately suggested that the accusations leveled against them are pretextual, and indicated Mr. Trump is targeting them for disagreements over monetary policy.",

Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post from Davos, Switzerland, following a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "In an interview with CNBC shortly after his post, the president said \"we have a concept of a deal\" and that he thinks it will be \"a very good deal for the United States, also for them.\"",
      "\"We're going to work together on something having to do with the Arctic as a whole, but also Greenland. And it has to do with the security, great security, strong security, and other things,\" he said.",

      "\"It's the kind of a deal that I wanted to be able to make,\" Mr. Trump told CNBC.",
      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan that that there is no agreement for U.S. control or ownership of Greenland. The framework of the deal, according to the sources, would ramp up security for Greenland beyond the existing 1951 U.S. agreement, which allowed the U.S. to establish several military bases on the island, although the only one that is still operating is Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base. It would also increase NATO's role with the specific intent of blocking Russia and China from gaining a foothold in Greenland, the sources said. But such a deal would still need to be directly negotiated with Denmark and Greenland.",
      "U.S. ownership of the territory is still a red line for Denmark and Greenland, the sources said.",
      "NATO was similarly tight-lipped about details of the arrangement. In a statement, Allison Hart, a spokesperson for the alliance, said Mr. Trump and Rutte's meeting was \"very productive\" and that they \"discussed the critical significance of security in the Arctic region to all Allies, including the United States.\"",
      "\"Discussions among NATO Allies on the framework the President referenced will focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts of Allies, especially the seven Arctic Allies,\" Hart said. \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold \u2014 economically or militarily \u2014 in Greenland.\"",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, also issued a statement, saying the day \"is ending on a better note than it began.\"",
      "\"We welcome that President Trump has ruled out to take Greenland by force and paused the trade war with Europe. Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" it said.",
      "The president addressed the annual meeting of global leaders at the World Economic Forum earlier in the day and reiterated his insistence that the U.S. needs to own the semi-autonomous Danish territory for security reasons. But, for the first time, he ruled out the use of military force to take control of the island, and said he was instead \"seeking immediate negotiations\" over the territory.",
      "Over the weekend, the president threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that opposed his Greenland push beginning next month, and said the tariff would increase to 25% if the U.S. did not acquire the island. The threat of a trade war with longstanding allies sent shockwaves through European capitals, with leaders scrambling to address the threat and defend Greenland and Denmark's autonomy before gathering in Davos.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that owning Greenland is critical for completing his \"Golden Dome\" missile defense shield, and that NATO should back his acquisition of the territory to defend against Russia and China. In his Truth Social post, he said that discussions over the missile shield will continue.",

      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all.

      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland.

And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",

      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop all pending cases targeting the sale of illicit \"defeat devices\" in diesel-powered vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Wednesday ordered federal prosecutors to stop pursuing criminal charges and drop all pending cases targeting the sale of illicit \"defeat devices\" that are used to tamper with air pollution control systems in diesel-powered vehicles, according to a memo seen by CBS News.",
      "The edict, issued by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, marks the first time that the Justice Department has formally taken steps to scale back environmental criminal enforcement since President Trump took office in January 2025.",
      "In the memo, Blanche wrote that he was taking this step \"to ensure consistent and fair prosecution under the law, as well as to ensure the best use of Department resources,\" according to a copy reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Although the Trump administration took drastic steps throughout 2025 to roll back environmental rules targeting greenhouse gas emissions, many of those actions focused on regulations or civil enforcement, as opposed to criminal environmental enforcement.",
      "In justifying the decision, Blanche cited a new and untested legal theory that runs counter to conclusions reached by both career federal prosecutors and attorneys for the Environmental Protection Agency, according to internal government records reviewed by CBS and multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The theory posits that the violations could not be prosecuted as crimes under the Clean Air Act, and could only be pursued as civil offenses.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson, when asked for comment on the memo, pointed to a social media post made late Wednesday afternoon. It said the department was \"exercising its enforcement discretion to no longer pursue\" criminal charges of the Clean Air Act based on allegations of tampering with the software associated with emissions control devices.",
      "Blanche's memo comes several months after Mr. Trump in November pardoned Troy Lake, a Wyoming-based diesel mechanic who served seven months in federal prison for conspiring to violate the Clean Air Act by disabling emissions-control devices inside diesel trucks.",
      "The pardon came at the urging of Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who alleged that the Lake case represented an example of a \"weaponized\" prosecution by the Biden administration. She did not cite any evidence for her claim.",
      "Lummis has also championed legislation that would strip the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate air pollution rules for vehicle emissions and ban the federal government from forcing auto manufacturers to install emissions control systems.",
      "Blanche's order could potentially impact more than a dozen pending criminal cases across the country targeting companies and individuals who allegedly sold after-market emissions defeat devices, as well as more than 20 ongoing investigations, according to two sources familiar with the matter and court filings.",
      "Several of the pending criminal cases, including two in different districts in Pennsylvania, were indicted in 2025 during the first year of Mr. Trump's second term in office, court filings show.",
      "The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate air pollution levels generated by vehicles.",
      "In order to comply with those rules, auto manufacturers are required to install emissions control systems to reduce the level of pollutants, such as including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.",
      "It is unlawful to tamper with those systems, but there's a robust black market for after-market emissions defeat devices because deleting or tuning them can help boost horsepower and improve mileage.",
      "Historically, the EPA and the Justice Department have focused on defeat devices used in diesel vehicles because of the greater pollutant levels they cause.",
      "A 2020 study by the EPA found that in the last decade, emissions controls had been removed from some 550,000 diesel pickup trucks, leading to the emission of 570,000 tons of excess oxides of nitrogen.",
      "The Justice Department's most high-profile Clean Air Act criminal case related to emissions cheating was Volkswagen.",
      "In 2017, at the tail end of the Obama administration, the company pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it sought to deceive the EPA and state regulators in California by installing defeat devices into its emissions control systems in a failed attempt to cheat emissions tests.",
      "As part of the plea, Volkswagen paid a $2.8 billion criminal fine, and also agreed to pay another $1.5 billion in separate civil resolutions.",
      "After Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his first term, the EPA decided to start scrutinizing after-market emissions defeat devices and went on to make it an investigative priority.",
      "Untested defense bar arguments",
      "The push to kill all of the pending defeat device cases was championed by Adam Gustafson, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division who previously worked for Boeing and at the EPA, according to two of those sources and government records seen by CBS News.",
      "He has not specialized in the practice of criminal environmental law.",
      "Although Gustafson has previously signed off on at least some of the pending indictments involving after-market defeat devices, a new and novel defense bar argument that surfaced over the summer later changed his mind, the sources said.",
      "In July, an autobody shop owner named Tracy Coiteux appealed her criminal conviction under the Clean Air Act for tampering with emissions control systems before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Her attorneys put forth a legal theory alleging that she cannot be held criminally liable because the software associated with emission controls, known as \"onboard diagnostic systems,\" is not \"required to be maintained\" under the Clean Air Act.",
      "For this reason, they claimed that such an offense can only be charged as a civil violation, not a criminal one.",
      "Andy Mergen, a longtime former appellate lawyer in the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said Blanche's memo to prosecutors is \"essentially a confession of error,\" which complicates matters in the Ninth Circuit litigation because it means the department is now deciding that it was wrong to bring a case on which it ultimately prevailed at trial.",
      "\"Confession of error is an important responsibility of the Justice Department, and the process is intended to be rigorous. The decision is understood to be in the domain of the solicitor general,\" he told CBS.",
      "Making such a determination, he said, entails carefully weighing a variety of factors, including the reasonableness of the position, and the credibility of the U.S. government.",
      "\"Environmental crimes are challenging and deserve attention, but the process used here makes me question whether the rigorous standards that govern a confession of error were applied here,\" Mergen said.",
      "Lawyers for John and Josh Owens, a father and son who own a diesel truck products business in Washington state, have since raised similar arguments in an effort to get the charges against their clients dismissed.",
      "\"This is the right decision: the Clean Air Act was never intended to be used in this way to impose criminal liability,\" said Bill McSwain of Duane Morris. These prosecutions targeting hardworking American tradesmen were wrongheaded from the start. Our clients are pleased to put this misguided, weaponized case behind them.\" McSwain, who is counsel to Josh Owens and Diesel Truck Products, previously served as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "An internal EPA memo reviewed by CBS News shows that career attorneys disagree with the arguments made by defense lawyers in the 9th Circuit case. The memo argues that there are \"multiple respects\" in which diesel truck emissions software systems are \"required to be maintained\" under the law, and therefore tampering with them can be a crime.",
      "\"When Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, legislators sought to ensure that regulated motor vehicles/engines would meet applicable emission standards not only at the time of manufacture and initial sale, but thereafter in everyday use,\" the memo says.",
      "Although the 9th Circuit has not yet ruled on the matter, the legal theory resonated with Gustafson, who started raising questions about the pending cases, one of the sources said.",
      "After Lake was pardoned in November, the topic picked up steam and Gustafson began reaching out to prosecutors with pending cases and asked them to justify the criminal charges, two of the sources said.",
      "Because some of the pending cases are being handled by other U.S. attorney's offices and not by the office that Gustafson leads, he could not order all of the cases to be dismissed on his own.",
      "He sought support from Blanche's office, and also from the EPA's incoming head of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Jeffrey Hall, whom the Senate confirmed on Dec. 18, three sources said.",
      "Shortly before Blanche issued his memo, Hall told staff that he had \"carefully examined EPA enforcement for tampering with onboard diagnostic units\" and that after speaking with the Justice Department, he was directing EPA to \"no longer investigate or pursue criminal cases\" related to the tampering of emissions control software.",

    "story": [
      "A newly disclosed whistleblower complaint indicates that Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorized its officers to enter homes without judicial warrants in the cases of people with deportation orders, a sweeping reversal of longstanding rules.",
      "Historically, ICE has told its officers that they could not rely on administrative immigration warrants \u2014 signed by officials at the agency, not judges \u2014 to enter people's homes, due to constitutional protections against warrantless searches.",
      "But a May 2025 memo disclosed Wednesday by two U.S. government whistleblowers gave ICE officers permission to use those administrative immigration warrants to enter residences by force to arrest unauthorized immigrants who had been ordered deported by an immigration judge or court.",
      "The directive, signed by Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, \"Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.\"",
      "Lyons' memo empowered ICE officers to use the \"necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien's residence\" if the targets of operations do not allow them inside.",
      "Before any forced entry, ICE officers should knock on the residence's door and identify themselves. The memo also directed officers to conduct such operations targeting those with deportation orders after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m.",
      "Asked about the previously undisclosed directive, which was reported by The Associated Press earlier Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said those affected by the memo had been given \"full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,\" McLaughlin argued in her statement. \"For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.\"",
      "The directive is likely to trigger legal challenges, as the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been long interpreted to largely prohibit searches and seizures without judicial warrants, including in the immigration context.",
      "According to the whistleblower complaint, which was shared with Congress, Lyons' memo has not been shared widely within the agency but has been used to train ICE officers.",
      "\"The whistleblowers assert that this is a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment,\" said Whistleblower Aid, the non-profit representing the whistleblowers. \"This disclosure is particularly timely and relevant given recent news reports of ICE officers breaking into homes, including those of U.S. citizens, without a judicial warrant and forcibly removing the residents.\"",

      "Here's a closer look at several of those claims.",
      "Trump's claim that Denmark has no legal right to Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a text exchange with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re on Jan. 19: \u00a0\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Details:\u00a0In the text exchange with St\u00f8re, Mr. Trump questioned Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland, writing there are \"no written documents\" establishing ownership.",

An international court also ruled in 1933 that Denmark held valid sovereignty over the entire island.",
      "Danish explorers and settlers began colonizing Greenland in the early 1700s, at a time when the U.S. was still a British colony.",
      "\"Danish expeditions reached and settled Greenland centuries ago,\" Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told CBS News in an email. \"Since then, Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland has been internationally recognized, including by the U.S., just as similar claims are recognized for many other nations around the world.\"",
      "Trump's claim that Russian and Chinese ships surround Greenland",
      "Trump said in a press gaggle\u00a0on Jan. 4: \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\" (Press gaggle, January 4)",
      "Mr. Trump said at a Jan. 9 press conference: \"We need that because if you take a look outside of Greenland right now, there are Russian destroyers. There are Chinese destroyers and bigger. There are Russian submarines all over the place. We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland, and that's what they're going to do if we don't.\"",
      "Details: Trump has also repeatedly claimed that a large number of Russian and Chinese ships are currently operating near Greenland.",

      "Greenland's minister of business Naaja Nathanielsen said she was \"not aware\" of any Russian and Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland when asked about Mr.Trump's comments\u00a0 earlier this month.",
      "Public ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic does not show any Russian- or Chinese-flagged commercial vessels around Greenland, with most traffic consisting of fishing boats. While vessels can turn off their transponders or spoof their locations, experts say there is no indication of the large-scale naval presence Mr. Trump has described.",

      "Details: \u00a0In jest or not, that is incorrect. While Danish special forces do operate the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol \u2014 a special force which patrols remote, icy areas using sled dogs \u2014 that is just one part of its military presence.",
      "Denmark deploys Arctic patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft, and maintains a military base in Nuuk with about 150 personnel, according to the Danish Ministry of Defense.",
      "Danish officials have also committed roughly $6.5 billion to modernize military capabilities in Greenland over the next decade, Chuffart said.",
      "As for the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, the 12-person team uses dog sleds because it is \"the most adequate mode of transportation in the region,\" \u00a0according to Chuffart.",
      "The U.S. already operates an air base in Greenland and has the option to expand its presence under a 1951 agreement with Denmark. Danish officials have said they would welcome greater U.S. cooperation on security \u2014 but insist Greenland is not for sale.",

      "The Pentagon is asking military attorneys to travel to Minnesota on assignment to the U.S. Attorney's Office, CBS News has learned, after the Justice Department called for more resources to be surged to the state.",
      "The Justice Department is also in talks with the Pentagon to send some of its forensic auditors to Minnesota to assist with fraud investigations and potentially to testify in court, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The Pentagon request for attorneys seen by CBS News describes the short-term volunteer assignment, which would begin in March, as a detail to serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in the state. It does not specify the focus of the assignment or required subject matter experience. A U.S. official told CBS News the Justice Department has asked the Pentagon for additional attorneys.",
      "The call for resources comes as the Justice Department is continuing and expanding its investigation into COVID-era welfare fraud in Minnesota. Nearly all of the defendants accused or convicted of defrauding a federal program to feed hungry children are of Somali descent. The Trump administration often refers to it as \"Somali-fraud.\"",
      "The city of Minneapolis is also the center of the largest deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in its history, who are there both for the fraud probe and to carry out immigration enforcement as part of what the Trump administration has dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge.\"",
      "The effort has the support of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the source added.",
      "Last week, Minneapolis' top fraud prosecutor and several others resigned, in part over concern that the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was not being probed as a civil rights case, and due to pressure to investigate Good's widow. The FBI is not currently investigating the agent who shot Good and prosecutors in the department's Civil Rights Division were previously ordered not to get involved.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:34:55 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",
      "The banking industry has opposed the cap, saying it would limit consumers' access to credit and steer them toward riskier lending products.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The standoff with Bill and Hillary Clinton escalated after they refused to appear in person before the committee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday recommended holding former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt after the pair refused to appear before the Republican-led panel, which is investigating the Justice Department's handling of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"The committee does not take this action lightly,\" Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the committee's chairman, said ahead of the vote. \"But subpoenas are not mere suggestions. They carry the force of law, and require compliance. Former President Clinton and Secretary Clinton were legally required to appear for depositions before this committee. They refused.\"",
      "Several Democrats voted with Republicans to recommend holding them in criminal contempt of Congress, advancing the issue to the full House for a vote on whether to find them in contempt and refer the matter to the Justice Department. Nine Democrats voted to advance the resolution related to Bill Clinton, while three Democrats supported the Hillary Clinton measure.",
      "Comer said he believed the full House would vote on the resolutions in two weeks.",
      "\"I expect a lot of Democrats to vote on this on the floor,\" Comer said.",
      "On Tuesday, House Oversight Republicans said the Clintons' attorneys \"made an untenable offer\" for the GOP chairman and top Democrat on the committee to travel to New York to speak with Bill Clinton. The proposal allowed each lawmaker to bring two staff members and the meeting would not be transcribed, according to the committee. Comer rejected the offer.",
      "A Clinton spokesperson denied the transcript stipulation, saying \"interviews are on the record and under oath.\"",
      "The committee subpoenaed the Clintons in August, along with former Justice Department officials dating back to George W. Bush's administration. Since then, only Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during President Trump's first term, has provided closed-door testimony to the committee, while the panel has accepted written statements from the others.",
      "Comer said the committee accepted statements from other former officials because they weren't photographed with Epstein or Maxwell, \"nor is there any evidence that they were directly involved in the investigation.\"",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump should also be subpoenaed, Comer said the president has already answered a lot of questions from the media.",
      "\"There's never been a sitting president come under oath in an Oversight Committee hearing,\" Comer said when it was noted that answers to questions from journalists aren't under oath. \"There's nothing that I've seen that implicates President Trump.\"",
      "Photos of Bill Clinton have appeared in the Epstein-related materials released by the Justice Department, along with references to the current president, though neither have been accused of wrongdoing. Comer cited a \"documented relationship\" between the Clintons and Epstein on Wednesday, which he said was \"evidenced by numerous photographs, flight-log records, wedding invitations and other materials.\"",
      "In letters to the committee last week explaining their decision not to appear, the Clintons and their legal team accused Comer of trying to embarrass and punish Mr. Trump's political rivals. Their lawyers vowed to fight the subpoenas, calling them \"invalid and legally unenforceable\" because they did not have a valid legislative purpose.",
      "The Clintons submitted sworn declarations to the committee last week describing their interactions with Epstein.",
      "In his declaration, Bill Clinton said Epstein offered his private plane to the former president, his staff and his Secret Service detail in support of the Clinton Foundation's philanthropic work between 2002 and 2003. He denied ever visiting Epstein's private island in the Virgin Islands, where a number of the late financier's alleged crimes occurred, and maintained that he had not been in contact with Epstein for more than a decade before his 2019 arrest.",
      "Hillary Clinton, in her declaration, said she did not recall encountering Epstein or any specific interactions with him. She also said she never flew on his plane or visited his private island.",
      "The Clintons also did not recall when they met convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell or their interactions with her, but said she later was in a relationship with a mutual friend of theirs. They did not remember exactly when their last interaction with Maxwell was beyond \"many years ago.\"",
      "\"To be clear, I had no idea of Mr. Epstein's or Ms. Maxwell's criminal activities,\" their declarations said.",
      "\"And, irrespective of any intent either may have ever had, I did not take any action for the purpose of helping them to avoid any type of scrutiny,\" Bill Clinton's declaration added.",
      "Asked by Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw of Virginia whether a demand that questions go beyond the scope of the Epstein investigation is a sticking point between the committee and the Clintons, Comer said everything pertains to the Epstein files. When Walkinshaw followed up, asking if he would be willing to limit the conversation to the Epstein issue, Comer agreed.",
      "\"I think the Clintons' lawyers have been under a different impression,\" Walkinshaw said.",
      "\"The Clinton lawyers are full of crap,\" Comer replied.",
      "Jonathan Shaub, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, said both Clintons have strong arguments for why they should not be compelled to testify, and the potential decision to prosecute puts the Justice Department in a tricky position that could have ramifications for Mr. Trump and officials in his administration if Democrats have control of Congress and the executive branch.",
      "\"There are some past Justice Department opinions that suggest, particularly with President Clinton, that a former president is immune from compelled congressional testimony,\" Shaub, who worked in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration, told CBS News.",
      "That argument would not apply to Hillary Clinton, though the committee would have to establish that it has a specific legislative interest in having her testify, Shaub said.",
      "\"That's a harder argument to make given what exists in the public record,\" Shaub said, referring to Hillary Clinton's absence in the Epstein files that have been made public. \"She would have stronger arguments in the prosecution to say that they don't have a legislative interest here.\"",
      "In Tuesday's statement, Comer said the committee is seeking testimony from Hillary Clinton \"given her knowledge from her time as Secretary of State of the federal government's work to counter international sex-[trafficking] rings, her personal knowledge of Ms. Maxwell, and her family's relationship with Mr. Epstein.\"",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said Democrats also want the former president to answer questions.",
      "\"Two things can be true. It can be true that we want to hear from the Clintons and that it's important that we hear from them and that we want to enforce our subpoena,\" Garcia said. \"I think it can also be true that they have also begun clearly making efforts to answer questions by declaration, to negotiate coming in to give testimony.\"",
      "The California Democrat noted that Bill Clinton has called for the immediate and full release of the Epstein files, while criticizing the Justice Department's release so far.",
      "\"Donald Trump is leading a White House cover-up right now of the Epstein files,\" Garcia said. \"And it is shameful, illegal and unconstitutional that the Department of Justice has released 1% of the files. Where is the pressure to get [Attorney General] Pam Bondi to release the files?\"",
      "Comer said Bondi, who is set to testify before another House committee next month, and the Justice Department is producing the documents and complying with the law compelling it to do so, though he acknowledged \"the pace is slower than any of us would prefer \u2014 and must speed up.\"",
      "Comer also announced that the committee has scheduled a Feb. 9 deposition with Maxwell. He said that he's been told by her lawyers that she plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment.",

    "story": [
      "Federal agents this week launched a new immigration enforcement operation in Maine, the latest front of the Trump administration's widening mass deportation campaign, Department of Homeland Security officials said Wednesday.",
      "The Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Maine started Tuesday, DHS officials said, noting that deportation officers had detained individuals from Angola, Ethiopia, Guatemala and Sudan with criminal histories. Officials at the agency said they had dubbed the effort \"Operation Catch of the Day.\"",
      "A DHS official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told CBS News that Somali immigrants are among those being targeted by ICE as part of the operation.",
      "There's an established community of immigrants from Somalia in parts of Maine, including Lewiston, the state's second largest city. Refugees and immigrants from other African countries, including the Republic of the Congo, have also settled in Maine in recent years, though its population remains overwhelmingly White.",
      "Immigrants from Somalia have been a frequent target of President Trump, who often describes them in harsh and derogatory ways. To partially justify its massive immigration crackdown in the Minneapolis area, the Trump administration has cited a fraud scandal in Minnesota implicating members of the state's Somali community.",
      "\"We're cracking down on more than $19 billion in fraud that was stolen by Somalian bandits. Can you believe that Somalians turned out to be higher IQ than we thought?\" Mr. Trump said during a speech in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. \"We said, these are low IQ people. How do they go into Minnesota and steal all that money?\"",
      "In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration launched the operation in Maine to target people in the U.S. illegally who have also committed crimes. She accused Democratic state leaders, including Gov. Janet Mills, of not cooperating with federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The operation has already sparked criticism from local leaders. David Morse, the mayor of the Portland suburb of Westbrook, said ICE had conducted arrests in his community on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "\"At least one peaceful US citizen observer from Westbrook was targeted for intimidation by a masked federal law enforcement officer this morning,\" Morse wrote in a social media post. \"This is outrageous behavior from a federal authority, and I stand by our citizens' rights to peacefully observe and/or protest.\"",
      "The ICE operation appears to have been telegraphed earlier in the week by the U.S. attorney in Maine, Andrew Benson.",
      "\"In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,\" Benson said on Monday.\u00a0 \"Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Scrutiny of ICE's operations and tactics has escalated in recent weeks following the deployment of thousands of immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, where local leaders and residents have accused federal agents of stopping U.S. citizens and acting too aggressively when conducting arrests. Protests there intensified after an ICE officer shot and killed Minnesota mother Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, on Jan. 7.",

    "summary": "The \"Board of Peace\" was first announced as part of the peace plan for Gaza. President Trump has recently suggested that its work could extend more broadly.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed \"Board of Peace\" is expected to be a focus of world leaders in Davos this week as questions linger over its composition and scope months after it was announced as part of the administration's peace plan for Gaza.",
      "The White House released new details about the board's leadership last week, and the president has recently suggested that its work could extend beyond Gaza.",
      "Now, the board's formation is facing headwinds from U.S. allies, as nations consider joining \u2014 or rejecting \u2014 the body.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to make an announcement on Thursday about a Board of Peace charter, according to his schedule in Davos. The White House had not officially released any information as of Wednesday about the charter or its contents.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "When was the Board of Peace created and why?",
      "The Board of Peace was first announced in September as a key component of the Trump administration's 20-point plan for long-term peace in Gaza and the broader Middle East. It was described in that plan as \"a new international transitional body\" that would \"set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program \u2026 and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza.\"",
      "\"This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment,\" it said.",
      "The White House said in a statement last week that the Board of Peace will play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the peace plan, \"providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.\"",
      "Who is leading the Board of Peace and overseeing it?",
      "The Board of Peace is chaired by President Trump, who can hold that position until he resigns from it, according to a U.S. official.",
      "According to the White House, the Board of Peace has an appointed \"founding Executive Board\" comprised of:",

      "Who is invited to the Board of Peace?",
      "CBS News confirmed that more than 50 countries have been invited to join as of Wednesday, Jan. 21.",
      "Among them is Russia, despite its continued assault on Ukraine and the Trump administration's statement that the country poses such a threat to national security that the U.S. must acquire Greenland to counter it.",
      "Mr. Trump said\u00a0he has sent an invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Belarus, which has provided material support to Russia during its invasion of Ukraine, was also invited and its president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, accepted.",
      "It isn't clear what criteria the White House is using to decide which countries are being invited to join.",
      "Who has joined the Board of Peace and who has declined?",
      "As many as 25 countries have signed on to join the Board of Peace, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said. But so far only a handful have said so publicly.",
      "\"I think we have north of 20, maybe 25 world leaders who have already accepted,\" Witkoff said in an interview in Davos with CNBC on Wednesday.",
      "Israel, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Morocco, Hungary, Qatar and Canada are among the nations that have announced they're accepting Mr. Trump's invitation.",
      "Other countries are considering their invitations.",
      "In a joint statement, officials from Qatar, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the UAE and Saudi Arabia said they welcomed the invitations to join the body.",
      "Norway and Sweden said Wednesday they're holding off, at least for now, due to concerns about the terms for joining.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News earlier this week that France intended to decline due to concerns that the Board of Peace charter goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises major issues, particularly regarding respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said Monday night he would impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne if they did not join the Board of Peace. The White House has not responded to several inquiries as to whether or not the president was joking.",
      "A French official said they have taken note of Mr. Trump's statements and called the use of tariff threats to influence France's foreign policy unacceptable and ineffective.",
      "Is the Board of Peace intended to replace the United Nations?",
      "President Trump said the Board of Peace \"might\" replace the United Nations.",
      "\"I mean, the U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I'm a big fan of the U.N. potential. But it has never lived up to its potential,\" he said in a more than 90-minute press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Jan. 20.",
      "But he added, \"I believe you've got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great.\"",
      "The following day, CNBC's Sara Eisen noted to Witkoff in an interview that \"some people say it's a U.N. alternative.\"",
      "\"No, no, it's just, it's a great group of leaders coming together with great opinion and sharing opinion to achieve peace, and that's what we need,\" Witkoff responded. \"Sometimes I say that my title should be the Secretary of Miscommunication, and the President is doing that. He's cleaning up miscommunication out there. He's bringing people together so that we can solve conflict.\"",
      "In November, the United Nations passed a Security Council resolution that approved a \"Board of Peace,\" but with a focus limited only to Gaza.",
      "The resolution welcomed the establishment of a Board of Peace \"as a transitional administration with international legal personality\" that would set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. resolution more broadly endorsed the Trump administration's 20-point Gaza peace plan, and authorized countries working with the Board of Peace to establish a stabilization force inside the Palestinian territory.",
      "Is a financial contribution required to join?",
      "A U.S. official confirmed a Bloomberg report that countries can contribute $1 billion to the Board of Peace to become permanent members instead of having a three-year membership. The official also said it isn't a requirement to contribute to become a member.",
      "The official told CBS News that any contributions will be used to rebuild Gaza and said \"virtually every dollar\" raised will be spent on the Board's mandate. There will be no \"exorbitant salaries\" or \"administrative bloat,\" the official said.",
      "When it comes to financial disbursements and cash management, the board \"will implement the highest financial controls and oversight mechanisms,\" and funds will sit only in approved accounts at reputable banks, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Emma  Nicholson and \n                                                  \n                                  Camilla  Schick\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Former television sports reporter Michele Tafoya is jumping into the U.S. Senate in Minnesota as a Republican. She submitted federal filings Tuesday afternoon and released a campaign video\u00a0announcing her candidacy Wednesday morning.",
      "Tafoya is seeking the open seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, as Republicans target a pickup opportunity in a state the GOP has not won statewide since 2006, when then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty was reelected. A Republican has not been elected to the U.S. Senate from Minnesota since Norm Coleman in 2002.",
      "\"I think Minnesota is in a crisis,\" Tafoya told CBS Minnesota station WCCO in an exclusive interview. \"I think we have a crisis in leadership and I think the career politicians that got us here are not going to get us out.\"",
      "\"In terms of policy, we've got a middle-class crisis,\" Tafoya said. \"We've got families struggling to pay rent, to pay mortgages, to put groceries on the table. Energy costs need to come down. Schools need to do better.\"",
      "Asked whether she supports President Trump's economic policies despite those struggles, Tafoya pointed to the lowering of gas prices and recent reports of rising GDP.",
      "\"It's only been a year, so let's see what happens here early 2026.\"",
      "CBS News can confirm Tafoya met last week with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to Republican sources familiar with the meeting. The Senate GOP's campaign arm has been recruiting Tafoya since Smith announced she would not seek reelection, as Republicans look to defend their current 53\u201347 majority in the upper chamber during this year's midterm elections. Tafoya's meeting with the NRSC was first reported by Fox News.",
      "Tafoya is entering a packed Republican primary that features former NBA player Royce White, the party's unsuccessful Senate nominee in 2024, along with former Minnesota GOP chair David Hann, U.S. Navy veteran Tom Weiler, and former Navy SEAL Adam Schwarze.",
      "On the Democratic side, a competitive primary is also taking shape between progressive Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and centrist Democratic Rep. Angie Craig. In a recent\u00a0interview with Newsweek, Craig said she believes Congress should impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem following the shooting death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in south Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month.",
      "Thousands of federal agents remain in the Twin Cities as part of a broader crackdown on immigration and an\u00a0escalating rhetorical and judicial fight between the Trump administration and local officials like Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",
      "\"What I wouldn't do is stir up this hatred for law enforcement,\" Tafoya asserted. \"No one has worked to calm the issue and say, 'Everyone let's take a breath. Everybody settle down. If you want to peacefully protest, that's OK.' What I've seen is the governor and the mayor stir people up and create this environment where they feel they should throw their cars and their bodies between law enforcement and their mission. That's not how you'll get peace and normalcy here.\"",
      "In total, roughly 3,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents have been dispatched to the Twin Cities, a force that is nearly five times the size of the Minneapolis police department, which employs about 600 officers.",
      "Tafoya told WCCO, \"I want public safety and I back law enforcement. So I would really like it if Minnesota's law enforcement could work with federal law enforcement to make this as safe and as peaceful for everyone. That keeps the officers safe and that keeps the public safe.\"",
      "Tafoya spent about a decade as a sideline reporter for NBC Sports' \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" before ending her tenure in 2021. She also had stints during her long sports broadcasting career with ABC Sports, ESPN and CBS Sports. In 2022, she served as co-chair for Kendall Qualls, a Republican gubernatorial candidate who is running again in this year's governor's race.",

    "story": [
      "The move by the board to add President Trump's name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has triggered a series of legal and legislative challenges. At least one federal lawsuit and two congressional measures seek to strip Trump's name from the exterior signs and website of the historic theater complex.",
      "In a federal civil lawsuit, Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves as one of the Kennedy Center's trustees, is asking a court to rule that her fellow Kennedy Center board members violated the law in December 2025, in voting to add Mr. Trump's name to the center.",
      "The suit also seeks a judge's order to \"declare that the name of Kennedy Center is 'The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts' and declare that the vote to change the Kennedy Center's name is null and void, and without legal effect.\"",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News the Trump administration is expected to formally respond to Beatty's lawsuit by the end of February.",
      "In her suit, Beatty noted that soon after President Kennedy was assassinated, Congress designated the yet-to-be-built Kennedy Center \"as the sole national memorial to the late President within the nation's capital.\"",
      "\"Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center's name requires an act of Congress,\" Beatty's lawsuit said. \"But on Dec. 18 and 19, 2025 \u2014 in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic \u2014 the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order.\"",
      "The decision by the new board to rename the Kennedy Center, part of an overhaul of the facility by Mr. Trump, was denounced by his critics. The president ousted a group of Kennedy Center board members in February and installed close allies as replacements.",
      "Comprising largely Trump loyalists, the board elected Mr. Trump as chairman in February. Longtime Trump ally Richard Grenell was named interim president and executive director of the Kennedy Center.",
      "The cost of the changes to the signage, website and other Kennedy Center monikers is unknown. In response to questions from CBS News about the pricetag, a Kennedy Center spokeswoman issued a statement saying, \"President Trump deserves credit for saving America's cultural center after years of neglect \u2014 as the very legislators attacking him now sat idly by while the center fell into disrepair.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who is among those challenging the name change in the lawsuit, told CBS News, \"The damages have been substantial, and that will be addressed in the case. They include far more, of course, than the high cost of signage and of the other naming changes. The losses to the performing corps, to the audience base, to the bottom line of the Center, to its memorial and other activities and indeed to the arts and arts education themselves have been vast.\"",
      "Aside from Rep. Beatty, other Congressional Democrats are also attempting to remove Mr. Trump's name from the Kennedy Center.",
      "In the House, Democratic members have introduced two bills to intervene.",
      "Rep. April McClain Delaney, a first-term Democrat from the Washington, D.C., suburbs in Maryland, has introduced a bill to \"require the removal of any signage or other identification from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that differs from the designation 'John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"",
      "McClain Delaney told CBS News, \"A president can't enshrine himself. This is what authoritarian leaders do,\" adding that \"it's arrogant and it's narcissistic.\"",
      "In a separate House resolution, Rep. Stephen Lynch, a longtime Massachusetts congressman who serves on the House Oversight Committee, is seeking a formal statement from the House that the renaming of Kennedy Center violates federal law.",
      "In a December floor speech, Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, blasted the effort by Trump allies, calling it \"a sacrilege to a martyred, heroic, historic American president whose name was attached to the Kennedy Center for his support for cultural excellence in America and because he was an assassinated president who we all mourned.\"",
      "\"The idea that Donald Trump would want his name to go before Kennedy's \u2014 or even with Kennedy's \u2014 is a sacrilege,\" Cohen said. \"It should not be changed ever, and it should go through this Congress, who named it the Kennedy Center, on a bill in this House and signed by President Lyndon Johnson.\"",

    "summary": "After returning to Joint Base Andrews, President Trump departed for Davos about one hour later aboard a second aircraft.",
    "story": [
      "A \"minor electrical issue\" forced Air Force One to turn around and return to Maryland less than an hour after takeoff Tuesday night as it was headed for Davos, Switzerland, with President Trump aboard, White House officials said. The president then departed for Switzerland aboard a new plane about an hour later.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters aboard the plane that, after takeoff from Joint Base Andrews, the crew identified a \"minor electrical issue,\" and, out of an abundance of caution, chose to turn around and return to the base.",
      "Air Force One landed back at the base at 11:07 p.m. Eastern Time.",
      "Reporters had said that the lights in the press cabin briefly went out after takeoff, but no explanation was offered.",
      "The president then boarded a new aircraft, which took off shortly after midnight. The second aircraft is an Air Force C-32, a modified Boeing 757 normally used by the president for domestic trips to smaller airports, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump is headed to Davos for the World Economic Forum. He was scheduled to address the forum at about 8:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, shortly after landing.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who's already in Davos, said Mr. Trump would be about three hours late.",
      "\"This will be an interesting trip,\" the president told reporters on the White House lawn shortly before departing for Joint Base Andrews. \"I have no idea what is going to happen. But you are well represented.\"",
      "There are currently two modified Boeing 747s that serve as Air Force One. Both have been in service since 1990. They were set to be replaced in 2024 with modified Boeing 747s, but the completion of the first replacement plane was delayed until 2027, and the second delayed to 2028, according to the U.S. Air Force.",
      "Last summer, Mr. Trump\u00a0confirmed that the Qatari royal family\u00a0had donated a Boeing 747-8 jumbo\u00a0aircraft valued at $400 million to the president to eventually be used as Air Force One. However, renovating the plane could cost several hundred million dollars before it could be ready for use, Air Force Secretary Troy Meink said last June.",

      "According to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Sagitta is a Panamanian-flagged vessel and is owned by Sunne Co Limited, which also owns several other U.S.-sanctioned vessels. It was allegedly part of a shadow fleet of vessels that transport oil from sanctioned nations such as Iran, Russia and Venezuela, the Treasury Department said.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:44:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for Reza Valizadeh, a U.S. citizen arrested in 2024 by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, filed a petition Tuesday with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.",
    "story": [
      "When Abdolreza \"Reza\" Valizadeh returned to Iran in the spring of 2024, it was the first time he had set foot in his home country in 15 years. The veteran journalist, who had spent more than a decade in exile, traveled to Iran to see and care for his aging parents.",
      "Six months later, he was in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.",
      "Valizadeh, a 49-year-old dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and longtime critic of Iran's security establishment, was arrested on Sept. 22, 2024, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His detention, detailed in a petition filed Tuesday by his attorney with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, comes amid Iran's sweeping crackdown on protests across the country, and as tensions with Washington simmer.",
      "The State Department formally designated Valizadeh as \"wrongfully detained\" in May 2025, placing his case under the authority of the U.S. government's hostage affairs office. Valizadeh is one of at least four Iranian-Americans currently held in Iran, including 70-year-old Kamran Hekmati and at least one other septuagenarian, a woman, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"In lodging this petition to the UN, alongside pulling every lever of power available to us in D.C., we are committed to bringing attention to Reza's case, not only to secure his release, but to send an unequivocal message that the targeting of U.S. citizens abroad will not be tolerated,\" Ryan Fayhee, counsel to Valizadeh and a partner at the law firm Akin Gump, said in a statement.",
      "\"Every day that Reza remains behind bars, the Iranian regime is emboldened to target Americans who dare to advocate for truth, justice, and a better future for the Iranian people,\" Fayhee said.",
      "Valizadeh's case continues to unfold against a volatile backdrop inside Iran, where thousands of protesters\u00a0are believed to have been killed, and many thousands more arrested, as authorities have cracked down on recent demonstrations over economic hardship and political repression. A near-total internet and communications blackout has been in place for more than two weeks.",
      "U.S. officials have condemned Tehran's treatment of protesters, warning of further economic pressure \u2014 and possible military strikes \u2014 while leaving open the possibility of talks. Iranian leaders have accused Washington of interference, raising concerns among rights advocates that Americans held in Iran could be used as leverage as tensions sharpen.",
      "President Trump said last week he held off on striking Iran after being assured by the regime that the executions of hundreds of protesters had been \"canceled,\" but in a recent interview called for \"new leadership\" in Iran. The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group has begun to move west from the Indo-Pacific towards the Middle East, CBS News has confirmed, and is expected to arrive in the coming days.",
      "\"The Trump administration is closely monitoring Mr. Valizadeh's case. President Trump has been clear that he wants every wrongfully detained American returned home,\" a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The State Department and a spokesperson for the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "\"These Americans must come home\"",
      "Valizadeh became a U.S. citizen in 2022 through his work for U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Farda, the Persian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "According to messages relayed to his attorney by his family, Valizadeh believed he had been given assurances by Iranian authorities that it was safe to return to Tehran, where most of his family resides. His brother has said he now believes those guarantees were part of a trap, possibly involving a former colleague who had ties to the IRGC.",
      "Reporting by Persian-language media later cited sources who said Iranian intelligence had hoped to pressure Valizadeh into cooperating against his former employer, Radio Farda, for which he reported on corruption, protests and the influence of the IRGC. He refused.",
      "Days later, IRGC agents detained him on a Tehran street, confiscated his belongings, including his U.S. passport, and took him to Evin Prison, where he spent weeks in isolation and under intense interrogation. Iranian officials did not publicly acknowledge his arrest for nearly two months.",
      "Valizadeh was eventually charged with \"collaborating with a hostile government,\" a vague national security offense that Iranian authorities routinely use against journalists and activists.",
      "In December 2024, after what the petition to the U.N. describes as a sham trial lasting less than an hour, and in which the judge acted as both prosecutor and adjudicator, Valizadeh was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His appeal to the regime was rejected in January 2025.",
      "Since then, his family says Valizadeh's health has steadily deteriorated. He suffers from asthma, which has been worsened by overcrowded cells, poor air quality and exposure to smoke and debris \u2014 conditions that intensified after Israeli airstrikes struck parts of Evin Prison in June 2025 during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He has endured frequent coughing fits and has been denied basic medications, dental care and treatment for gastrointestinal problems.",
      "After the June strikes, Valizadeh was among prisoners who were shackled and transferred to another facility without their belongings or medicine, according to the U.N. filing, before being returned to Evin Prison, where his brother says he now shares a small cell with up to 18 other inmates amid severe shortages of food, water, sanitation and medical care.",
      "Attorneys for other American citizens who were wrongfully detained have petitioned the U.N. for help in the recent past. They included\u00a0Baquer Namazi, who was permitted to leave Iran for life-saving surgery in the UAE in 2022, and Ryan Corbett, who was imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan and released in a prisoners swap in January 2025.",
      "\"Family is at the heart of the Iranian culture. This is why so many Iranian Americans travel back to Iran \u2014 to visit elderly parents and connect with extended family. Unfortunately, this respect for family is also what gives the regime a steady influx of dual nationals to feast on,\" Neda Sharghi, the sister of former wrongful detainee Emad Shargi and an advocate for American hostages and their families, told CBS News. (The siblings use slightly different spellings of their last name.)",
      "\"President Trump has witnessed the brutality of the Iranian regime. He also knows that we have innocent Americans, like recently detained Reza Valizadeh and Kamran Hekmati, among others, ensnared in the regime's hostage-taking tentacles. These Americans must come home and President Trump and his team have shown us that, at least when it comes to American hostages and wrongful detainees, they will do whatever they need to attain their freedom,\" Sharghi said.",
      "With help from Sharghi and Valizadeh's family, Fayhee has received since September three pre-recorded voice messages from Valizadeh describing the circumstances of his detention. The last came on Dec. 20.",
      "Neither Valizadeh nor his family have been in contact since Iran's crackdown and nationwide internet blackout began.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "In this landmark year for American democracy, historian Lindsay Chervinsky, Washington Post columnist George F. Will, and Atlantic staff writer Vivian Salama talk about what the second year of Trump's presidency may mean for America's future.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump took office a year ago, the news has never let up. Just consider recent weeks: An attack in Venezuela; talk of acquiring Greenland (via what Mr. Trump described as \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\"); a criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair; and the fatal shooting of an American woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration agent.",
      "Now, as we enter the second year of the second Trump presidency, we also enter the 250th year of our republic. Time to take a deep breath \u2013 and take stock.",
      "Historian Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon, says that right now, America is at a turning point. \"Most republics in history don't last 300 years, and it's because it's a really hard thing to do,\" she said. \"It's a nation that is based on an idea rather than a shared ethnic or religious background. And that means it's going to be messy.\"",
      "\"I alone can fix this\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put himself at the center not only of the American presidency, but the American system. One of his most famous quotes is \"I alone can fix this.\"",
      "\"I think the American system was never designed to be based on one person; that's really what the Revolution is all about,\" Chervinsky said. \"The best administrations that we have seen \u2013 I would put Washington at the top of that list, Lincoln, FDR, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 they understood that they were better if they had Congress on their side, if they were working together to pass legislation, to make decisions that would stand the test of time, because they had the buy-in of the American people through their representatives.\"",
      "To date, President Trump has had almost total \"buy-in\" from the Republican-controlled Congress. It passed his signature legislation last year, what he called his \"big beautiful bill\" of spending and tax cuts.",
      "Chervinsky said, \"From the very beginning, Congress was always envisioned as the vital force of the government. It was the body that was going to put forth legislation. It was going to pass a budget. It established the rules for any sort of military force. It could declare war. It was supposed to be the most powerful branch, which is why it's first.\"",
      "The bounds of executive power",
      "Recently, Mr. Trump told reporters that his \"morality\" is \"the only thing that can stop\" him. When asked whether the president is testing the bounds of executive power, Washington Post columnist George Will replied, \"President Trump is denying that there are bounds of executive power.\"",
      "Will, a conservative who has chronicled Washington dynamics for more than 50 years, has had sharp criticism for President Trump and his use of power. Indeed, many Republicans on Capitol Hill privately agree with Will, but are publicly silent.",
      "Asked why, Will replied, \"Fear. It's really simple. Of 435 members of the House, there are perhaps 35 competitive districts, which means that an incumbent Republican only has to fear a primary from the right \u2013 being primaried. And they all feel they are one hostile Trump tweet away from a primary challenge.\"",
      "But would incumbents even want to stay in the job these days? Will noted, \"We have this really unfortunate dynamic that the very sort of people you want to stay are leaving. You want them to stay 'cause they take the job seriously. They're leaving because they say it's not a serious job anymore.\"",
      "Asked to comment on the Trump administration's use of federal forces in American cities and towns, Will said, \"Other presidencies haven't done this. Surely when Detroit had horrible riots in the '60s, and Watts and all the rest, troops were sent in, National Guard. But no president has done what this one has done. These young men and women come in [as] ICE dressed for combat on Iwo Jima.",
      "\"But the masks? Why are they wearing masks?\" Will asked. \"What are they hiding, and from whom, and why?",
      "When Mr. Trump first came to power in 2017, he seemed almost unfamiliar with where the levers of power were in the federal government. This time around is different. \"I think he has adjusted to the presidency,\" Will said. \"And I also think (unlike in 2017), in the first year of the second Trump term, we realized that he had people around him now who understood the nuts and bolts of government. [And] they have pushed things.\"",
      "\"President to the world, not just to Americans\"",
      "That push is evident on the foreign front, where the president has pursued an aggressive policy that has been cheered by domestic allies \u2013 and rattled allies abroad.",
      "\"He came in this time really keen to be president to the world, not just to Americans,\" said Vivian Salama, who covers foreign affairs for The Atlantic. \"He's coming to it with what his supporters call 'masculine' foreign policy.\"",
      "Seven years ago, Salama and her colleagues at the Wall Street Journal revealed President Trump had designs on Greenland. \"I thought it was a joke,\" she said. \"It certainly is not a joke now. And in fact, we know that there are serious policy discussions happening at the State Department and the White House and elsewhere in the government, where the wheels are very much in motion to try to figure out how best to make this happen.\"",
      "Even with Venezuela, China, Taiwan, Iran, the Middle East and other global tensions, Salama says the most vexing issue for President Trump in the world is the Ukraine-Russia war, still hovering over him. \"Remember, on the campaign trail, he promised to solve it before he even took office. He said it would take 24 hours,\" she said. \"It is a little harder than that. Governing is hard. Governing is actually hard. And then diplomacy is even harder, and especially when you're dealing with someone like Vladimir Putin, who was a shrewd KGB agent and knows how to manipulate his adversaries. And this is what President Trump is realizing. He says, This is a hard one and I thought it was gonna be easy, but it's hard.\"",
      "Another hard one: this year's midterm elections. The economy will be issue #1, and who controls Congress could determine the future of the Trump presidency \u2013 and the president remains at the center of it all, leaving us all wondering what comes next.",
      "Chervinsky says we are living through a historic time: \"I personally like writing about historic times; I think I'd be okay living in a boring moment for a little while!\" she said. \"Those living through the Revolution or the Civil War understood that they were living through a historic moment. I think that is true of this moment. We can feel that history is being made. We're just not exactly sure what future generations are gonna say about us.\"",

      "The National Park Service said that parking lot construction was underway in September near the Quarry Exhibit Hall in the Utah side of the park when the dinosaur fossils were uncovered. Dinosaur National Monument is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, about 300 miles west of Denver.",
      "A portion of dinosaur-bearing sandstone was exposed when asphalt was removed on Sept. 16 by workers. Construction was immediately paused to allow paleontologists to assess and excavate the fossils.",
      "\"The fossils belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur, most like Diplodocus, which is common in this bonebed,\" the NPS said in a statement.",
      "Approximately 3,000 pounds of fossils and rock were removed during the excavation between mid-September and mid-October, the NPS said. The fossils are being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.",
      "According to NPS, the bonebed area had not been excavated for fossils since the original excavations at the site ended in 1924. Meanwhile, the parking lot and road improvement construction project was completed once the excavation was done.",
      "Research released last October suggests that dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before an asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago.",
      "In January 2025, a nearly\u00a070-million-year-old dinosaur fossil was discovered during a parking lot project at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. It is the oldest dinosaur fossil ever found within Denver's city limits.",

    "summary": "Four Artemis II astronauts plan to fly around the moon and back next month, traveling farther from Earth than any humans before them.",
    "story": [
      "After months of meticulous preparation, NASA's 32-story-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, was hauled to its seaside launch pad Saturday in Florida, setting the stage for a long-awaited flight next month to send four astronauts on a trip around the moon.",
      "The 5.7-million-pound rocket, carried by an upgraded Apollo-era crawler-transporter tipping the scales at some six million pounds, began the trip to pad 39B just after 7 a.m. local time, creeping out of NASA's cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at a top speed of just under 1 mile per hour.",
      "Hundreds of space center workers, family members and guests gathered near the VAB and along the crawlerway to take in the sight, posing for selfies and enjoying a chilly Saturday morning as the towering moon rocket slowly rolled past.",
      "New NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and the Artemis II astronauts \u2014 Cmdr. Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen \u2014 were also on hand to witness the milestone.",
      "\"Wow. LETS GO!!!\" Wiseman posted on the social media platform X with a photo of the SLS rocket moving out of the VAB. In another post, he called the SLS and its Orion crew capsule \"engineering art.\"",
      "Wow. LETS GO!!! pic.twitter.com/xozFfnJI8c",
      "Generating some 8.8 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, the SLS is the most powerful rocket ever operated by NASA, including the agency's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. It has a little more than half the thrust of SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but after a successful unpiloted test flight in 2022 \u2014 Artemis I \u2014 NASA deemed it safe enough to put astronauts aboard.",
      "The SpaceX rocket is still in the test phase, and it's not known when it might make its first flight with people on board.",
      "The Artemis II crew plans to blast off in early February to test drive their Orion crew capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space on a flight around the moon that will carry them farther from Earth than any astronauts have ever ventured. In the process, they will get a chance to observe the far side of the moon in some detail.",
      "\"I think one of the most magical things for me in this experience is when I looked out a few mornings ago, there was a beautiful crescent (moon) in the morning sunrise, and I truly just see the far side,\" Wiseman told reporters during the SLS rollout. \"It was a waning crescent here, so it's a waxing gibbous on the far side.\"",
      "He added: \"And you just think about all the landmarks we've been studying on that far side, and how amazing that will look, and seeing Earth rise, those sorts of things, just flipping the moon over and seeing it from the other perspective is what I think when I look out (at the moon) right now.\"",
      "The trip to launch pad 39B took about eight hours, kicking off a busy few weeks of tightly scripted tests and checkouts before a critical fueling test around Feb. 2 when nearly 800,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen will be pumped aboard for a \"wet\" dress rehearsal countdown.",
      "\"One of the first things that happens after we get to the pad, we get  connected ... all the validations, getting tied back to the firing  room, getting ready to power up the individual elements,\" said launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"We will get into our crew module  work (and) we're going to power everything up.\"",
      "Blackwell-Thompson added: \"We have  incrementally tested all of this offline or in the integrated  environment of the VAB and now it's just getting out to the pad and  testing those pad interfaces. ... Wet dress is the big test at the pad.  That's the one to keep an eye on, I guess, that's the driver to launch.\"",
      "The maiden flight of the SLS rocket in 2022 was delayed multiple times by propellant loading problems and persistent hydrogen leaks. For the rocket's second flight, NASA and its contractor team have implemented multiple upgrades and procedural changes to minimize or eliminate any such problems the second time around.",
      "\"Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,\" said Blackwell-Thompson. \"And the things that we learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.\"",
      "Because of the relative positions of the Earth and moon, along with the trajectory NASA plans to use for Artemis II, the agency only has five launch opportunities in February: Feb. 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Because rollout came a few days later than planned, pushing the fueling test into early February, it would appear only the final three opportunities are still available.",
      "But a leak-free fueling test, in the absence of any other major issues, will clear the way for a launch attempt on one or two of those days. If not, the next set of launch windows opens in March.",
      "A wild card in the mission planning is the launch of a fresh crew to the International Space Station to replace four crew members who returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue affecting one of the astronauts. That launch originally was scheduled for Feb. 15, but NASA managers are looking into moving it up by several days to minimize the gap between crews.",
      "NASA flight controllers want to avoid flying two piloted spacecraft at the same time. If the space station crew replacement flight stays on track, or if problems are found during the SLS fueling test, agency managers might be forced to delay the Artemis II launch to the next set of opportunities in March.",
      "But Isaacman is keeping NASA's options open.",
      "\"We have, I think, zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress,\" he said. \"But look, that's our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared. We'll take it.\"",

    "story": [
      "With a space station medical evacuation safely completed, NASA is focused on two challenging missions proceeding in parallel: launching four astronauts on a flight around the moon, at the same time as the agency is planning to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station.",
      "Engineers plan to haul the Artemis 2 moon rocket to launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday for tests leading to launch early next month on a historic piloted flight around the moon.",
      "At the same time, NASA is gearing up to launch four Crew 12 astronauts to the space station, possibly while the Artemis 2 moon mission is underway, to replace four Crew 11 crew members who cut their mission short and returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue.",
      "The Artemis 2 mission and Crew 12's planned space station flight present a unique challenge for NASA. The agency has not managed two piloted spacecraft at the same time since a pair of two-man Gemini capsules tested rendezvous procedures in low-Earth orbit in 1965. The agency has never flown a deep space mission amid another launch to Earth orbit.",
      "\"This is exactly what we should be doing at NASA,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's new administrator, said Thursday. \"We have the means as an agency ... to be able to bring our astronauts home at any time ... while making preparations to pull forward our next mission, like Crew 12, while also progressing on our Artemis 2 campaign.\"",
      "He described the moon mission as \"probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half century.\"",
      "The world's most powerful rocket booster",
      "NASA's towering 322-foot-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, will be hauled out of the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building early Saturday atop an upgraded Apollo-era crawler transporter. Including at least one stop along the way, the 4-mile move to the pad is expected to take eight to 10 hours.",
      "\"It takes us a little while to get out of the building,\" said Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"But about an hour after we get that first motion, you'll begin to see that beautiful vehicle cross over the threshold of the VAB and come outside for the world to have a look.\"",
      "Once at the pad, engineers will carry out a variety of tests and work to ready the rocket and its Orion crew capsule for blastoff early next month on the Artemis 2 moon mission.",
      "\"It really doesn't get much better than this,\" John Honeycutt, chairman of the Artemis 2 Mission Management Team, told reporters Friday. \"We're making history.\"",
      "Commander Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen planned to be on hand for the rollout. If all goes well, the crew will test the Orion capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space, flying farther from home than any other humans as they loop around the far side of the moon.",
      "Artemis 2 mission plan",
      "The Artemis 2 mission follows a similar flight in 2022 that sent an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon to pave the way for next month's flight. The Artemis 2 mission, in turn, will set the stage for Artemis 3, a long-awaited and oft-delayed mission to land astronauts near the moon's south pole. The current target date for Artemis 3 is 2028.",
      "Despite Saturday's planned rollout, the Artemis 2 launch date is still uncertain.",
      "It will depend in large part on the results of a fueling test around the first of the month when engineers plan to load the booster's 21-story-tall first stage with 733,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen along with a full load of propellants for the booster's 45-foot-tall second stage, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS.",
      "During tests of the SLS rocket used for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, multiple fueling tests had to be carried out before engineers finally resolved a series of propellant leaks. The SLS rolling out on Saturday features multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize or eliminate any such leakage.",
      "If the upcoming fueling test goes well, Wiseman and his crewmates could be cleared to blast off a few days before Feb. 11, the end of next month's launch period. If any major problems are found during the propellant loading exercise, Artemis 2 likely will slip to early March when the next set of launch windows becomes available.",
      "Next space station crew",
      "Amid the work to ready the Artemis 2 rocket for launch, NASA managers are also working to move up the launch of the Crew 12 space station crew. Commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch on Feb. 15.",
      "The crew they are replacing, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 after helping familiarize their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation.",
      "But Crew 11 was ordered to cut their mission short after one of the crew members developed a medical issue of some sort. They returned to Earth Thursday, leaving just three people aboard the space station: cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched to the outpost in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch date to minimize the gap between the two NASA missions. Depending on where it ends up, NASA could be orchestrating a launch to the International Space Station while the Artemis 2 crew is flying around the moon.",
      "\"I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue along those parallel paths,\" Isaacman said. \"And if it comes down to a point in time where we have to de-conflict between two human spaceflight missions, that is a very good problem to have at NASA.\"",
      "Jeff Radigan, lead flight director for Artemis 2, agreed it made sense to continue preparing for both missions.",
      "\"I know the agency is preparing to launch Crew 12,\" he told reporters. \"There are a lot of preparations going on, but there absolutely are constraints.\"",
      "\"It's not prudent for us to put both of those up at the same time, but we also have to ensure that both of them are ready to go. We may run into an issue, and the last thing we want to do is make a decision too early and then lose an opportunity. That would not be responsible of us.",
      "\"So, we need to keep pressing with both missions, we need to ensure that we're doing that at the right speed, and we're looking at the right technical constraints. As we get closer, either the decision will come about because the hardware's talking to us and we have an issue that we have to go deal with, or we have to pick one.\"",
      "But, he added, \"that doesn't mean we should stop preparing for either mission right now, but we need to do that at the right pace.\"",

      "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window \"when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.",
      "In one example shared by the AI company, a user asks for authentic Mexican dish recommendations. ChatGPT responds with ideas for carne asada and pollo al carbon dishes and then links to a grocery brand advertising hot sauce.",
      "Only adults who use the free version of ChatGPT, or ChatGPT Go, a new low-cost subscription plan OpenAI announced Friday, will be shown ads. Higher-tier subscriptions, including Pro, which now costs $200 a month, will not include ads, OpenAI said.",
      "Asked how long the ad testing phase will last, and whether it has plans to scale the use of ads, an OpenAI spokesperson told CBS News, \"We will look at early user feedback and quality signals to see if early testing meets our bar before expanding.\"",

      "A federal appeals court on Wednesday temporarily paused a judge's ruling that\u00a0restricted the use of force federal agents can use on peaceful protesters in Minneapolis.",
      "The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay of the preliminary injunction, filed last week, while the federal government pursues an appeal.",
      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez in a\u00a083-page order\u00a0blocked federal agents who are deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration's immigration operations from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters. The order also barred them from arresting peaceful protesters.",
      "It also barred federal law enforcement from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is \"no reasonable articulable suspicion\" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.",
      "The ruling, now suspended, was in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of six community members, alleging federal agents violated their constitutional rights.",
      "One of the suit's plaintiffs, Susan Tincher, said she went to observe ICE activity in her Minneapolis neighborhood on Dec. 9, and within 15 seconds of her arrival, she was \"on the ground in handcuffs.\"",
      "Tincher said she was taken to a facility where she was \"put in shackles\" and \"held for five hours\" before being released.",

      "\"This judge put the safety of the public and federal law enforcement at risk barring them from using crowd control measures when rioters became violent and threaten the safety of the public and officers,\" McLaughlin said. \"This ruling is a win for the safety of the public and every law enforcement officer. DHS does not use force against peaceful protesters or stop cars without reasonable suspicion of a crime.\"",
      "Menendez's ruling followed a weekslong uptick in immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis.

    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "story": [
      "In the hours before his game, on a mild February night in 2024 inside the on-campus Corbett sports center in Greensboro, North Carolina, Camian Shell allegedly sent a heart emoji in response to a text message he'd just received. By the end of the game, Shell's North Carolina A&T men's basketball team would suffer a huge halftime deficit and an eventual 84-58 defeat.",
      "Shell's heart emoji is now evidence in one of the largest and most sweeping federal investigations into alleged point shaving in college sports.",
      "Shell, who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last week in Philadelphia federal court, is one of more than a dozen college athletes accused of accepting bribes from gamblers to take a dive and deliberately tank their performance on the court.",
      "According to charging documents, a co-conspirator texted Shell a request to shave points before one February 2024 game. Prosecutors alleged Shell sent the emoji in response to the text and \"underperformed in and influenced the first half as they had agreed.\"",
      "The conspiracy allegedly corrupted nearly 30 NCAA basketball games in 2024 and 2025.",
      "The case comes just months after two Major League Baseball pitchers were charged with allegedly rigging individual pitches, in an alleged conspiracy with gamblers. In recent months, an NBA player has also been charged by federal prosecutors with conspiring with gamblers to underperform on the court, to help bettors secure victorious wagers.",
      "This series of high-profile cases \u2014 which follow a rapid nationwide expansion of legal sports gambling \u2014 has triggered calls for the leagues to create and empower an internal investigative agency to police for illicit gambling schemes and misconduct by players and other employees.",
      "One proposal, released by former federal corruption prosecutor Carolyn Pokorny, recommends an \"inspector general for sports integrity,\" which is funded by the leagues but operates independently.",
      "\"When your reputation and your business model are at stake, you just can't investigate yourself credibly. You need someone with independence to do it,\" Pokorny told CBS News.",
      "Pokorny said the recent criminal sports gambling investigations by the Justice Department have exposed vulnerabilities in the major sports leagues and risk damaging the sports' brands.",
      "Pokorny, who previously oversaw sports gaming cases in the Eastern District of New York, said the Justice Department has only limited bandwidth to root out unlawful gaming in sports.",
      "Pokorny told CBS News, \"Those kinds of prosecutions are really critical. But you have to keep in mind that prosecutors are stretched very thin, and they have a huge mandate. They're handling terrorism, drug cartels and human trafficking. They are not the sports integrity police.\"",
      "In a December op-ed for Bloomberg Law, Pokorny pointed to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private oversight body funded by Wall Street firms, as a \"working model for how this could be done.\" Pokorny said the leagues could work in collaboration to have a single inspector general monitoring for suspicious wagers, patterns or actions. She said any individual league could also do so on its own.",
      "She compared the proposed inspector general to government inspectors general offices, which have full-time attorneys and auditing specialists who conduct audits, inspections and investigations to root out waste, fraud and abuse. They also monitor for misconduct and vulnerabilities to fraud and criminal misconduct.",
      "In response to a request for comment on Pokorny's proposal, the NCAA pointed to its\u00a0existing enforcement efforts, which it described as \"one of the largest integrity monitoring programs in the world.\" The collegiate sports organization also noted that it has called for an end to \"prop bets,\" or wagers on things other than a game's final outcome, including the performance of individual players. The NCAA said prop bets pose \"integrity risks.\"",
      "The NFL and MLB declined to comment to CBS News. The NBA and NHL did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Justice Department's NCAA basketball gambling investigation required nearly two years to fully uncover, spanning 26 criminal defendants. Most of the games that were allegedly impacted took place in early 2024. Prosecutors said the bribes could range between $10,000 and $30,000 per game. The people behind the alleged scheme are accused of finding games in which a corrupted player was on a team that was favored to lose and then bribing the player to deliberately underperform during the game and not cover the point spread.",
      "Games involving the following teams were allegedly rigged or impacted, investigators say: North Carolina A&T, Towson, Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Butler, DePaul, Duquesne, East Carolina, Florida Atlantic, Fordham, Georgetown, Kennesaw State, Kent State, La Salle, McNeese State, Nicholls State, Ohio University, St. Louis University, St. John's, SUNY Buffalo, Tulane and Western Michigan University.",
      "An attorney for Shell would not comment when reached by CBS News.",
      "In response to the case, NCAA President Charlie Baker issued a statement which, in part, said the revelations were \"not entirely new information to the NCAA.\"",
      "\"Through helpful collaboration and with industry regulators, we have finished or have open investigations into almost all of the teams in today's indictment,\" Baker said at the time.",
      "An internal investigation by the NBA also led the league to ban Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter in April 2024 for allegedly giving information about his health status to gamblers. Porter pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy later that year.",
      "Pokorny told CBS News that internal investigations by the professional leagues and NCAA are helpful but not sufficient to root out the spread of gambling schemes.",
      "\"It's private industry. They can do what they want,\" she said, referring to the idea of appointing an independent inspector general. \"I think they can do this today, and the business case for doing it [in] sports betting is: It's a multi-billion dollar industry to protect.\"",
      "Sports business reporter John Ourand, who covers the leagues, media and industry for digital news outlet Puck, said there is still little, if any, indication the sports gambling cases have hurt the bottom lines of pro sports leagues or NCAA \u2014 at least not yet.",

    "summary": "Paul Schnell, Minnesota's corrections commissioner, rejects DHS' claims that state authorities have been releasing hundreds of dangerous criminals, rather than turning them over to ICE.",
    "story": [
      "A top Minnesota law enforcement official is rejecting repeated accusations by the Department of Homeland Security that state authorities have been releasing hundreds of dangerous criminals into the streets, rather than turning them over to federal immigration agents.",
      "Paul Schnell, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, called the claims \"fundamentally false\" and warned that such federal messaging risks undermining public trust in both immigration enforcement and public safety.",
      "\"We cooperate with ICE and ICE detainers,\" Schnell told CBS News in an interview on Wednesday. \"We have, as a matter of policy, done that for a long, long time. How they can say otherwise is unbelievable.\"",
      "It came after Marcos Charles, ICE's acting executive associate director for Enforcement and Removal Operations on Tuesday accused Minnesota officials of failing to turn people over to federal custody \u2014 and claimed there were more than 1,360 pending ICE detainers statewide.",
      "Those are federal requests to local law enforcement to detain individuals for up to 48 hours after they're set to be released from criminal confinement \u2014 which gives ICE time to decide whether to take them into custody to begin deportation proceedings.",
      "\"The best solution is to turn them over to us in a safe, controlled setting like a jail or prison instead of releasing them back onto the streets,\" Charles said at a news conference in St. Paul, Tuesday, warning that releases put communities \"where your children go to school\" at risk.",
      "But the Department of Corrections commissioner said those coordinated turnovers are already happening \u2014 and have been for years, as a matter of policy and state law. Schnell said his department routinely communicates with ICE in the weeks before an incarcerated person's release to arrange handoffs if a detainer is in place. And according to Minnesota corrections data, 84 people were transferred directly from state prisons to ICE custody in 2025.",
      "To better understand the scope of the issue, Schnell said his department conducted a statewide survey. They found 207 individuals in state prisons and 94 in county jails are subject to ICE detainers \u2014 301 total. This is far short of the 1,360 cited by federal officials.",
      "\"We cannot explain how those numbers square,\" Schnell said. \"And nobody is sitting down with us to explain it.\"",
      "Schnell told CBS News his agency has repeatedly asked DHS to reconcile the discrepancy but has received no documentation showing missed transfers or failures to comply.",
      "\"If we made a mistake, we would own it,\" he said. \"But to date, no one has shown us where we failed.\"",
      "Asked for comment on Schnell's remarks, a DHS spokesperson reiterated the agency's assertions that hundreds of criminals have been released across Minnesota and that 1,360 people in custody statewide are subject to active ICE detainers.",
      "The spokesperson did not address the discrepancies raised by Schnell, but pointed to a list of six people with criminal charges or convictions that DHS says were released in Minnesota, and called on Gov. Tim Walz to \"commit to honoring all ICE detainers.\"",
      "In some cases, Schnell said, it is ICE that chooses not to detain individuals any longer, releasing them under federal supervision or into the community. He emphasized that this is a decision made by federal authorities, not the state.",
      "\"We didn't release them into the community,\" he said. \"We released them to ICE.\"",
      "Schnell also pushed back against the Department of Homeland Security's regular publication of so-called \"worst of the worst\" lists, which highlight individuals with serious criminal convictions ICE claims to have arrested. But Schnell insisted Minnesota corrections had coordinated with ICE to transfer custody of many of those people and called the lists \"propaganda, in many instances.\" He added that in multiple cases, federal authorities opt to release detainees after they're in ICE custody.",
      "\"These weren't people swept up on Minneapolis streets,\" he said. \"They were released to ICE. What happened after that was not our decision.\"",
      "Schnell acknowledged that compliance with civil ICE detainers varies at the county level \u2014 particularly in large jurisdictions like Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. But he also stressed that the Department of Corrections' authority is limited to the state prison system, not local jails.",
      "Despite the sharp disagreements, Schnell emphasized that day-to-day cooperation between Corrections Department staff and ICE officers on the ground remains strong.",
      "\"Staff to staff, operationally, this is working exactly the way it should,\" he said. \"Which is why I think their staff are probably equally confused.\"",
      "What he wants now, Schnell said, is a direct conversation at senior levels of DHS to reconcile data and messaging \u2014 not public accusations.",
      "\"It's in the best interest of public safety to get this right,\" he said. \"Rhetoric doesn't solve anything. Facts do.\"",
      "As immigration enforcement continues to be a flashpoint nationally and locally, the dispute underscores a deeper challenge: a fragmented system in which federal, state, and local entities operate under different authorities, with access to varying data systems \u2014 often speaking past one another in the process.",
      "\"We care deeply about public safety,\" Schnell said. \"That's why we follow this policy. And we will continue to coordinate the transfer of custody \u2014 period.\"",

    "summary": "Former Des Moines superintendent Ian Roberts is set to appear before a federal judge Thursday and is expected to plead guilty to charges of falsely claiming U.S. citizenship and illegally possessing firearms.",
    "story": [
      "The former superintendent of Iowa's largest school district is expected to plead guilty Thursday in federal court to charges that he falsely claimed to be a U.S. citizen and illegally possessed firearms, a plea agreement shows.",
      "Ian Roberts had a two-decade-long career as an educator and school administrator in districts across the U.S. before becoming superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, a district of 30,000 kids where he was beloved for his charismatic and exuberant leadership style.",
      "Just weeks into the school year, Roberts was arrested on Sep. 26 in a targeted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation that stunned community members and attracted national attention.",
      "He was placed on leave a day later in a unanimous vote by the Des Moines school board in a meeting that lasted just three minutes. Roberts resigned Sept. 30.",
      "School board president Jackie Norris said at the time, \"I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing. The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.\"",
      "A native of Guyana, in South America, Roberts initially pleaded not guilty to the two charges, which together carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Now Roberts is expected to plead guilty to both charges, according to a plea agreement signed by Roberts and released Wednesday.",
      "The plea agreement also indicates that Roberts is aware he could face deportation after he serves his sentence.",
      "Roberts was pulled over in his school-issued Jeep Cherokee and allegedly fled from federal agents, who found the car abandoned near a wooded area and located Roberts with the help of state troopers. Authorities said they found a loaded handgun wrapped in a towel under the seat and $3,000 in cash in the car.",
      "A federal grand jury in October returned a two-count indictment. According to the agreement, Roberts made a \"false attestation\" on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, that he submitted in Des Moines, claiming he was a U.S. citizen even though authorities say he knew he lacked authorization. That carries a punishment of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.",
      "Roberts completed the I-9 form when he was hired in 2023 and submitted a Social Security card and driver's license as verifying documents, according to the district. He also stated he was a U.S. citizen in his application to the state board of educational examiners, which issued Roberts a professional administrator license in 2023.",
      "Prior to his work in Des Moines, Roberts was a teacher and principal in several Baltimore schools in the early 2000s.",
      "Federal officials said Roberts first entered the U.S. in 1994 on a non-immigrant visa. They said he returned in 1999 on an F-1 student visa, which was set to expire in March 2004. He was denied a green card application in 2003, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.",
      "His next listed interaction with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was in 2018, when he ultimately obtained work authorization. Authorities said his second application for work authorization was approved, expiring in December 2020, and that he has not had work authorization since then.",
      "Roberts was subject to a notice to appear before an immigration judge in October 2020 and a final removal order in 2024, authorities said. District officials said they were not aware of the immigration issues.",
      "Alfredo Parrish, one of Roberts' attorneys, has said his client was under the impression from a prior attorney that his immigration case was \"resolved successfully.\"",
      "Parrish did not return phone and email messages Wednesday about the change-of-plea hearing.",
      "Roberts also faces a federal weapons charge, punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The indictment describes two pistols, a rifle and a shotgun found in Roberts' possession. In addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, three firearms were found during a search of Roberts' home, authorities said.",
      "Roberts will agree to forfeit the weapons, according to the agreement.",
      "CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI\u00a0reported at the time of Roberts' arrest that during a 2023 background check undertaken by a private contracter Roberts told the school board about a previous firearm charge related to a hunting rifle, and the district said he provided \"sufficient context and explanation\" to move forward.",
      "The hearing was scheduled after Roberts' lawyers said in a court filing that they had been negotiating with prosecutors to reach a resolution ahead of a Jan. 28 deadline. As part of Roberts' plea agreement, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Iowa agreed to not pursue additional charges against Roberts or others related to these counts. Prosecutors also agreed to recommend some leniency but Roberts' sentence is ultimately up to the judge.",
      "Roberts waived his right to be present at his arraignment in October, when he pleaded not guilty. A trial had been scheduled to begin in early March.",

      "\"They tell their kids lock the door behind us and don't open it and don't leave,\" the mayor said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-lisa-cook-fed-trump-oral-arguments/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:09:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last August. Courts have so far allowed her to continue serving in her role while litigation continues.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared likely to allow Lisa Cook to keep her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and reject\u00a0President Trump's attempt to fire her\u00a0for now.",
      "The high court heard arguments in a high-stakes case over Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook, which he attempted last August over allegations she engaged in mortgage fraud. Lower courts had allowed Cook to remain in her post while she pursued a legal challenge to her firing.",
      "The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gives the president the authority to remove a member of the Fed's Board of Governors \"for cause,\" though the law does not define the term. In informing Cook of her removal, Mr. Trump wrote in a letter shared to social media that he had \"sufficient cause\" to do so because of what he claimed was \"deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter.\"",
      "Cook has denied wrongdoing and has not been criminally charged. Mr. Trump's move to fire her was unprecedented. No other president has tried to oust a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year history.",
      "The Fed has an \"unbroken history going back to its founding in 1913 in which no president, from Woodrow Wilson to Joseph Biden has ever even tried to remove a governor for cause, despite the ever-present temptation for lower rates and easier money,\" Paul Clement, who argued on Cook's behalf, told the justices.",
      "Across the session, several members of the court expressed concern about damaging the independence of the Fed and questioned whether the allegations against Cook met the standard of \"cause\" laid out in the statute. They repeatedly focused on the posture of the case, which arrived at the Supreme Court in its early stages. Lower courts have not yet explored the facts of the dispute.",
      "Some of the justices also appeared open to Cook's argument that she was entitled to, and deprived of, notice and opportunity to respond to the allegations before she was removed. Mr. Trump had demanded on Truth Social that Cook resign and, five days later, shared the letter on social media announcing her firing.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said that Cook's firing was handled in a \"very cursory manner,\" while Justice Neil Gorsuch raised questions as to what procedures would provide her adequate due process.",
      "\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt Room where the president provides Ms. Cook \u2014 Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, give her the chance to defend herself,\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett said. \"It just wouldn't be that big of a deal, it seems, if that's enough.\"",
      "Oral arguments",
      "In defending Mr. Trump's effort to fire Cook, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that \"deceit or gross negligence\" by a financial regulator is cause for removal, and said the president has discretion to oust an officer for reasons related to her conduct, ability, fitness or competence. He argued that allowing Cook to remain in her position while her case proceeds would do \"grievous injury\" to the public's perceptions of the Fed.",
      "\"The American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who was, at best, grossly negligent in obtaining favorable interest rates for herself,\" he said.",
      "Several of the justices pressed Sauer about the consequences of a decision allowing Mr. Trump to fire Cook, and specifically the ramifications for the U.S. economy. Barrett pointed to predictions from economists that Cook's removal could trigger a recession.",
      "\"How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?\" she said, later adding that the risks to the economy may counsel caution by the Supreme Court.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh pushed Sauer on the implications of the administration's position in the case and how it would impact the Fed's independence.",
      "\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines \u2014 that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh said that if the Supreme Court accepts Mr. Trump's view, a Democratic successor could come in and fire all of his appointees, effectively turning the Fed's for-cause removal standard into at-will. Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, stressed that the court should think about the \"consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\"",
      "\"It incentives a president to come up with what, as the Federal Reserve former governors say, trivial or inconsequential or old allegations that are very difficult to disprove. It incentivizes kind of the search-and-destroy and find something and just put that on a piece of paper. No judicial review. No process, nothing, you're done,\" he said. \"What are we doing when we have a system that incentivizes that and leads to that?\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the circumstances surrounding Cook's firing-by-social-media \"irregular,\" adding that \"it certainly didn't invite an opportunity to be heard.\"",
      "Cook's case",
      "Cook sued over her removal last year, arguing that the president violated the Federal Reserve Act. She also said she was entitled to and deprived of notice and the opportunity to a hearing before she was fired.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook\u00a0and reinstated her to her post, finding that Mr. Trump had not validly removed her \"for cause.\" The judge also ruled that Cook was likely to succeed on her argument that she was deprived of her due-process rights because she did not receive the necessary process before her firing.",
      "A divided panel of three appeals court judges\u00a0continued to block Cook's removal, and the Trump administration sought emergency relief from Supreme Court and asked the justices to allow the president to oust her.",
      "The high court has\u00a0allowed Cook to remain\u00a0in her position while it considers whether Mr. Trump can fire her and is hearing the case on an expedited schedule. Cook has participated in the last two meetings of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee. Its next meeting is set for later this month.",
      "The dispute involving Cook's firing poses a test for the independence of the Fed, which defenders of the bank argue would be jeopardized if the Supreme Court rules for Mr. Trump. Arguments also come days after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell revealed the central bank received criminal subpoenas from the Justice Department stemming from a\u00a0criminal investigation\u00a0into him.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of other independent agencies and appears poised to overturn a 90-year-old decision that allowed Congress to impose removal protections for officials at multi-member boards and commissions. But it has also signaled that it views the Fed differently from those other entities.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court singled out the Fed as a \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\" Kavanaugh separately suggested in December that the court could create an exception for the central bank to the president's otherwise unrestricted power to remove certain executive officers.",
      "Unlike the case involving removal restrictions for independent agencies, the Justice Department is not challenging the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause protection. Instead, the key issues are whether Mr. Trump needed to give Cook notice and a hearing before removing her, if the president had cause to fire her \u2014 and what constitutes \"cause\" \u2014 and whether courts can review that decision.",
      "Sauer argued in Supreme Court filings that the president lawfully ousted Cook after \"concluding that the American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who made misrepresentations material to her mortgage rates that appear to have been grossly negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.\"",
      "Cook's alleged conduct \"created an intolerable appearance of impropriety in someone charged with the weightiest responsibilities in our financial system,\" he\u00a0wrote. \"There is a world of difference between that removal and removals grounded in policy disagreements.\"",
      "Sauer also told the justices in papers that courts cannot second-guess the president's determination that there was cause to fire Cook. But even if they could, Mr. Trump identified a valid reason for doing so: her \"apparent fraud or gross negligence in a financial matter,\" the solicitor general said.",
      "Cook's lawyers called the allegations against her \"flimsy\" and \"unproven\" and argued in papers that the Fed's independence and removal restriction prohibit her firing. They said that allegations of private, pre-office conduct do not constitute \"cause\" for removal under the law. Cook joined the Fed Board in May 2022, and the allegations involve mortgage agreements from 2021.",
      "Cook also did not receive the notice and opportunity to be heard that she is due under federal law and the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, they said. Her lawyers warned that accepting Mr. Trump's argument that removals from the Fed Board are not subject to judicial scrutiny would \"eviscerate\" Congress' choice to protect the central bank's independence.",
      "\"Congress did not mean for the nation's monetary policy to turn on that game of find-an-alleged crime,\" they said.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently expressed frustration with the Fed and Powell over decisions regarding interest rates. He has denounced the chair as \"incompetent\" or \"crooked.\"",
      "Powell and Cook have separately suggested that the accusations leveled against them are pretextual, and indicated Mr. Trump is targeting them for disagreements over monetary policy.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he will not be imposing tariffs against European countries over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said he will not be imposing tariffs against European countries over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland, revealing Wednesday that he and the secretary-general of NATO reached \"the framework of a future deal\" regarding the island.",
      "\"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post from Davos, Switzerland, following a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "In an interview with CNBC shortly after his post, the president said \"we have a concept of a deal\" and that he thinks it will be \"a very good deal for the United States, also for them.\"",
      "\"We're going to work together on something having to do with the Arctic as a whole, but also Greenland. And it has to do with the security, great security, strong security, and other things,\" he said.",
      "He declined to provide specifics of the framework, saying \"it's a little bit complex\" and that the U.S. will \"explain it down the line.\" He did note that the agreement would last \"forever.\"",
      "\"It's the kind of a deal that I wanted to be able to make,\" Mr. Trump told CNBC.",
      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan that that there is no agreement for U.S. control or ownership of Greenland. The framework of the deal, according to the sources, would ramp up security for Greenland beyond the existing 1951 U.S. agreement, which allowed the U.S. to establish several military bases on the island, although the only one that is still operating is Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base. It would also increase NATO's role with the specific intent of blocking Russia and China from gaining a foothold in Greenland, the sources said. But such a deal would still need to be directly negotiated with Denmark and Greenland.",
      "U.S. ownership of the territory is still a red line for Denmark and Greenland, the sources said.",
      "NATO was similarly tight-lipped about details of the arrangement. In a statement, Allison Hart, a spokesperson for the alliance, said Mr. Trump and Rutte's meeting was \"very productive\" and that they \"discussed the critical significance of security in the Arctic region to all Allies, including the United States.\"",
      "\"Discussions among NATO Allies on the framework the President referenced will focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts of Allies, especially the seven Arctic Allies,\" Hart said. \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold \u2014 economically or militarily \u2014 in Greenland.\"",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, also issued a statement, saying the day \"is ending on a better note than it began.\"",
      "\"We welcome that President Trump has ruled out to take Greenland by force and paused the trade war with Europe. Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" it said.",
      "The president addressed the annual meeting of global leaders at the World Economic Forum earlier in the day and reiterated his insistence that the U.S. needs to own the semi-autonomous Danish territory for security reasons. But, for the first time, he ruled out the use of military force to take control of the island, and said he was instead \"seeking immediate negotiations\" over the territory.",
      "Over the weekend, the president threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that opposed his Greenland push beginning next month, and said the tariff would increase to 25% if the U.S. did not acquire the island. The threat of a trade war with longstanding allies sent shockwaves through European capitals, with leaders scrambling to address the threat and defend Greenland and Denmark's autonomy before gathering in Davos.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that owning Greenland is critical for completing his \"Golden Dome\" missile defense shield, and that NATO should back his acquisition of the territory to defend against Russia and China. In his Truth Social post, he said that discussions over the missile shield will continue.",
      "\"Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland,\" he said. \"Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations \u2014 They will report directly to me.\"",

      "A significant winter storm event is shaping up to begin in the southern Plains on Friday and move across the South and into the East Coast over the upcoming weekend. Heavy snow, thick ice and brutal cold are expected to make the storm a potentially life-threatening weather event for nearly 30 states.",
      "Maps show what to expect from the winter storm",
      "A low-pressure system is forecast to develop in the Southwest and interact with incoming Gulf moisture and Arctic cold air to begin dropping precipitation on Friday in the southern Plains.",
      "The system is expected to slowly move eastward, bringing snow and accumulating ice. Forecast models continue to change as the event nears, but it is set to impact more than half of the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, the polar vortex that is usually situated over the North Pole is forecast to dip down into the eastern half of the U.S. starting Thursday and lasting through the first half of next week.",
      "This will make temperatures drop well below average for this time of year and even bring record-breaking temperatures to some locations. Frostbite can occur in as little as 5-10 minutes if exposed to this dangerous cold. Wind chill temperatures are forecast to feel like 40-50 degrees below zero in some places across the northern U.S.",
      "Ice is expected to accumulate along the southern side of the storm's track, but considering its slow movement, the amount of accumulation is expected to be between two-tenths of an inch to up to half an inch. Impacts of this magnitude can bring down power lines. With the harsh cold in place, power outages can lead to lack of indoor heating, crippling communities.",
      "Possible snowfall amounts are fluctuating as the forecast models continue to come together. Up to 5-10 inches of snowfall is already expected across the southern Plains as the system takes shape over the region on Friday into Saturday.",
      "As this system moves east, snowfall amounts will vary depending on location.",
      "Winter storm may impact travel plans",
      "Travel impacts are also possible on roadways and at the airports. Some airports in the South do not have deicing equipment for aircraft to take off safely, possibly leading to widespread cancellations and delays over the weekend.",
      "Some airports that could see issues are Dallas Fort Worth International Airport; Will Rogers International Airport in Oklahoma City; Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis International Airport and Nashville International Airport in Tennessee; and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.",
      "The roads could also become very difficult to navigate if not impossible with slick conditions on major interstates such as I-10, I-20, I-30, I-35, I-40, I-44, I-49 and I-55.",
      "Travel on the roads is highly discouraged through the weekend, but if it's absolutely necessary, people are advised to drive with caution. Officials urge drivers to consider taking a winter storm kit with them, including such items as booster cables, a flashlight, a shovel, blankets and extra clothing as well as water, a first aid kit and anything else that would help survive being stranded.",

    "summary": "Austin David Thompson, now 18, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and other charges for a mass shooting in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "An 18-year-old pleaded guilty Wednesday to murder and other charges for a mass shooting in North Carolina, acknowledging that he carried out a 2022 killing rampage that left five people dead, including his older brother and a police officer.",
      "Austin David Thompson, who was 15 at the time of the attack that authorities say began in his Raleigh neighborhood, had been poised to go on trial in state court in less than two weeks.",
      "Instead, Thompson's attorneys, who for months had filed pretrial motions designed to limit certain testimony and evidence, announced Tuesday that he planned to plead guilty to all charges against him. His attorneys wrote that avoiding a trial would \"save the community and the victims from as much additional infliction of trauma as possible.\"",
      "Thompson, wearing a quarter-zip sweater and slacks, offered few words while Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway questioned him and accepted his pleas. He pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of assault of an officer with a gun.",
      "Ridgeway set a sentencing hearing for Feb. 2, which could last several days as testimony and evidence are reviewed. Thompson and his attorney acknowledged in court that no plea agreement had been reached with local prosecutors.",
      "Because of his age at the time of the attack, Thompson cannot receive the death penalty. A judge can issue sentences of life in prison without parole on such murder counts. Ridgeway instead could sentence him in the case so he could be eligible for parole after at least 25 years. State appeals judges recently placed a 40-year limit on how long such young offenders must serve before becoming eligible for parole.",
      "Resolution in the case was delayed in part while Thompson recovered from a gunshot wound that Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman concluded earlier was self-inflicted before his arrest. His attorneys say it resulted in a serious brain injury.",
      "Providing the court a summary of evidence that would have been used at trial, Assistant District Attorney Patrick Latour described the sequence of events during the Oct. 13, 2022, shootings. He said Thompson first shot then repeatedly stabbed his brother James, whose body was found in the family's home in the Hedingham community.",
      "Latour said an armed Thompson next shot multiple neighbors on the community's streets, killing Nicole Connors, 52, and then off-duty Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29. Another neighbor who was wounded survived. Later, Thompson fatally shot two others on a nearby greenway trail: Mary Marshall, 34, and Susan Karnatz, 49.",
      "Dressed in camouflage with multiple weapons, Thompson was located by law enforcement in a shed nearby and arrested after an hourslong standoff during which he wounded another police officer, Latour said.",
      "Wednesday's hearing provided little additional explanation about Austin's motive. His attorneys wrote this week that the brain injury \"has made it such that Austin cannot explain why he committed this shooting.\"",
      "Latour said a note written by Thompson acknowledged why he killed his brother but didn't explain further. The note was ordered to remain confidential for now. Latour also said records showing Thompson's online search history revealed that he had sought information on mass shootings and related items.",
      "Robert Steele, Marshall's fiance at the time of her death, told reporters after the hearing that sentencing Thompson to life in prison without parole is the right thing to do.",
      "\"That's justice,\" Steele said. \"He took five people's lives, he tried to take two others.\"",
      "In 2024, Thompson's father pleaded guilty to improperly storing a handgun that authorities said was found with his son after the shootings. He received a suspended sentence and probation.",
      "Investigators seized 11 firearms and 160 boxes of ammunition \u2014 some of them empty \u2014 from the Thompson home, according to search warrants.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop all pending cases targeting the sale of illicit \"defeat devices\" in diesel-powered vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Wednesday ordered federal prosecutors to stop pursuing criminal charges and drop all pending cases targeting the sale of illicit \"defeat devices\" that are used to tamper with air pollution control systems in diesel-powered vehicles, according to a memo seen by CBS News.",
      "The edict, issued by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, marks the first time that the Justice Department has formally taken steps to scale back environmental criminal enforcement since President Trump took office in January 2025.",
      "In the memo, Blanche wrote that he was taking this step \"to ensure consistent and fair prosecution under the law, as well as to ensure the best use of Department resources,\" according to a copy reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Although the Trump administration took drastic steps throughout 2025 to roll back environmental rules targeting greenhouse gas emissions, many of those actions focused on regulations or civil enforcement, as opposed to criminal environmental enforcement.",
      "In justifying the decision, Blanche cited a new and untested legal theory that runs counter to conclusions reached by both career federal prosecutors and attorneys for the Environmental Protection Agency, according to internal government records reviewed by CBS and multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The theory posits that the violations could not be prosecuted as crimes under the Clean Air Act, and could only be pursued as civil offenses.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson, when asked for comment on the memo, pointed to a social media post made late Wednesday afternoon. It said the department was \"exercising its enforcement discretion to no longer pursue\" criminal charges of the Clean Air Act based on allegations of tampering with the software associated with emissions control devices.",
      "Blanche's memo comes several months after Mr. Trump in November pardoned Troy Lake, a Wyoming-based diesel mechanic who served seven months in federal prison for conspiring to violate the Clean Air Act by disabling emissions-control devices inside diesel trucks.",
      "The pardon came at the urging of Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who alleged that the Lake case represented an example of a \"weaponized\" prosecution by the Biden administration. She did not cite any evidence for her claim.",
      "Lummis has also championed legislation that would strip the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate air pollution rules for vehicle emissions and ban the federal government from forcing auto manufacturers to install emissions control systems.",
      "Blanche's order could potentially impact more than a dozen pending criminal cases across the country targeting companies and individuals who allegedly sold after-market emissions defeat devices, as well as more than 20 ongoing investigations, according to two sources familiar with the matter and court filings.",
      "Several of the pending criminal cases, including two in different districts in Pennsylvania, were indicted in 2025 during the first year of Mr. Trump's second term in office, court filings show.",
      "The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate air pollution levels generated by vehicles.",
      "In order to comply with those rules, auto manufacturers are required to install emissions control systems to reduce the level of pollutants, such as including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.",
      "It is unlawful to tamper with those systems, but there's a robust black market for after-market emissions defeat devices because deleting or tuning them can help boost horsepower and improve mileage.",
      "Historically, the EPA and the Justice Department have focused on defeat devices used in diesel vehicles because of the greater pollutant levels they cause.",
      "A 2020 study by the EPA found that in the last decade, emissions controls had been removed from some 550,000 diesel pickup trucks, leading to the emission of 570,000 tons of excess oxides of nitrogen.",
      "The Justice Department's most high-profile Clean Air Act criminal case related to emissions cheating was Volkswagen.",
      "In 2017, at the tail end of the Obama administration, the company pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it sought to deceive the EPA and state regulators in California by installing defeat devices into its emissions control systems in a failed attempt to cheat emissions tests.",
      "As part of the plea, Volkswagen paid a $2.8 billion criminal fine, and also agreed to pay another $1.5 billion in separate civil resolutions.",
      "After Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his first term, the EPA decided to start scrutinizing after-market emissions defeat devices and went on to make it an investigative priority.",
      "Untested defense bar arguments",
      "The push to kill all of the pending defeat device cases was championed by Adam Gustafson, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division who previously worked for Boeing and at the EPA, according to two of those sources and government records seen by CBS News.",
      "He has not specialized in the practice of criminal environmental law.",
      "Although Gustafson has previously signed off on at least some of the pending indictments involving after-market defeat devices, a new and novel defense bar argument that surfaced over the summer later changed his mind, the sources said.",
      "In July, an autobody shop owner named Tracy Coiteux appealed her criminal conviction under the Clean Air Act for tampering with emissions control systems before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Her attorneys put forth a legal theory alleging that she cannot be held criminally liable because the software associated with emission controls, known as \"onboard diagnostic systems,\" is not \"required to be maintained\" under the Clean Air Act.",
      "For this reason, they claimed that such an offense can only be charged as a civil violation, not a criminal one.",
      "Andy Mergen, a longtime former appellate lawyer in the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said Blanche's memo to prosecutors is \"essentially a confession of error,\" which complicates matters in the Ninth Circuit litigation because it means the department is now deciding that it was wrong to bring a case on which it ultimately prevailed at trial.",
      "\"Confession of error is an important responsibility of the Justice Department, and the process is intended to be rigorous. The decision is understood to be in the domain of the solicitor general,\" he told CBS.",
      "Making such a determination, he said, entails carefully weighing a variety of factors, including the reasonableness of the position, and the credibility of the U.S. government.",
      "\"Environmental crimes are challenging and deserve attention, but the process used here makes me question whether the rigorous standards that govern a confession of error were applied here,\" Mergen said.",
      "Lawyers for John and Josh Owens, a father and son who own a diesel truck products business in Washington state, have since raised similar arguments in an effort to get the charges against their clients dismissed.",
      "\"This is the right decision: the Clean Air Act was never intended to be used in this way to impose criminal liability,\" said Bill McSwain of Duane Morris. These prosecutions targeting hardworking American tradesmen were wrongheaded from the start. Our clients are pleased to put this misguided, weaponized case behind them.\" McSwain, who is counsel to Josh Owens and Diesel Truck Products, previously served as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "An internal EPA memo reviewed by CBS News shows that career attorneys disagree with the arguments made by defense lawyers in the 9th Circuit case. The memo argues that there are \"multiple respects\" in which diesel truck emissions software systems are \"required to be maintained\" under the law, and therefore tampering with them can be a crime.",
      "\"When Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, legislators sought to ensure that regulated motor vehicles/engines would meet applicable emission standards not only at the time of manufacture and initial sale, but thereafter in everyday use,\" the memo says.",
      "Although the 9th Circuit has not yet ruled on the matter, the legal theory resonated with Gustafson, who started raising questions about the pending cases, one of the sources said.",
      "After Lake was pardoned in November, the topic picked up steam and Gustafson began reaching out to prosecutors with pending cases and asked them to justify the criminal charges, two of the sources said.",
      "Because some of the pending cases are being handled by other U.S. attorney's offices and not by the office that Gustafson leads, he could not order all of the cases to be dismissed on his own.",
      "He sought support from Blanche's office, and also from the EPA's incoming head of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Jeffrey Hall, whom the Senate confirmed on Dec. 18, three sources said.",
      "Shortly before Blanche issued his memo, Hall told staff that he had \"carefully examined EPA enforcement for tampering with onboard diagnostic units\" and that after speaking with the Justice Department, he was directing EPA to \"no longer investigate or pursue criminal cases\" related to the tampering of emissions control software.",

    "story": [
      "A newly disclosed whistleblower complaint indicates that Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorized its officers to enter homes without judicial warrants in the cases of people with deportation orders, a sweeping reversal of longstanding rules.",
      "Historically, ICE has told its officers that they could not rely on administrative immigration warrants \u2014 signed by officials at the agency, not judges \u2014 to enter people's homes, due to constitutional protections against warrantless searches.",
      "But a May 2025 memo disclosed Wednesday by two U.S. government whistleblowers gave ICE officers permission to use those administrative immigration warrants to enter residences by force to arrest unauthorized immigrants who had been ordered deported by an immigration judge or court.",
      "The directive, signed by Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, \"Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.\"",
      "Lyons' memo empowered ICE officers to use the \"necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien's residence\" if the targets of operations do not allow them inside.",
      "Before any forced entry, ICE officers should knock on the residence's door and identify themselves. The memo also directed officers to conduct such operations targeting those with deportation orders after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m.",
      "Asked about the previously undisclosed directive, which was reported by The Associated Press earlier Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said those affected by the memo had been given \"full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,\" McLaughlin argued in her statement. \"For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.\"",
      "The directive is likely to trigger legal challenges, as the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been long interpreted to largely prohibit searches and seizures without judicial warrants, including in the immigration context.",
      "According to the whistleblower complaint, which was shared with Congress, Lyons' memo has not been shared widely within the agency but has been used to train ICE officers.",
      "\"The whistleblowers assert that this is a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment,\" said Whistleblower Aid, the non-profit representing the whistleblowers. \"This disclosure is particularly timely and relevant given recent news reports of ICE officers breaking into homes, including those of U.S. citizens, without a judicial warrant and forcibly removing the residents.\"",

It does not specify the focus of the assignment or required subject matter experience. A U.S. official told CBS News the Justice Department has asked the Pentagon for additional attorneys.",
      "The call for resources comes as the Justice Department is continuing and expanding its investigation into COVID-era welfare fraud in Minnesota. Nearly all of the defendants accused or convicted of defrauding a federal program to feed hungry children are of Somali descent. The Trump administration often refers to it as \"Somali-fraud.\"",
      "The city of Minneapolis is also the center of the largest deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in its history, who are there both for the fraud probe and to carry out immigration enforcement as part of what the Trump administration has dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge.\"",
      "The effort has the support of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the source added.",
      "Last week, Minneapolis' top fraud prosecutor and several others resigned, in part over concern that the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was not being probed as a civil rights case, and due to pressure to investigate Good's widow. The FBI is not currently investigating the agent who shot Good and prosecutors in the department's Civil Rights Division were previously ordered not to get involved.",
      "The additional resources from the Pentagon will help to augment the other efforts by the Justice Department to temporarily detail prosecutors from other neighboring districts in the coming weeks, including from parts of Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Wisconsin and North and South Dakota, the source added.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota recently lost about 10 prosecutors, some of whom handled criminal cases including the high-profile \"Feeding Our Futures\" fraud investigation. Career prosecutors who remain have largely been sidelined, sources tell CBS.",
      "The Pentagon referred questions to the Justice Department, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is not the first time military judge advocates have been used for non-military purposes. They have stepped in as immigration judges and were also called upon last summer to prosecute misdemeanor cases in Washington, D.C., during President Trump's crime crackdown.",

    "story": [
      "Data from the Federal Reserve shows that the so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy\u00a0in America is alive and well, with low- and middle-income households falling further behind as the richest Americans pull away.",
      "The top 1% of households owned 31.7% of all U.S. wealth in the third quarter of 2025, the highest share on record since the Federal Reserve began tracking household wealth in 1989. That share has increased even as wealth growth for the rest of the population has stalled or slowed, the data shows.",
      "Collectively, the wealthiest 1% held about $55 trillion in assets in the third quarter of 2025 \u2014 roughly equal to the wealth held by the bottom 90% of Americans combined.",
      "\"Household wealth is highly concentrated and becoming steadily more concentrated,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics, told CBS News.",
      "The latest snapshot of wealth inequality comes as billionaire fortunes continue to grow rapidly, both in the U.S. and abroad. An Oxfam International\u00a0report released this week found that billionaire wealth in 2025 increased three times faster than the average annual rate over the previous five years.",
      "The world's richest person is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth stands at $668 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "What's driving the growing divide",
      "Widening wealth inequality isn't new to the U.S., with the trend reaching back decades. However, the gap between the rich and the poor has become more skewed since the pandemic, according to Zandi.",
      "Consumer spending patterns underscore those disparities. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for nearly half of all U.S. consumer spending, according to Zandi's analysis of Federal Reserve data.",
      "The growing divide is being driven in part by surging stock prices, Zandi said.",
      "The stock market posted strong gains last year, thanks in large part to investments in artificial intelligence. Wealthier households tend to benefit most from bull markets because a larger share of their wealth is invested in stocks and other securities.",
      "According to\u00a0Gallup, 87% of Americans who own stocks are adults living in households earning $100,000 or more.",
      "Middle-income households, on the other hand, tend to have their wealth tied up in their homes, and house price growth has been slowing, Zandi added. Lower-income Americans are struggling with higher debt loads, he said.",
      "Uneven wage growth is also contributing to the divide. Higher-income Americans have seen their wages grow at a stronger clip than other income groups. Bank of America data\u00a0shows\u00a0that higher-income households' wage growth grew at 3% rate in December 2025, compared to 1.5% and 1.1% for middle- and low-income households.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",
      "The banking industry has opposed the cap, saying it would limit consumers' access to credit and steer them toward riskier lending products.",

      "Tafoya is seeking the open seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, as Republicans target a pickup opportunity in a state the GOP has not won statewide since 2006, when then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty was reelected. A Republican has not been elected to the U.S. Senate from Minnesota since Norm Coleman in 2002.",
      "\"I think Minnesota is in a crisis,\" Tafoya told CBS Minnesota station WCCO in an exclusive interview. \"I think we have a crisis in leadership and I think the career politicians that got us here are not going to get us out.\"",
      "\"In terms of policy, we've got a middle-class crisis,\" Tafoya said. \"We've got families struggling to pay rent, to pay mortgages, to put groceries on the table. Energy costs need to come down. Schools need to do better.\"",
      "Asked whether she supports President Trump's economic policies despite those struggles, Tafoya pointed to the lowering of gas prices and recent reports of rising GDP.",
      "\"It's only been a year, so let's see what happens here early 2026.\"",
      "CBS News can confirm Tafoya met last week with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to Republican sources familiar with the meeting. The Senate GOP's campaign arm has been recruiting Tafoya since Smith announced she would not seek reelection, as Republicans look to defend their current 53\u201347 majority in the upper chamber during this year's midterm elections. Tafoya's meeting with the NRSC was first reported by Fox News.",
      "Tafoya is entering a packed Republican primary that features former NBA player Royce White, the party's unsuccessful Senate nominee in 2024, along with former Minnesota GOP chair David Hann, U.S. Navy veteran Tom Weiler, and former Navy SEAL Adam Schwarze.",
      "On the Democratic side, a competitive primary is also taking shape between progressive Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and centrist Democratic Rep. Angie Craig. In a recent\u00a0interview with Newsweek, Craig said she believes Congress should impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem following the shooting death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in south Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month.",
      "Thousands of federal agents remain in the Twin Cities as part of a broader crackdown on immigration and an\u00a0escalating rhetorical and judicial fight between the Trump administration and local officials like Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",
      "\"What I wouldn't do is stir up this hatred for law enforcement,\" Tafoya asserted. \"No one has worked to calm the issue and say, 'Everyone let's take a breath. Everybody settle down. If you want to peacefully protest, that's OK.' What I've seen is the governor and the mayor stir people up and create this environment where they feel they should throw their cars and their bodies between law enforcement and their mission. That's not how you'll get peace and normalcy here.\"",
      "In total, roughly 3,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents have been dispatched to the Twin Cities, a force that is nearly five times the size of the Minneapolis police department, which employs about 600 officers.",
      "Tafoya told WCCO, \"I want public safety and I back law enforcement. So I would really like it if Minnesota's law enforcement could work with federal law enforcement to make this as safe and as peaceful for everyone. That keeps the officers safe and that keeps the public safe.\"",
      "Tafoya spent about a decade as a sideline reporter for NBC Sports' \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" before ending her tenure in 2021. She also had stints during her long sports broadcasting career with ABC Sports, ESPN and CBS Sports. In 2022, she served as co-chair for Kendall Qualls, a Republican gubernatorial candidate who is running again in this year's governor's race.",

Instead, it urges parents and pediatricians to consider the broader digital ecosystem children are navigating, including how platforms are designed, how social pressures operate and how constant connectivity can shape daily life.",

      "Beltr\u00e1n played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball, making the All-Star team nine times and ending with a career .279 average with 435 homers and 1,587 RBI. He is one of only five players in league history with 500 doubles, 400 homers and 300 steals, according to MLB. The others are Alex Rodr\u00edguez, Barry Bonds, Andre Dawson and Willie Mays.",

    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said he will not be imposing tariffs against European countries over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland, revealing Wednesday that he and the secretary-general of NATO reached \"the framework of a future deal\" regarding the island.",
      "\"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post from Davos, Switzerland, following a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "In an interview with CNBC shortly after his post, the president said \"we have a concept of a deal\" and that he thinks it will be \"a very good deal for the United States, also for them.\"",
      "\"We're going to work together on something having to do with the Arctic as a whole, but also Greenland. And it has to do with the security, great security, strong security, and other things,\" he said.",
      "He declined to provide specifics of the framework, saying \"it's a little bit complex\" and that the U.S. will \"explain it down the line.\" He did note that the agreement would last \"forever.\"",
      "\"It's the kind of a deal that I wanted to be able to make,\" Mr. Trump told CNBC.",
      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan that that there is no agreement for U.S. control or ownership of Greenland. The framework of the deal, according to the sources, would ramp up security for Greenland beyond the existing 1951 U.S. agreement, which allowed the U.S. to establish several military bases on the island, although the only one that is still operating is Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base. It would also increase NATO's role with the specific intent of blocking Russia and China from gaining a foothold in Greenland, the sources said. But such a deal would still need to be directly negotiated with Denmark and Greenland.",
      "U.S. ownership of the territory is still a red line for Denmark and Greenland, the sources said.",
      "NATO was similarly tight-lipped about details of the arrangement. In a statement, Allison Hart, a spokesperson for the alliance, said Mr. Trump and Rutte's meeting was \"very productive\" and that they \"discussed the critical significance of security in the Arctic region to all Allies, including the United States.\"",
      "\"Discussions among NATO Allies on the framework the President referenced will focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts of Allies, especially the seven Arctic Allies,\" Hart said. \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold \u2014 economically or militarily \u2014 in Greenland.\"",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, also issued a statement, saying the day \"is ending on a better note than it began.\"",
      "\"We welcome that President Trump has ruled out to take Greenland by force and paused the trade war with Europe. Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" it said.",
      "The president addressed the annual meeting of global leaders at the World Economic Forum earlier in the day and reiterated his insistence that the U.S. needs to own the semi-autonomous Danish territory for security reasons. But, for the first time, he ruled out the use of military force to take control of the island, and said he was instead \"seeking immediate negotiations\" over the territory.",
      "Over the weekend, the president threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that opposed his Greenland push beginning next month, and said the tariff would increase to 25% if the U.S. did not acquire the island. The threat of a trade war with longstanding allies sent shockwaves through European capitals, with leaders scrambling to address the threat and defend Greenland and Denmark's autonomy before gathering in Davos.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that owning Greenland is critical for completing his \"Golden Dome\" missile defense shield, and that NATO should back his acquisition of the territory to defend against Russia and China. In his Truth Social post, he said that discussions over the missile shield will continue.",
      "\"Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland,\" he said. \"Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations \u2014 They will report directly to me.\"",

      "The president now says the\u00a0\"framework\" for a deal is in the works. Here's why Mr. Trump insists the U.S. needs the semi-autonomous Danish territory, and why NATO allies and Greenland say the U.S. could achieve its aims without a takeover.",
      "Greenland's strategic location",

      "Climate change means new shipping routes will open up through the Arctic.",
      "Greenland is the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it inside the Arctic Circle and covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people.",
      "Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic.",
      "Greenland is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base \u2014 the Pituffik Space Base, which was established during World War II.",
      "National security",
      "President Trump has said Chinese and Russian activity around Greenland is a security threat to the United States.The threat of Chinese and Russian ships around Greenland is disputed.Danish politicians have said the U.S. could put additional troops or equipment on Greenland just by asking.",
      "President Trump has said Chinese and Russian activity around Greenland is a security threat to the United States.",
      "The threat of Chinese and Russian ships around Greenland is disputed.",
      "Danish politicians have said the U.S. could put additional troops or equipment on Greenland just by asking.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Jan. 4, claiming \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",
      "The Danish government has made it clear that the U.S. is welcome to expand its military presence in Greenland, and that protecting the island from any potential adversaries should be the joint responsibility of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said, \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",
      "When asked earlier this month what specifically the United States would gain in terms of national security by taking control of Greenland, given all that the U.S. is able to do already, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region. And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages.The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages.",
      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",
      "Greenland's natural resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.It would be very expensive to explore and develop those resources.Greenland has long said it's open for business if American companies are interested in exploring.",

      "It would be very expensive to explore and develop those resources.",
      "Greenland has long said it's open for business if American companies are interested in exploring.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "Would Trump use military force to take Greenland?",
      "Mr. Trump said on Jan. 21, \"I don't want to use force, I won't use force\" to take Greenland.He had previously declined to take the option off the table, saying the U.S. could do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way.\"",

      "President Trump, for the first time,\u00a0ruled out using force to acquire Greenland in his speech at the 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But, I won't do that. Okay?\" he said in his address on Jan. 21. \"Now everyone's saying 'oh, good.' That's probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"seeking immediate negotiations\" \u2014 and then announced, after a meeting with the NATO secretary general, that a\u00a0\"framework of a future deal\" had been reached.",
      "Previously, the president and White House officials had suggested military force was among the options being considered.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0on Jan. 9, without explaining what that could involve. The White House stated that a range of options, including the use of military force, were under consideration.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\"\u00a0he said Jan. 11.",

      "As he's sought to justify his efforts, Mr. Trump has claimed in interviews and conversations with world leaders that Denmark has no legal claim to Greenland. He's also exaggerated threats from China and Russia, and falsely suggested Denmark provides almost no defense for the island.",
      "Here's a closer look at several of those claims.",
      "Trump's claim that Denmark has no legal right to Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a text exchange with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re on Jan. 19: \u00a0\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Details:\u00a0In the text exchange with St\u00f8re, Mr. Trump questioned Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland, writing there are \"no written documents\" establishing ownership.",
      "The claim is false.",
      "There are written agreements and court rulings establishing Denmark's claim to Greenland, including a declaration by the U.S. secretary of state in 1916 which explicitly recognized Danish control over the territory. An international court also ruled in 1933 that Denmark held valid sovereignty over the entire island.",
      "Danish explorers and settlers began colonizing Greenland in the early 1700s, at a time when the U.S. was still a British colony.",
      "\"Danish expeditions reached and settled Greenland centuries ago,\" Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told CBS News in an email. \"Since then, Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland has been internationally recognized, including by the U.S., just as similar claims are recognized for many other nations around the world.\"",
      "Trump's claim that Russian and Chinese ships surround Greenland",
      "Trump said in a press gaggle\u00a0on Jan. 4: \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\" (Press gaggle, January 4)",
      "Mr. Trump said at a Jan. 9 press conference: \"We need that because if you take a look outside of Greenland right now, there are Russian destroyers. There are Chinese destroyers and bigger. There are Russian submarines all over the place. We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland, and that's what they're going to do if we don't.\"",
      "Details: Trump has also repeatedly claimed that a large number of Russian and Chinese ships are currently operating near Greenland.",
      "There is no evidence to support that claim.",
      "Greenland's minister of business Naaja Nathanielsen said she was \"not aware\" of any Russian and Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland when asked about Mr.Trump's comments\u00a0 earlier this month.",
      "Public ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic does not show any Russian- or Chinese-flagged commercial vessels around Greenland, with most traffic consisting of fishing boats. While vessels can turn off their transponders or spoof their locations, experts say there is no indication of the large-scale naval presence Mr. Trump has described.",
      "\"The claim by President Trump of Russian and Chinese ships all over the place does not hold,\"\u00a0 Romain Chuffart, the managing director of The Arctic Institute, a non-profit think tank, told CBS News by email.",
      "Other experts have noted that Russian naval activity in the Arctic is concentrated near Norway, while China's Arctic involvement has focused on trade with Russia and exercises near Alaska.",
      "Trump's claim that Denmark's defenses in Greenland consist of \"two dog sleds\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Jan. 11: \"And Greenland basically, their defense is two dog sleds. Do you know that? You know what their defense is? Two dog sleds.\"",
      "Details: \u00a0In jest or not, that is incorrect. While Danish special forces do operate the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol \u2014 a special force which patrols remote, icy areas using sled dogs \u2014 that is just one part of its military presence.",
      "Denmark deploys Arctic patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft, and maintains a military base in Nuuk with about 150 personnel, according to the Danish Ministry of Defense.",
      "Danish officials have also committed roughly $6.5 billion to modernize military capabilities in Greenland over the next decade, Chuffart said.",
      "As for the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, the 12-person team uses dog sleds because it is \"the most adequate mode of transportation in the region,\" \u00a0according to Chuffart.",
      "The U.S. already operates an air base in Greenland and has the option to expand its presence under a 1951 agreement with Denmark. Danish officials have said they would welcome greater U.S. cooperation on security \u2014 but insist Greenland is not for sale.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",

      "CBS News confirmed that more than 50 countries have been invited to join as of Wednesday, Jan. 21.",
      "Among them is Russia, despite its continued assault on Ukraine and the Trump administration's statement that the country poses such a threat to national security that the U.S. must acquire Greenland to counter it.",
      "Mr. Trump said\u00a0he has sent an invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Belarus, which has provided material support to Russia during its invasion of Ukraine, was also invited and its president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, accepted.",
      "It isn't clear what criteria the White House is using to decide which countries are being invited to join.",
      "Who has joined the Board of Peace and who has declined?",
      "As many as 25 countries have signed on to join the Board of Peace, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said. But so far only a handful have said so publicly.",
      "\"I think we have north of 20, maybe 25 world leaders who have already accepted,\" Witkoff said in an interview in Davos with CNBC on Wednesday.",
      "Israel, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Morocco, Hungary, Qatar and Canada are among the nations that have announced they're accepting Mr. Trump's invitation.",
      "Other countries are considering their invitations.",
      "In a joint statement, officials from Qatar, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the UAE and Saudi Arabia said they welcomed the invitations to join the body.",
      "Norway and Sweden said Wednesday they're holding off, at least for now, due to concerns about the terms for joining.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News earlier this week that France intended to decline due to concerns that the Board of Peace charter goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises major issues, particularly regarding respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said Monday night he would impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne if they did not join the Board of Peace. The White House has not responded to several inquiries as to whether or not the president was joking.",
      "A French official said they have taken note of Mr. Trump's statements and called the use of tariff threats to influence France's foreign policy unacceptable and ineffective.",
      "Is the Board of Peace intended to replace the United Nations?",
      "President Trump said the Board of Peace \"might\" replace the United Nations.",
      "\"I mean, the U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I'm a big fan of the U.N. potential. But it has never lived up to its potential,\" he said in a more than 90-minute press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Jan. 20.",
      "But he added, \"I believe you've got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great.\"",
      "The following day, CNBC's Sara Eisen noted to Witkoff in an interview that \"some people say it's a U.N. alternative.\"",
      "\"No, no, it's just, it's a great group of leaders coming together with great opinion and sharing opinion to achieve peace, and that's what we need,\" Witkoff responded. \"Sometimes I say that my title should be the Secretary of Miscommunication, and the President is doing that. He's cleaning up miscommunication out there. He's bringing people together so that we can solve conflict.\"",
      "In November, the United Nations passed a Security Council resolution that approved a \"Board of Peace,\" but with a focus limited only to Gaza.",
      "The resolution welcomed the establishment of a Board of Peace \"as a transitional administration with international legal personality\" that would set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. resolution more broadly endorsed the Trump administration's 20-point Gaza peace plan, and authorized countries working with the Board of Peace to establish a stabilization force inside the Palestinian territory.",
      "Is a financial contribution required to join?",
      "A U.S. official confirmed a Bloomberg report that countries can contribute $1 billion to the Board of Peace to become permanent members instead of having a three-year membership. The official also said it isn't a requirement to contribute to become a member.",
      "The official told CBS News that any contributions will be used to rebuild Gaza and said \"virtually every dollar\" raised will be spent on the Board's mandate. There will be no \"exorbitant salaries\" or \"administrative bloat,\" the official said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/water-bankruptcy-world-un-report/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:33:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Water sources are being depleted faster than they can be restored, according to a new report from United Nations researchers.",
    "story": [
      "The planet is entering an era of global \"water bankruptcy,\" a United Nations research agency said in a new report, which warns that humans' water use over the long term has exceeded the renewable water sources worldwide and, potentially, passed a point of no return.",
      "\"Bankruptcy\" means the Earth's water repositories, such as rivers, lakes and aquifers, are being depleted at faster rates than they can be restored, according to the\u00a0report from researchers at the United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH).",
      "\"In many regions, human-water systems are already in a post-crisis state of failure,\" the report's authors wrote.",
      "That failure, they say, is a result of decades of overstretching, in which \"societies have withdrawn more water than climate and hydrology can reliably provide\" while environmental factors like pollution shrank the amount of water that can be safely used by degrading its quality. The consequences are measurable, especially in deeply affected regions in the Middle East and North Africa, parts of South Asia and the American Southwest.",
      "There are dozens of major rivers that fail to reach the sea for parts of the year, and many river basins and aquifers have been \"overdrawing\" their shares of water for at least the last five decades, according to the report. Half of the world's large lakes have lost water since the early 1990s, a pattern of decline that impacts roughly 25% of the global population. Researchers say increased demand for that water, as well as changing inflows and rising temperatures, are largely to blame.",
      "While river basins also experience alterations in their typical flow, the wetland environments that scientists describe as traditional \"shock absorbers\" for the water cycle are disappearing, too. More than 1 billion acres of natural wetlands have been erased over the last 50 years \u2014 an area that is roughly equal to the size of continental Europe \u2014 threatening the communities they normally help to protect from floods and drought.",
      "\"These are not simply signs of stress or episodes of crisis,\" the report said. \"They are symptoms of systems that have overspent their hydrological budget and eroded the natural capital that once made recovery possible, with knock-off effects for food prices, employment, migration and geopolitical stability.\"",
      "About 75% of the human population reside in countries that have been classified as \"water-insecure\" or \"critically water-insecure,\" according to the report. That means their nations cannot reliably provide them with enough water that meets basic safety and quality standards.",
      "Within that group, some 4 billion people face severe water scarcities for at least one month each year, 3.5 billion lack safely managed sanitation and 2.2 billion lack safely managed drinking water, the report said. Another 3 billion live in areas where the total water storage is declining or unstable, and at least half of the world's food is produced in those same regions.",
      "\"Millions of farmers are trying to grow more food from shrinking, polluted, or disappearing water sources,\" said Kaveh Madani, director of the UNU-INWEH and the report's lead author, in a statement. \"Without rapid transitions toward water-smart agriculture, water bankruptcy will spread rapidly.\"",
      "The report recommended a combination of efforts to address the water bankruptcy, including aiming to restore what has been lost, staving off ongoing depletion and adapting to the amount of usable water that exists now.",
      "\"Water bankruptcy is becoming a driver of fragility, displacement, and conflict,\" said U.N. Under-Secretary-General Tshilidzi Marwala in a separate statement. \"Managing it fairly \u2014 ensuring that vulnerable communities are protected and that unavoidable losses are shared equitably \u2014 is now central to maintaining peace, stability, and social cohesion.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:09:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The fingers of one of the hands were \"retouched to become pointed like claws,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "A red stencil of a hand pressed against the wall of an Indonesian cave is the oldest rock art ever discovered, scientists said Wednesday, and sheds light on how humans first migrated to Australia.",
      "The cave art dates back at least 67,800 years, according to research published in the journal Nature by a team of Indonesian and Australian archaeologists.",
      "\"We have been working in Indonesia for a long time,\" study co-author Maxime Aubert of Australia's Griffith University told AFP.",
      "This time they ventured to caves on the island of Muna in the Sulawesi province on the advice of Indonesian archaeologist Adhi Agus Oktaviana, the study's lead author.",
      "There they found \"handprints in negative, stenciled, probably using red ochre,\" Aubert said.",
      "The fingers of one of the hands were \"retouched to become pointed like claws -- a style of painting only seen in Sulawesi,\" the Canadian archaeologist added.",
      "Study co-author Adam Brumm told Reuters the claw-shaped design \"had some deeper cultural meaning but we don't know what that was.\"",
      "\"I suspect it was something to do with these ancient peoples' complex symbolic relationship with the animal world,\" Brumm told Reuters.",
      "To determine the art's age, the team took five-millimeter samples from \"cave popcorn,\" which are small clusters of calcite that form on the walls of limestone caves.",
      "Then they zapped the layers of rock with a laser to measure how the uranium decayed over time, compared to a more stable radioactive element called thorium.",
      "This \"very precise\" technique gave the scientists a clear minimum age for the painting, Aubert explained.",
      "At 67,800 years old, the Indonesian stencil is more than a thousand years older than other hand stencils found in a Spanish cave which has been attributed to Neanderthals. However the dating of that cave art \"has been controversial,\" the study cautioned.",
      "The new discovery is also more than 15,000 years older than previous art found in the Sulawesi region by the same team.",
      "The scientists also established that the Muna caves had been used for rock art many times over a long period.",
      "Some of the ancient art was even painted over up to 35,000 later, Aubert said.",
      "A fork in the road",
      "Beyond setting a new record, the art also offers clues for a long-running historical mystery.",
      "Scientists have been divided about how Homo sapiens first journeyed from Asia to Australia.",
      "They could have taken the northern route, travelling by boat through Indonesia islands including Sulawesi to Papua New Guinea.",
      "These ancient humans could then have walked the rest of the way -- at the time, Papua New Guinea and Australia were both part of a supercontinent called Sahul.",
      "Or the migrants could have taken the southern route, travelling through the islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali before heading for Timor. Then a boat ride was required to finally make it to Australia.",
      "\"These paintings provide the first evidence that modern humans were on these Indonesian islands at that time,\" Aubert said.",
      "The discovery also \"reinforces the idea that people arrived in Australia via Papua, perhaps around 65,000 years ago,\" he said.",
      "But it could not be ruled that other people were also making their way to Australia via the southern route at the same time, he added.",
      "The researchers also said that the paintings were very likely created by people closely linked to the ancestors of Indigenous Australians.",
      "In 2018, Aubert led a team of scientists that found the oldest known example of an animal drawing: a red silhouette of a bull-like beast on the wall of a different Indonesian cave. Researchers said that sketch was at least 40,000 years old, slightly older than similar\u00a0animal paintings\u00a0found in famous caves in France and Spain.",
      "Cave paintings of prehistoric marine life -- dating back more than 30,000 years -- have also been found at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea off southern France.",

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney accused President Trump of rupturing the world order through economic coercion, and warned that we are entering a \"harsh reality\" where the most powerful nations observe \"no limits, no constraints.\"",
      "In his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Monday, Carney called on \"middle powers\" like Canada to join together, build on their strengths and create a new order, based on \"our values,\" that's less reliant on the United States.",
      "Below is a transcript of Carney's speech, which was delivered in both English and French, provided by the World Economic Forum.",
      "Read Carney's full speech",
      "It is both a pleasure, and a duty, to be with you tonight in this pivotal moment that Canada and the world [are] going through.",
      "Today, I will talk about a rupture in the world order, the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality, where geopolitics, where the large, main power, geopolitics, is submitted to no limits, no constraints.",
      "On the other hand, I would like to tell you that the other countries, especially intermediate powers like Canada, are not powerless. They have the capacity to build a new order that encompasses our values, such as respect for human rights, sustainable development, solidarity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the various states.",
      "The power of the less power starts with honesty.",
      "It seems that every day we're reminded that we live in an era of great power rivalry, that the rules based order is fading, that the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must.",
      "And this aphorism of Thucydides is presented as inevitable, as the natural logic of international relations reasserting itself.",
      "And faced with this logic, there is a strong tendency for countries to go along to get along, to accommodate, to avoid trouble, to hope that compliance will buy safety.",
      "Well, it won't.",
      "So, what are our options?",
      "In 1978, the Czech dissident V\u00e1clav Havel, later president, wrote an essay called The Power of the Powerless, and in it, he asked a simple question: how did the communist system sustain itself?",
      "And his answer began with a greengrocer.",
      "Every morning, this shopkeeper places a sign in his window: 'Workers of the world unite'. He doesn't believe it, no-one does, but he places a sign anyway to avoid trouble, to signal compliance, to get along. And because every shopkeeper on every street does the same, the system persist \u2014 not through violence alone, but through the participation of ordinary people in rituals they privately know to be false.",
      "Havel called this \"living within a lie.\"",
      "The system's power comes not from its truth, but from everyone's willingness to perform as if it were true, and its fragility comes from the same source. When even one person stops performing, when the greengrocer removes his sign, the illusion begins to crack. Friends, it is time for companies and countries to take their signs down.",
      "For decades, countries like Canada prospered under what we called the rules-based international order. We joined its institutions, we praised its principles, we benefited from its predictability. And because of that, we could pursue values-based foreign policies under its protection.",
      "We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false \u2014 that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigor depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.",
      "This fiction was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.",
      "So, we placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality.",
      "This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.",
      "Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.",
      "You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration, when integration becomes the source of your subordination.",
      "The multilateral institutions on which the middle powers have relied \u2014 the WTO, the UN, the COP \u2014 the architecture, the very architecture of collective problem solving are under threat. And as a result, many countries are drawing the same conclusions that they must develop greater strategic autonomy, in energy, food, critical minerals, in finance and supply chains.",
      "And this impulse is understandable. A country that can't feed itself, fuel itself or defend itself, has few options. When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself.",
      "But let's be clear eyed about where this leads.",
      "A world of fortresses will be poorer, more fragile and less sustainable. And there is another truth. If great powers abandon even the pretense of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power and interests, the gains from transactionalism will become harder to replicate.",
      "Hegemons cannot continually monetize their relationships.",
      "Allies will diversify to hedge against uncertainty.",
      "They'll buy insurance, increase options in order to rebuild sovereignty \u2014 sovereignty that was once grounded in rules, but will increasingly be anchored in the ability to withstand pressure.",
      "This room knows this is classic risk management. Risk management comes at a price, but that cost of strategic autonomy, of sovereignty can also be shared.",
      "Collective investments in resilience are cheaper than everyone building their own fortresses. Shared standards reduce fragmentations. Complementarities are positive sum. And the question for middle powers like Canada is not whether to adapt to the new reality \u2014 we must. The question is whether we adapt by simply building higher walls, or whether we can do something more ambitious.",
      "Now Canada was amongst the first to hear the wake-up call, leading us to fundamentally shift our strategic posture.",
      "Canadians know that our old, comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security \u2014 that assumption is no longer valid. And our new approach rests on what Alexander Stubb, the President of Finland, has termed \"value-based realism.\"",
      "Or, to put another way, we aim to be both principled and pragmatic \u2014 principled in our commitment to fundamental values, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the prohibition of the use of force, except when consistent with the UN Charter, and respect for human rights, and pragmatic and recognizing that progress is often incremental, that interests diverge, that not every partner will share all of our values.",
      "So, we're engaging broadly, strategically with open eyes. We actively take on the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish to be.",
      "We are calibrating our relationships, so their depth reflects our values, and we're prioritizing broad engagement to maximize our influence, given and given the fluidity of the world at the moment, the risks that this poses and the stakes for what comes next.",
      "And we are no longer just relying on the strength of our values, but also the value of our strength.",
      "We are building that strength at home.",
      "Since my government took office, we have cut taxes on incomes, on capital gains and business investment. We have removed all federal barriers to interprovincial trade. We are fast tracking a trillion dollars of investments in energy, AI, critical minerals, new trade corridors and beyond. We're doubling our defence spending by the end of this decade, and we're doing so in ways that build our domestic industries.",
      "And we are rapidly diversifying abroad. We have agreed a comprehensive strategic partnership with the EU, including joining SAFE, the European defence procurement arrangements. We have signed 12 other trade and security deals on four continents in six months. The past few days, we've concluded new strategic partnerships with China and Qatar. We're negotiating free trade pacts with India, ASEAN, Thailand, Philippines and Mercosur.",
      "We're doing something else. To help solve global problems, we're pursuing variable geometry, in other words, different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests. So, on Ukraine, we're a core member of the Coalition of the Willing and one of the largest per capita contributors to its defence and security.",
      "On Arctic sovereignty, we stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark, and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future.",
      "Our commitment to NATO's Article 5 is unwavering, so we're working with our NATO allies, including the Nordic Baltic Gate, to further secure the alliance's northern and western flanks, including through Canada's unprecedented investments in over-the-horizon radar, in submarines, in aircraft and boots on the ground, boots on the ice.",
      "Canada strongly opposes tariffs over Greenland and calls for focused talks to achieve our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic.",
      "On plurilateral trade, we're championing efforts to build a bridge between the Trans Pacific Partnership and the European Union, which would create a new trading bloc of 1.5 billion people. On critical minerals, we're forming buyers' clubs anchored in the G7 so the world can diversify away from concentrated supply. And on AI, we're cooperating with like-minded democracies to ensure that we won't ultimately be forced to choose between hegemons and hyper-scalers.",
      "This is not naive multilateralism, nor is it relying on their institutions. It's building coalitions that work \u2014 issues by issue, with partners who share enough common ground to act together.",
      "In some cases, this will be the vast majority of nations.",
      "What it's doing is creating a dense web of connections across trade, investment, culture, on which we can draw for future challenges and opportunities.",
      "Argue, the middle powers must act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.",
      "But I'd also say that great powers, great powers can afford for now to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity and the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not.",
      "But when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what's offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating.",
      "This is not sovereignty. It's the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination. In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice \u2014 compete with each other for favour, or to combine to create a third path with impact.",
      "We shouldn't allow the rise of hard power to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity and rules will remain strong, if we choose to wield them together \u2014 which brings me back to Havel.",
      "What does it mean for middle powers to live the truth?",
      "First, it means naming reality. Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is \u2014 a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests, using economic integration as coercion.",
      "It means acting consistently, applying the same standards to allies and rivals. When middle powers criticize economic intimidation from one direction, but stay silent when it comes from another, we are keeping the sign in the window.",
      "It means building what we claim to believe in, rather than waiting for the old order to be restored. It means creating institutions and agreements that function as described. And it means reducing the leverage that enables coercion \u2014 that's building a strong domestic economy. It should be every government's immediate priority.",
      "And diversification internationally is not just economic prudence, it's a material foundation for honest foreign policy, because countries earn the right to principled stands by reducing their vulnerability to retaliation.",
      "So Canada. Canada has what the world wants. We are an energy superpower. We hold vast reserves of critical minerals. We have the most educated population in the world. Our pension funds are amongst the world's largest and most sophisticated investors. In other words, we have capital, talent \u2026 we also have a government with immense fiscal capacity to act decisively. And we have the values to which many others aspire.",
      "Canada is a pluralistic society that works. Our public square is loud, diverse and free. Canadians remain committed to sustainability. We are a stable and reliable partner in a world that is anything but.. A partner that builds and values relationships for the long term.",
      "And we have something else. We have a recognition of what's happening and a determination to act accordingly. We understand that this rupture calls for more than adaptation. It calls for honesty about the world as it is.",
      "We are taking the sign out of the window. We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn't mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy, but we believe that from the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just. This is the task of the middle powers, the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and most to gain from genuine cooperation.",
      "The powerful have their power.",
      "But we have something too \u2014 the capacity to stop pretending, to name reality, to build our strength at home and to act together.",
      "That is Canada's path. We choose it openly and confidently, and it is a path wide open to any country willing to take it with us. Thank you very much.",

      "The year-long operation involved police from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, Europol said.",
      "The agency released video of the operations, showing officers conducting raids, making arrests and seizing evidence. Europol said police conducted 50 house searches -\u2014 45 in Poland, two in Belgium, two in Germany and one in the Netherlands.",
      "More than 85 arrests were made, including the two suspected ringleaders, both from Poland, Kraag said. Europol called the alleged ringleaders \"high-value targets.\"",
      "Suspicions were raised back in 2024 when Polish police noticed a network importing vast quantities of legal chemicals from China and India.",
      "\"These precursors were legal, generally used in the pharmaceutical industry,\" but the quantities acquired and processed were \"very large, unrelated to the actual needs of the companies\" acting as fronts for the trafficking, the Polish police stressed.",
      "Investigations later showed these chemicals were being repackaged, mislabeled and redistributed across the European Union to labs that manufactured the synthetic drugs.",
      "Polish police released footage of the operation showing dozens of drums and tanks containing the precursors stored in various warehouses, as well as processing labs raided by heavily armed investigators.",
      "The majority of those arrested were from Poland, but Belgian and Dutch nationals are also thought to have been involved in the criminal operations.",
      "\"The operational structure of this criminal network was complex, with seven legal companies in Poland facilitating the import and distribution activities, and high-level leadership coordination connecting the different criminal groups across EU countries,\" Europol said.",
      "\"Supply-chain strategy\"",
      "Kraag said the operation was part of a \"supply-chain strategy\" to choke off the synthetic drug industry at its source.",
      "\"These criminal groups, they don't have their supply anymore,\" he told AFP.",
      "To prevent future trafficking on a similar scale, Chief Commander of the Polish Police Marek Boron told AFP that law enforcement was \"constantly updating the list of precursors entering the market.\"",
      "\"We are constantly at the stage of determining which chemicals are currently being misused for drug production,\" he added.",
      "Aside from the health risks associated with using these drugs, Kraag pointed to the related problems of violence, corruption and money-laundering in this criminal field.",
      "Synthetic drug production also carries a damaging environmental impact, he noted.",
      "Authorities seized more than 120,000 liters, or 31,700 gallons, of toxic chemical waste that the criminals usually dump on land or in streams.",
      "\"Today, it's profit for criminals. Tomorrow, it's pollution,\" said Kraag.",

    "story": [
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called President Trump's threat to hit eight of America's NATO allies with tariffs over their stance on Greenland a \"mistake\" on Tuesday. Speaking at the opening of the Davos economic conference in Switzerland, Von der Leyen said Mr. Trump's threat risked plunging Europe's relations with the U.S. into a \"downward spiral.\"",
      "\"When it comes to the security of the Arctic region, Europe is fully committed and we share the objectives of the United States,\" von der Leyen said, highlighting as an example a move by Finland, NATO's newest member, to sell ice breakers to the U.S.",
      "\"It shows that our northern NATO members have Arctic-ready forces right now. And above all, that Arctic security can only be achieved together. And this is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July, and in politics, and in business, a deal is a deal, and when friends shake hands, it must mean something,\" von der Leyen said.",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark for more than 70 years, and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told the country's parliament on Tuesday that, \"the worst may still be ahead of us\" regarding the standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We are now being threatened by our closest ally,\" she said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Both Frederiksen's and Von der Leyen's remarks came after President Trump threatened to impose a blanket 10% tariff on imports from eight NATO allies, including Denmark, if they continue rejecting his bid to acquire Greenland. Mr. Trump has said those tariffs could rise to 25% by June if the countries continue resisting.",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU's 27 member nations, \"consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends, and plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape. So our response will be unflinching, united and proportional.\"",
      "She said the EU was working on a package of measures to further support Arctic security, the first principle of which is \"full solidarity with Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"The sovereignty and integrity of their territory is non-negotiable,\" Von der Leyen said, adding that the EU would work with Greenland and Denmark to look at how it could support infrastructure there, as well as \"work with the United States and all partners on wider Arctic security. This is clearly in our shared interest, and we will step up investment.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is not attending the Davos conference, said his government had met with NATO members and other allies, and that Western countries should be united by \"respect for national, territorial integrity (and) respect for international law,\" according to The Associated Press.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reza-valizadeh-detained-iran/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:44:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for Reza Valizadeh, a U.S. citizen arrested in 2024 by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, filed a petition Tuesday with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.",
    "story": [
      "When Abdolreza \"Reza\" Valizadeh returned to Iran in the spring of 2024, it was the first time he had set foot in his home country in 15 years. The veteran journalist, who had spent more than a decade in exile, traveled to Iran to see and care for his aging parents.",
      "Six months later, he was in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.",
      "Valizadeh, a 49-year-old dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and longtime critic of Iran's security establishment, was arrested on Sept. 22, 2024, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His detention, detailed in a petition filed Tuesday by his attorney with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, comes amid Iran's sweeping crackdown on protests across the country, and as tensions with Washington simmer.",
      "The State Department formally designated Valizadeh as \"wrongfully detained\" in May 2025, placing his case under the authority of the U.S. government's hostage affairs office. Valizadeh is one of at least four Iranian-Americans currently held in Iran, including 70-year-old Kamran Hekmati and at least one other septuagenarian, a woman, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"In lodging this petition to the UN, alongside pulling every lever of power available to us in D.C., we are committed to bringing attention to Reza's case, not only to secure his release, but to send an unequivocal message that the targeting of U.S. citizens abroad will not be tolerated,\" Ryan Fayhee, counsel to Valizadeh and a partner at the law firm Akin Gump, said in a statement.",
      "\"Every day that Reza remains behind bars, the Iranian regime is emboldened to target Americans who dare to advocate for truth, justice, and a better future for the Iranian people,\" Fayhee said.",
      "Valizadeh's case continues to unfold against a volatile backdrop inside Iran, where thousands of protesters\u00a0are believed to have been killed, and many thousands more arrested, as authorities have cracked down on recent demonstrations over economic hardship and political repression. A near-total internet and communications blackout has been in place for more than two weeks.",
      "U.S. officials have condemned Tehran's treatment of protesters, warning of further economic pressure \u2014 and possible military strikes \u2014 while leaving open the possibility of talks. Iranian leaders have accused Washington of interference, raising concerns among rights advocates that Americans held in Iran could be used as leverage as tensions sharpen.",
      "President Trump said last week he held off on striking Iran after being assured by the regime that the executions of hundreds of protesters had been \"canceled,\" but in a recent interview called for \"new leadership\" in Iran. The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group has begun to move west from the Indo-Pacific towards the Middle East, CBS News has confirmed, and is expected to arrive in the coming days.",
      "\"The Trump administration is closely monitoring Mr. Valizadeh's case. President Trump has been clear that he wants every wrongfully detained American returned home,\" a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The State Department and a spokesperson for the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "\"These Americans must come home\"",
      "Valizadeh became a U.S. citizen in 2022 through his work for U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Farda, the Persian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "According to messages relayed to his attorney by his family, Valizadeh believed he had been given assurances by Iranian authorities that it was safe to return to Tehran, where most of his family resides. His brother has said he now believes those guarantees were part of a trap, possibly involving a former colleague who had ties to the IRGC.",
      "Reporting by Persian-language media later cited sources who said Iranian intelligence had hoped to pressure Valizadeh into cooperating against his former employer, Radio Farda, for which he reported on corruption, protests and the influence of the IRGC. He refused.",
      "Days later, IRGC agents detained him on a Tehran street, confiscated his belongings, including his U.S. passport, and took him to Evin Prison, where he spent weeks in isolation and under intense interrogation. Iranian officials did not publicly acknowledge his arrest for nearly two months.",
      "Valizadeh was eventually charged with \"collaborating with a hostile government,\" a vague national security offense that Iranian authorities routinely use against journalists and activists.",
      "In December 2024, after what the petition to the U.N. describes as a sham trial lasting less than an hour, and in which the judge acted as both prosecutor and adjudicator, Valizadeh was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His appeal to the regime was rejected in January 2025.",
      "Since then, his family says Valizadeh's health has steadily deteriorated. He suffers from asthma, which has been worsened by overcrowded cells, poor air quality and exposure to smoke and debris \u2014 conditions that intensified after Israeli airstrikes struck parts of Evin Prison in June 2025 during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He has endured frequent coughing fits and has been denied basic medications, dental care and treatment for gastrointestinal problems.",
      "After the June strikes, Valizadeh was among prisoners who were shackled and transferred to another facility without their belongings or medicine, according to the U.N. filing, before being returned to Evin Prison, where his brother says he now shares a small cell with up to 18 other inmates amid severe shortages of food, water, sanitation and medical care.",
      "Attorneys for other American citizens who were wrongfully detained have petitioned the U.N. for help in the recent past. They included\u00a0Baquer Namazi, who was permitted to leave Iran for life-saving surgery in the UAE in 2022, and Ryan Corbett, who was imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan and released in a prisoners swap in January 2025.",
      "\"Family is at the heart of the Iranian culture. This is why so many Iranian Americans travel back to Iran \u2014 to visit elderly parents and connect with extended family. Unfortunately, this respect for family is also what gives the regime a steady influx of dual nationals to feast on,\" Neda Sharghi, the sister of former wrongful detainee Emad Shargi and an advocate for American hostages and their families, told CBS News. (The siblings use slightly different spellings of their last name.)",
      "\"President Trump has witnessed the brutality of the Iranian regime. He also knows that we have innocent Americans, like recently detained Reza Valizadeh and Kamran Hekmati, among others, ensnared in the regime's hostage-taking tentacles. These Americans must come home and President Trump and his team have shown us that, at least when it comes to American hostages and wrongful detainees, they will do whatever they need to attain their freedom,\" Sharghi said.",
      "With help from Sharghi and Valizadeh's family, Fayhee has received since September three pre-recorded voice messages from Valizadeh describing the circumstances of his detention. The last came on Dec. 20.",
      "Neither Valizadeh nor his family have been in contact since Iran's crackdown and nationwide internet blackout began.",

    "summary": "Despite fears of Chinese spying and hacking, the British government gave the go-ahead for China to build a massive new embassy in the heart of London.",
    "story": [
      "London - Despite fears of Chinese spying and hacking, the British government gave the go-ahead Tuesday for China to build a massive new embassy in the heart of London. The mega-embassy's designs will see it occupy an entire city block with a view of The Shard, Britain's tallest building on the banks of the Thames.",
      "It will be China's biggest embassy in Europe.",
      "The U.K. government's decision ended a saga that began in 2018 with Beijing's purchase for nearly $350 million of the former Royal Mint building, which used to produce Britain's money and long served as a symbol of the U.K.'s economic might. After the COVID pandemic, the U.K. government \u2014 amid multiple changes in leadership \u2014 delayed final approval for the project as intelligence experts, members of the Chinese diaspora, and would-be future neighbors of the new embassy raised concerns and protested.",
      "The U.K. has approved plans for Beijing to establish a new embassy in London, which will be China's biggest embassy in all of Europe and take up an entire city block, despite concerns over espionage. CBS News' @RamyInocencio has more. pic.twitter.com/VfFozZY4Q2",
      "Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of the British foreign intelligence service MI6, previously called on the government to reject China's plans to build on the site, which sits on top of buried cables that transmit sensitive financial and commercial data across the U.K. capital.",
      "\"Having a Chinese embassy sitting on top of those cables, which could in extremis be attacked, is a significant problem,\" he told CBS News in early December, when a previous deadline for the government's decision was pushed to this month.",
      "With a larger physical presence, Beijing could also employ more Chinese diplomatic staff, who would have freedom of movement in Britain thanks to diplomatic visas.",
      "\"If it's got a very large embassy, there could be a very large number, and then going off to third countries, ostensibly on holiday or whatever, or to travel, and doing stuff outside the country to which they're accredited,\" said Dearlove.",
      "\"They're purporting to be ordinary diplomats, ordinary attaches, who are actually highly trained intelligence personnel,\" he said.",
      "U.K. officials respond to concerns about Chinese Embassy",
      "In response to intelligence concerns, the heads of the domestic intelligence agency MI5 and GCHQ, the intelligence, cyber and security agency, on Tuesday admitted that British national security risks tied to China's new embassy could not be totally eliminated and implied attempting to do so would be impossible.",
      "\"It would be irrational to drive 'embassy generated risk' down to zero when numerous other threat vectors are so central to the national security risks we face in the present era,\" GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler and MI5 Director-General Sir Ken McCallum said in a joint letter to government ministers. They also said that the work to mitigate risks had been \"expert, professional and proportionate.\"",
      "Separately, on political grounds, the 240-page report by the U.K. Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said decisions about embassy approval should not be decided based on a country's style of governance.",
      "\"Planning law and national and development plan policies, and for its signatories, the Vienna Convention which is founded on reciprocity, are nation-neutral,\" the report says. \"It is not possible to discriminate against a use on the basis of the anticipated user. Otherwise that could give rise to an untenable situation of the embassy of one nation being permitted but another nations embassy being refused.\"",
      "\"In this regard, any ethical or similar objection to the provision of an embassy for a specific country cannot be a material planning consideration,\" the report says. \"It would not be lawful to refuse permission simply because it would be for a Chinese Embassy \u2026 The same would hold for any other specific country seeking an embassy use through the planning system.\"",
      "Chinese Embassy's approval sparks criticism",
      "Despite the ministry's report, British opposition parties criticized approval of the embassy as an \"act of cowardice\" and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's \"biggest mistake yet.\"",
      "Anti-Beijing activist and dissident groups reacted with disappointment and anger. As China's government has cracked down on freedoms in Hong Kong, Tibet and China's Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang in its northwest, many sought refuge in the U.K.",
      "\"It is definitely deeply disappointing but not surprising,\" said Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician living in self-exile in London.",
      "She said she believed the U.K. approved the embassy so that Starmer could keep his planned trip to Beijing later this month. The U.K. has also been trying to get approval for a new embassy in Beijing.",
      "\"But to me it is a disproportionate deal,\" said Lau. \"China's economic favour / return to the UK isn't worth giving up on a huge chunk of national security concern.\"",
      "The U.K. has also become home to the world's largest Hong Kong diaspora community with an estimated nearly 200,000 having fled in the past five years after the failed mass democracy protests in 2019.",
      "\"(The) Hong Kong diaspora would definitely be affected,\" said Lau. \"I've heard people planning to relocate (into) secondary exile. The reason is that we have been seeing Chinese agents and the PRC (People's Republic of China) itself becoming bolder in reaching us in the UK.\"",
      "\"This embassy will be a daily reminder of China's increased presence, increased influence, over the UK government,\" said Tenzin Rabga Tashi of Tibetan advocacy group Free Tibet.",
      "\"It will be a reminder for my community members to watch how they behave, to not be as active in advocacy,\" Tashi said. \"You know, many of them have family inside Tibet so they won't be able to as freely be comfortable living in the UK knowing that China has more eyes on them, not just them but their friends, their families. This system of fear, this system of repression has increased in the UK and it will continue to expand as long as China's mega embassy is here.\"",
      "\"I am dismayed \u2026 absolutely furious,\" said Rahima Mahmut, executive director of human rights charity Stop Uyghur Genocide.",
      "Human rights groups say that, starting in 2014, up to a million Muslim Uyghur people were rounded up in Xinjiang and imprisoned. Those who could escaped, and thousands settled in the United States.",
      "\"The approval of the mega embassy is deeply dismaying and feels like a profound betrayal,\" Mahmut said.",
      "After the British government gave its approval, the Chinese Embassy in London said in a statement that it had noted that its application had been approved.",

      "It is the third time in less than one year that Mexico has sent detained cartel members to the U.S. as the country attempts to offset mounting threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. Garc\u00eda Harfuch said the government has sent 92 people in total.",
      "Garcia Harfuch said under an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, prosecutors would not seek the death penalty. He said the 37 individuals were taken to multiple cities, including Washington, Houston, New York, San Antonio and San Diego, aboard seven aircraft.",
      "Garcia Harfuch  posted images and video of the transfer on social media.",
      "The U.S. State Department and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment",
      "Tuesday's transfer included figures from the Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, a remnant of the infamous Zetas based in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, across from Texas. Mexican authorities said that all had pending U.S. cases.",

In August, a second round saw 26 Mexican cartel figures sent to the U.S. None had the profile of Caro Quintero, but spanning multiple cartels, the figures could help U.S. prosecutors build cases.",

    "story": [
      "Erbil, Iraq \u2014\u00a0CBS News found empty cells and abandoned orange jumpsuits on Monday inside a prison in northeast Syria that, until days ago, held suspected ISIS militants. The incident has highlighted lingering security concerns for Washington in the wake of Syria's brutal civil war.",
      "Syria's Interior Ministry accused the U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of allowing about 120 ISIS detainees to escape from the Al-Shaddadi prison \u2014 which is less than two miles from an American military base \u2014 during attempts by government forces to seize control of the facility.",
      "The SDF has denied allowing prisoners to flee, and the Syrian government later claimed that most of the escapees had been recaptured.",
      "U.S. concerns, and a changing relationship with the Kurdish SDF",
      "The SDF is an umbrella group of Kurdish forces that have held semiautonomous control over a significant area in northeast Syria for years. It proved to be a vital U.S. ally during the war against ISIS in Syria and neighboring Iraq.",
      "Clashes between Syria's relatively new post-war government \u2014 supported by some local tribes \u2014 and the SDF escalated last week in northeast Syria. The fighting follows two failed mediation attempts, led by U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Thomas Barrack.",
      "The U.S. alliance with the SDF dates to 2014, when ISIS seized nearly a third of Syria and Iraq. Backed by U.S. airstrikes and other assistance from Washington and its partners, SDF fighters played a decisive role in dismantling ISIS' self-declared Islamic State.",
      "Following the collapse of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024, the new Syrian government \u2014 led by Ahmad al-Shaara, a former Islamic militant who has since distanced himself from extremist groups \u2014 has managed to significantly improve relations with the U.S. He was even invited to visit the White House last year to meet Mr. Trump and, under his leadership, Syria has formally joined the Global Coalition against ISIS.",
      "Both the SDF and the Syrian government are now U.S. partners, but deep, lingering disagreements between those two entities over Syria's future governance and the SDF's control of territory in the country have boiled over into clashes recently.",
      "Making the complicated situation a potential risk for the U.S., the violence has flared up in Syria's Raqqa and al-Hasakah provinces, where there are multiple prisons holding thousands of ISIS fighters\u00a0\u2014 and also multiple bases used by American forces. A Pentagon official told CBS News in December that the U.S. had about 1,000 forces in Syria to counter ISIS.",
      "A U.S. military source confirmed to CBS News that there's a U.S. combat outpost near the al-Shaddadi prison, used largely for intelligence gathering and surveillance to protect American forces in the region.",
      "In a social media post on Tuesday, Ambassador Barrack said the emergence of the new government in Damascus had shifted \"the rationale for the US-SDF partnership: the original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps.\"",
      "He urged the SDF to work with the government in Damascus and embrace \"a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation \u2014 long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime, where many Kurds faced statelessness, language restrictions, and systemic discrimination.\"",
      "Barrack said the U.S. government remained focused on \"ensuring the security of prison facilities holding ISIS prisoners, currently guarded by the SDF,\" as well as facilitating talks between the SDF and the Syrian government to ensure \"peaceful integration of the SDF and the political inclusion of Syria's Kurdish population into a historic full Syrian citizenship.\"",
      "Rapidly changing control of thousands of ISIS prisoners and family members",
      "Attacks by pro-government forces on SDF positions near the Al-Aqtan Prison in Raqqa, which holds nearly 1,000 ISIS detainees, have fueled concerns about a potential mass escape in recent days. The SDF claimed in a social media post on Tuesday that government forces were again attacking the prison with exploding drones and heavy gunfire.",
      "SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami told CBS News the situation at al-Qatna was \"extremely dangerous\" and said if the government forces breached the facility, ISIS detainees could escape as they did at al-Shaddadi.",
      "The greatest concern, however, is over the Ghwayran Prison in al-Hasakah, where thousands of hardened ISIS inmates are still being held. Over the past six years, Ghwayran has faced multiple riots and coordinated ISIS attacks aimed at freeing imprisoned members.",
      "Shami said the situation at the prison was secure despite attack attempts by local ISIS sleeper cells on Tuesday. He said, however, that pro-government forces were massing about 15 miles south and east of the city of al-Hasakah, in preparation for a potential assault.",
      "Beyond the prisons, fighting also reached the sprawling al-Hol refugee camp in al-Hasakah. The camp, long guarded by the SDF, has housed over 40,000 displaced people for a decade. Among them are the family members of detained and killed ISIS militants, many of them highly radicalized themselves and still loyal to the group.",
      "Videos posted online showed pro-Syrian government forces entering the facility, and the Syria Interior Ministry said in a social media post that government forces had \"begun securing the situation in Al-Hol camp\" after the the withdrawal of the SDF, which it said had left \"the camp without any guards, in an attempt to create chaos and allow those in the camp to escape.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says the U.K. decision to hand a strategic island to Mauritius, which he previously supported, was stupid, and justification for his attempt to acquire Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump has called the U.K.'s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius \u2014 a deal his administration previously supported \u2014 an act of \"great stupidity\" that further justified his desire for the U.S. to acquire Greenland. One of the islands, Diego Garcia, is the site of a key U.K.-U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean.",
      "\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Mr. Trump said early Tuesday on his own Truth Social platform. \"There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before. The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired. Denmark and its European Allies have to DO THE RIGHT THING. Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",
      "Mr. Trump issued his statement as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson, a Republican, was in the U.K. to address the British parliament, where he told lawmakers the U.S. and U.K. had \"always been able to work through our differences calmly as friends. We will continue to do that. I want to assure you this morning that that is still the case.\"",
      "The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius, which was then a British colony, in 1965.",
      "The U.K. purchased the islands for the equivalent of around $4 million, CBS News partner BBC News reported, but Mauritius had long argued that it was forced to give the islands away in order to achieve its independence in 1968. The U.K. invited the U.S. to build a military base on the island of Diego Garcia, and it has become a cornerstone of American defense infrastructure in the vast Indian Ocean region.",
      "In 2019, the International Court of Justice issued a non-binding ruling that called on the U.K. to give up control of the Chagos Islands, saying it had wrongfully forced out the people living on Diego Garcia to make way for the military base.",
      "That ruling, in part, prompted the deal reached in 2024 for the U.K. to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. As part of the agreement, Britain got to maintain control of the military base on Diego Garcia through a 99-year lease, at a cost to the U.K. of about $136 million per year.",
      "The Trump administration previously supported the Chagos Islands deal, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio issuing a statement in May last year saying, \"following a comprehensive interagency review, the Trump Administration determined that this agreement secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"",
      "Rubio said at the time that Mr. Trump had \"expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer at the White House,\" calling the base \"a critical asset for regional and global security.\"",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Tuesday, a U.K. government spokesperson said Britain \"will never compromise on our national security,\" noting that the agreement with Mauritius was struck \"because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future.\"",
      "\"This deal secures the operations of the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out,\" the British government said, noting that it had previously been \"publicly welcomed by the U.S., Australia and all other Five Eyes allies, as well as key international partners including India, Japan and South Korea.\"",

      "After President Donald Trump took to the World Economic Forum stage in Davos to declare that Western civilization must defend itself from an existential attack, Somali-born activist and author Ayaan Hirsi Ali said \"Trump is right.\"",
      "Trump shocked other politicians and leaders gathered in Switzerland Tuesday night by declaring, \"The West cannot mass import foreign cultures.\"",
      "\"The situation in Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot mass import foreign cultures which have failed to ever build a successful society of their own,\" he said. \"We're taking people from Somalia, and Somalia is a failed [state]. It's not a nation, got no government, got no police, got no military, got no nothing.",

      "As a child in Somalia, Hirsi Ali was subjected to a severe form of female genital mutilation. Later in life, she fled the country to escape a forced marriage and served as a Dutch lawmaker. She is now based in the U.S. and uses her platform to advocate for women\u2019s rights, critique Islam and voice support for Western greatness.",

      "\"The economy is very important. Military is very important. All these other aspects of government are extremely important, but more important than all of that is our value system. And it's our heritage. And it is our national identity.\"",

We've had all the bad ideologies, and, as Somalis, we've run away with them.\"",
      "Further, Hirsi Ali said the situation in Minnesota exposes a \"subversive agenda in the United States to transform it and to Islamize it using American institutions and the American vocabulary of civil rights.\"",
      "\"You see that the Somalis exploit and extract the benefit system,\" she said. \"They tell everyone, 'If you expose this, investigate it, object to it, stop it, you're racist. You're an Islamophobe. You are a bigot.",
      "\"If we keep on doing what we are doing, getting huge numbers of people from the Third World to come and establish themselves in the United States and European countries and depend on welfare benefits, that is to take and take and never contribute, then we're setting ourselves up not only for failure. We're committing a cultural and national and political suicide.\"",
      "To combat this, Hirsi Ali said European nations must follow the Trump administration\u2019s example in sealing their borders. She said the U.S. and Europe must also address their broad welfare systems, which she said are \"just too expensive.\"",

      "The committee voted 34-9 to advance one contempt recommendation against Bill Clinton, with two members voting present, and another on Hillary Clinton in a 28-15 vote, with one member voting present. Nine Democrats voted with Republicans to advance contempt recommendations against Bill Clinton and three Democrats joined Republicans in the vote against Hillary Clinton.",

      "Republicans on the committee contend that by not appearing before lawmakers, the Clintons impeded congressional investigations into Epstein and his activities. Bill and Hillary Clinton originally received subpoenas to appear before lawmakers on Oct. 14 and Oct. 9, 2025, respectively, to answer questions on Epstein\u2019s dealings, but even after working with the committee to reschedule, they did not appear for questioning.",
      "COMER RIPS 'PAID DISRUPTOR' AS BRIEFING ON CLINTON CONTEMPT PUSH DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS",
      "An attorney for the Clintons wrote to the committee, calling the subpoenas \"invalid and legally unenforceable\" and claiming they lacked a connection to a legislative purpose.",
      "Instead, the Clintons offered Comer the opportunity to travel to New York to conduct an interview by himself without an official transcript.",
      "Comer rejected the offer, calling it \"insulting.\"",
      "\"The Clintons\u2019 latest demands make clear they believe their last name entitles them to special treatment,\" Comer said in a statement. \"The House Oversight Committee rejects the Clintons\u2019 unreasonable demands and will move forward with contempt resolutions.\"",

      "Rep. Emily Randall, D-Wash., said she would not defend the Clintons but framed the contempt recommendations as an extension of Trump\u2019s political objectives.",
      "\"I do not feel it is my responsibility to defend the former President of the United States as a member of Congress, in a separate and co-equal branch of government \u2014 just like it is not your responsibility, Mr. Chair, to carry out the political retribution of the current president,\" Randall said.",

      "The Supreme Court appeared poised to give President Donald Trump one of his biggest legal setbacks in office, offering strong support Wednesday for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook remaining in her leadership position -- at least for now.",
      "The justices debated in their packed courtroom whether Trump has broad unilateral executive authority to fire someone from the central bank, despite its special status as a stand-alone federal agency.",
      "During nearly two hours of oral arguments, a majority seemed to agree the Fed's unique public-private hybrid structure limited removal without clear \"cause,\" and that Trump did not meet his legal obligations when seeking Cook's dismissal for alleged private mortgage fraud.",

      "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and attorney Abbe Lowell, arrive at the Supreme Court in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo)",
      "The case comes before the Supreme Court on an emergency basis -- with the government seeking to dismiss Cook now, for as long as the courts decide the matter, a process that could last months.",
      "The justices could decide the larger constitutional questions now or give the lower federal courts a chance for a full examination of the facts, with some guidance from the high court on the standards of \"for cause\" removal.",
      "In arguments, most on the court seemed skeptical of Trump's actions.",
      "\"That's your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available?\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer. \"Very low bar for cause that the president alone determines. And that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Let's talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me just thinking big picture, what goes around, comes around,\" added Kavanaugh, who has typically been an ardent defender of executive power. \"All the current president's appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20th, 2029 -- if there's a Democratic president or January 20th, 2033. And then, we're really at, at will removal.\"",
      "Others on the bench raised questions of \"public confidence\" if the president could fire Fed governors without fully explaining or justifying the reasons.",
      "\"We have amicus briefs from economists who tell us that if Governor Cook is\" fired, asked Justice Amy Coney Barrett, \"that it can trigger a recession. How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?\"",
      "Cook's lawyer told the nine-member bench court the Federal Reserve System was created by Congress in 1913 as a wholly independent entity, to insulate it from political influence, and from any one president \"stacking the deck\" with their own nominees.",

      "With Cook in the audience as a show of support was Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has also sought to remove in a broader, ongoing feud with the agency over the pace of lowering benchmark interest rates to spur the domestic economy.",
      "But the Trump Justice Department said he had executive authority to seek Cook's removal, free from judicial review.",
      "The conservative court has allowed much of Trump's challenged executive actions to be enforced at least temporarily -- including upholding firings of members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission, despite federal laws protecting them against removal without good cause.",
      "The justices last month heard arguments in a separate case, on Trump's efforts to remove Democrat-appointed Rebecca Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which, like the Fed, is a congressionally-created independent, multi-member regulatory agency.",
      "The 6-3 conservative majority in that petition appeared ready to rule for the president when it involves semi-autonomous agencies like the FTC.",
      "But in the Federal Reserve dispute, the high court clearly indicated this institution was different.",
      "In the Cook case, lower courts ruled she did not receive due process when the president tried to fire her.",
      "The current posture of the case is whether Trump can remove Cook -- at least temporarily -- while the dispute continues to play out on the merits.",
      "The \"for cause\" removal restriction's constitutionality is not directly before the justices, but nevertheless played a key role in the oral argument session.",
      "The Supreme Court could go ahead and settle the competing issues now -- which seems unlikely -- or leave it to the lower courts to continue hearing the appeal, with guidance on how to proceed.",
      "Though its leaders are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the seven-member board is considered an independent government agency, since its monetary policy decisions do not need presidential or legislative approval. But the agency does provide Congress with regular reports on its work.",

      "Gorsuch asked if the president could just call Cook into the White House Roosevelt Room. \"So just a meeting across a conference table, finish with 'you're fired?'\"",
      "But Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly said a hearing on the allegations would serve little use if her only defense is she made an \"inadvertent error\" on her mortgage application.",
      "The public session also focused extensively on the standards of \"cause\" that would permit Cook's dismissal. Several justices suggested the mortgage fraud claims against Cook were not serious enough to trigger emergency action requested by the government to remove her at least temporarily.",
      "Existing statutory removal protections include the so-called \"INM standard\" -- \"inefficiency, neglect of malfeasance.\"",
      "\"The question becomes, is it grossly negligent to make a mistake on a mortgage application?\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito also asked why the case was handled \"in such a hurried manner,\" suggesting concern the allegations against Cook have not been properly adjudicated, either by the courts or by the president himself.",
      "In a statement after the hearing ended, Cook said her case is \"about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) says the president can only remove members of the Fed board and FOMC \"for cause.\" The exact parameters of that standard were not spelled out in the original law, and never fully tested in the courts.",

      "A new mobile app from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called \"Are You Dead?\" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.",

      "How the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app works",
      "The app's design is intentionally simple. After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.",
      "Here is how it works in practice:",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OKIf they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third dayThe alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",

      "If they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third day",
      "The alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "That is it. No tracking. No health data. No constant monitoring. The goal is reassurance, not surveillance. On its English-language page, the app goes by the name Demumu. The developers describe it as a \"lightweight safety tool\" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on Apple's App Store for iPhone and iPad.",
      "Why the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app went viral in China",
      "The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.",
      "Why users say the app provides peace of mind",
      "For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.",

      "The name of the app sparks debate",
      "Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it \"Are You Alive?\" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for the app if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.",
      "What the developers of the app plan next",
      "The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.",

      "Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.",
      "Loneliness is not just a problem in China",
      "The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.",

      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning about a growing cyber threat that turns everyday QR codes into spying tools.",
      "According to the bureau, a North Korean government-sponsored hacking group is using a tactic known as quishing to target people in the United States.",
      "The goal is simple. Trick you into scanning a QR code that sends you to a malicious website. From there, attackers can steal login credentials, install malware or quietly collect device data.",

      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "The FBI is warning Americans about a growing cyber threat that uses QR codes to steal data and spy on victims, tying the attacks to a North Korean hacking group. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "What quishing is and why it works",
      "Quishing is short for QR code phishing. Instead of clicking a suspicious link in an email, the victim scans a QR code that hides the real destination. QR codes themselves are harmless. The danger lies in the link embedded inside them. Once scanned, the link can redirect users to fake login pages, malware downloads or tracking sites. Because QR codes feel familiar and fast, many people scan them without thinking twice. That split second of trust is exactly what attackers rely on.",
      "Who is behind the attacks",
      "The FBI says the activity is tied to a hacking group known as Kimsuky. The group has operated for years as a cyber espionage arm for North Korea. What is new is the delivery method. According to the FBI, the QR code-based attacks began in May 2025. In one example, attackers posed as a foreign policy advisor and emailed a think tank leader with a QR code that linked to a fake questionnaire. Scanning the code sent the victim to a malicious site designed to harvest information.",
      "What happens after you scan the QR code",
      "Once a victim lands on one of these sites, several things can happen. Some pages prompt users to download files that contain malware. Others mimic mobile login portals for popular services such as Okta, Microsoft 365 or VPN services. Even if no form is filled out, the site can still collect device details. That includes IP address, operating system, browser type and approximate location. Over time, that data helps attackers build intelligence profiles on their targets.",
      "Why QR code phishing attacks are highly targeted",
      "The FBI describes these campaigns as spear phishing rather than mass spam. That means the emails are crafted for specific individuals. The language context and sender details are tailored to look relevant and credible. When an email feels personal, people are more likely to trust it. That is why these attacks are especially dangerous for professionals, researchers, executives and anyone working in policy or technology.",
      "Why QR code phishing threats are growing",
      "QR codes are everywhere now. Restaurants, parking meters, event tickets and ads all rely on them. As their use grows, so does the opportunity for abuse. Attackers know people are conditioned to scan without hesitation. That makes caution more important than ever.",
      "Ways to stay safe from QR code phishing",
      "The FBI says one of the best defenses against quishing is slowing down. QR codes remove the visual clues people rely on, so a few extra checks can make a big difference.",
      "Treat QR codes like links in emails. If you did not expect it, do not scan it. QR codes sent by email, text or messaging apps are a common entry point for quishing attacks. Criminals rely on curiosity and urgency to push you into scanning without thinking.",
      "Always confirm who sent the QR code. If a message claims to come from a coworker, vendor or organization, reach out through a separate channel before scanning. A quick call or direct message can stop a phishing attempt cold.",

      "Federal investigators say hackers are using \"quishing,\" or QR code phishing, to lure victims to malicious websites that steal credentials and device data. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)",
      "QR code phishing often leads to fake mobile login pages. Attackers mimic sign-in screens for email, VPNs and cloud services to steal usernames and passwords. If a QR code takes you to a login page, close it and visit the site manually instead.",
      "Once a QR code opens a page, check the address bar. Look for misspellings, extra words or unfamiliar domain endings. A strange URL is often the only warning sign that the site is malicious.",
      "Strong antivirus software adds an extra layer of protection against quishing. Security tools can block known phishing sites, stop malicious downloads and warn you before harmful pages load. This is especially important on mobile devices, where QR codes are most often scanned.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some quishing sites collect device and location data even if you do nothing. A data removal service helps reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. That makes it harder for attackers to target you with convincing spear phishing emails that include QR codes.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Illinois residents are once again being reminded how fragile government data systems can be. The Illinois Department of Human Services has confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records belonging to roughly 700,000 people.",
      "The breach is believed to have exposed two distinct sets of records. One is personal and program-related data tied to more than 672,000 Medicaid and Medicare Savings Program recipients, including addresses, case numbers, demographic details and medical assistance plan names, and another 32,000 Division of Rehabilitation Services customers whose names, addresses, case details and referral information were also exposed over multiple years.",

      "The Illinois Department of Human Services confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records tied to roughly 700,000 residents, including Medicaid and disability services recipients. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "What happened in the Illinois DHS data breach",
      "As spotted by Bleeping Computer, the Illinois Department of Human Services disclosed that unauthorized access to one of its systems led to the exposure of records tied to approximately 700,000 Illinois residents. The affected data was connected to individuals who interacted with DHS programs, which can include benefits, assistance services and support programs across the state.",
      "According to the agency, the breach involved personally identifiable information. While officials have not publicly released every technical detail, DHS confirmed that sensitive records were accessed, prompting notifications to impacted individuals. As is typical in cases like this, the investigation is ongoing, and the full scope of how the intrusion occurred is still being reviewed.",
      "For residents, the key issue is not just that data was accessed, but the type of data DHS holds. Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.",
      "Why breaches like this are especially risky",
      "When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.",
      "Exposed records can be used for identity theft, fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.",
      "As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.",

These services can alert you to suspicious activity involving your Social Security number or credit file before the damage spreads. Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "The approval comes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and marks a major shift in how mental health conditions may be treated. The newly approved device is called FL-100, and it comes from Flow Neuroscience.",
      "It is designed for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Clinicians can prescribe it as a stand-alone treatment or alongside antidepressants and therapy.

      "Flow Neuroscience has gotten approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its FL-100 prescription brain-stimulation device. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "How the Flow FL-100 works",
      "The FL-100 uses transcranial direct current stimulation, often shortened to tDCS. This technology delivers a gentle electrical current to the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain tied to mood regulation and stress response. In many people with depression, activity in this area is reduced. By stimulating it, the device aims to restore healthier brain signaling over time. The system looks like a lightweight headset and pairs with a mobile app. Patients use it at home for about 30 minutes per day while clinicians monitor progress remotely.",
      "The clinical results behind the approval",
      "The FDA based its decision on a randomized controlled trial that evaluated home use under remote supervision. Participants who received active stimulation showed meaningful improvement on clinician-rated and self-reported depression scales. After 10 weeks of treatment, patients experienced an average symptom improvement of 58% compared to a control group. Many users reported noticeable changes within the first three weeks. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine, adding credibility to the findings. Side effects were generally mild and short-term. Reported issues included skin irritation, redness, headaches, and brief stinging sensations at the electrode sites.",

      "A growing shift toward tech-based mental health care",
      "Flow's device has already been used by more than 55,000 people across Europe, the U.K., Switzerland and Hong Kong. In the U.K., it is prescribed within parts of the public health system. Company leaders say the U.S. approval opens the door for broader access to non-drug treatment options. The momentum is not isolated. In 2025, researchers at UCLA Health developed another experimental brain-stimulation approach, signaling rapid growth in this field. Together, these advances suggest that at-home neuromodulation may soon become a standard part of depression care rather than a fringe option.",
      "When will the device be available",
      "Flow expects the FL-100 to be available to U.S. patients in the second quarter of 2026. A prescription will be required, and the companion app will be available on iOS and Android. The company also plans to explore additional uses for its platform, including sleep disorders, addiction, and traumatic brain injury.",

      "What to know before trying Flow",
      "Flow is FDA approved for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and it requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Doctors can recommend it on its own or alongside medication or therapy. The headset is non-invasive and designed for home use, but it is not meant for emergency situations or people considered treatment resistant. It also does not replace crisis care or immediate mental health support. Most users wear the headset for about 30 minutes per session. Mild tingling, warmth, skin irritation or headaches can happen, especially early on. These effects are usually short-lived and monitored by a clinician through the companion app.",
      "Flow pairs with a mobile app that guides treatment and supports remote clinical oversight. Your provider sets the treatment plan, and the device follows prescribed settings to ensure safe use. Pricing and insurance coverage may vary once the device becomes available in the U.S. Some patients may access Flow through clinics, research programs, or as it becomes more widely adopted in routine depression care. The bottom line is simple. Flow adds another evidence-based option, not a cure and not a one-size-fits-all solution. For people who have struggled to find relief, having another clinically proven choice can matter a lot.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you care about struggles with depression, this approval expands the range of real treatment options. It offers a non-drug path that can be used at home under medical guidance. For patients who have not responded well to medication or who experience unwanted side effects, this could provide another way forward. It also reflects a broader trend toward personalized, tech-enabled mental healthcare.",

That matters for people who have tried medications, dealt with side effects or felt stuck with limited options. This device will not be the right answer for everyone, but it gives patients and doctors one more proven tool to work with. And for many people living with depression, having another option could make all the difference.",

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices following a 'massive security gap.'",
      "The Apple iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the United States and one of the most widely used devices in the world. An estimated 1.6 billion people rely on iPhones every day. That massive user base also makes the platform a prime target.",
      "Over the past few weeks, Apple has been sending out warnings about a serious security flaw. New data suggests the risk could affect roughly half of all iPhone users.",

      "Apple is warning iPhone users about a serious Safari security flaw that could leave hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable if updates are delayed. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "What Apple discovered in Safari and WebKit",
      "Late last month, Apple confirmed two critical vulnerabilities in WebKit. WebKit powers Safari and every browser that runs on iOS. According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code. Once that happens, attackers could gain control of the device, steal passwords or access payment information. In simple terms, visiting the wrong website could have been enough.",
      "Why millions of iPhones are still exposed",
      "Apple moved quickly to release a fix. The patch is included in the latest software update. The problem is that many people have not installed it yet. Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide. Data from StatCounter paints an even worse picture. It estimates that only 20 percent of users have updated so far. Once security details become public, the risk grows fast. Attackers know exactly what to exploit.",
      "iPhone and iPad models at the highest risk",

      "Why upgrading is the only real protection",
      "There is no setting to flip and no safe browsing habit that fixes this issue. The vulnerability lives deep inside the browser engine. Security experts say there is no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully reduces the risk. Installing the latest software is the only effective defense. Apple is no longer offering a security-only update for users who want to stay on iOS 18. Unless your device cannot run iOS 26, the fix is only available through iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2.",

      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software",
      "Keeping your iPhone updated is critical, but it should not be your only line of defense. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by scanning malicious links, blocking risky websites and alerting you to suspicious activity before damage is done.",
      "This matters even more when attacks rely on compromised websites or hidden browser exploits. Security software can help catch threats that slip through and give you extra visibility into what is happening on your device.",

      "Alexa.com\u00a0is the browser-based version of Alexa+. You can type questions, explore topics, plan trips, organize tasks, or create content without touching a smart speaker.

      "So far, there has been no public notice on Brightspeed's website or social media channels confirming customer data exposure.",
      "Who Brightspeed is and why this matters",
      "Brightspeed is a U.S. telecommunications and internet service provider founded in 2022 after Apollo Global Management acquired local exchange assets from Lumen Technologies.",
      "Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company serves rural and suburban communities across 20 states. It has rapidly expanded its fiber footprint, passing more than 2 million homes and businesses and aiming to reach over 5 million locations.",

      "What this could mean for customers",
      "Even though Brightspeed has not confirmed a breach, the claims alone are enough to raise red flags. If customer data was accessed, it could be used for phishing scams, account takeovers or payment fraud.",

    "summary": "The Rictor X4 electric aircraft promises personal flight for $39,900, making eVTOL technology accessible with 50 mph speeds and truck-bed portability.",
    "story": [
      "A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.",
      "Personal electric aircraft have teased us for years. They look futuristic, promise freedom from traffic, and usually come with prices that put them out of reach or timelines that feel uncertain. Recently unveiled at CES 2026, the Rictor X4 entered that conversation with some bold claims.",
      "It is a single-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed to make short-range personal flight more accessible and far more affordable. If those promises hold up, it could change how we think about flying for everyday trips.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "CES 2026 put health tech front and center, with companies showcasing smarter ways to support prevention, mobility and long-term wellness. (CES)",
      "TECH STARTUP, MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNER TO LAUNCH ELECTRIC AIR TAXI SERVICE",
      "What the Rictor X4 actually is",
      "The Rictor X4 uses a multirotor design with eight propellers spread across four carbon fiber arms. Those arms fold inward when the aircraft is not in use, allowing it to fit in the bed of a pickup truck. The aircraft focuses on low-altitude flight and short hops rather than long journeys.",
      "Key specs include:",
      "Top speed of about 50 mphMaximum flight time of 20 minutesPayload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "Top speed of about 50 mph",
      "Maximum flight time of 20 minutes",
      "Payload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "It can lift off and land vertically like a helicopter, then transition into forward flight once airborne. Rictor describes its mission as light aerial mobility, which essentially means short-distance commuting and professional applications.",
      "Inside the X4's propulsion and power system",
      "According to Rictor, the X4's propulsion system is built around stability and redundancy rather than raw speed. Each axis uses a coaxial dual-motor configuration designed to provide consistent thrust during low-altitude flight.",
      "Key propulsion details include:",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axisPeak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axisMaximum continuous power output of 10 kW120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axis",
      "Peak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axis",
      "Maximum continuous power output of 10 kW",
      "120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Together, these systems aim to deliver controlled, predictable flight with built-in safety margins, especially during takeoff, landing and hover.",
      "The Rictor X4 is a single-passenger electric aircraft designed for short-range, low-altitude flight with a folding multirotor layout. (Rictor)",
      "Safety systems and flight control in the Rictor X4",
      "Rictor puts safety at the center of the X4's design. The aircraft uses a semi-solid state battery system with dual battery redundancy, which helps enable a controlled landing if one battery module fails. In addition, an emergency parachute system provides backup protection during critical situations. At the same time, a centralized flight control system actively manages propulsion, attitude and overall system health. This system continuously monitors key flight data to help maintain stability in changing conditions.",
      "Beyond software, the hardware plays an important role. The X4 features 63-inch carbon fiber folding propellers in a 4-axis, 8-propeller configuration. Together, they support a payload of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot. According to Rictor, the aircraft is designed to operate at noise levels below 65 decibels, although independent testing has not yet been published. Finally, Rictor's proprietary Dynamic Balance Algorithm adjusts the output of all eight motors in real time. As a result, the X4 can maintain a stable hover even in side winds rated up to Level 6.",
      "The FAA rule that could make personal flight easier",
      "One of Rictor's most attention-grabbing claims involves regulation. The company says the X4 is designed to comply with FAA Part 103, which governs ultralight vehicles in the U.S. If operated within Part 103 limits, the X4 could be flown legally without airworthiness certification or a pilot's license. Rictor says this is enabled by autonomous pre-programmed flight paths and very low altitude operation, reportedly as low as three meters above ground. It is worth noting that Part 103 still carries operational restrictions, including where and how flight can occur. Final compliance depends on real-world use and FAA interpretation.",
      "Designed to fold, transport, and recharge",
      "Portability is a major focus. Rictor says the X4 folds down to about 42 cubic feet, which makes it compact enough to transport in the bed of a pickup truck. The company also highlights in-vehicle charging support while parked or on the move, positioning the X4 as something that can be transported and recharged alongside ground vehicles rather than stored at an airfield.",
      "AIR TAXI SERVICE PLANS EVTOL RIDES FROM ALL THREE NYC AIRPORTS",
      "The price that resets expectations",
      "The Rictor X4 carries a launch price of $39,900 with a $5,000 deposit. That alone separates it from most personal eVTOLs currently discussed in the market. The aircraft is produced by Kuickwheel Technology, Rictor's parent company. According to the company, first customer deliveries are scheduled for Q2 2026. As with any aircraft launch, timelines remain aspirational until production units reach customers.",
      "Why this matters now",
      "Personal eVTOLs have lived in a narrow space between concept and reality. High costs, regulatory hurdles and safety concerns have slowed adoption. If Rictor delivers an aircraft that performs as described while operating within ultralight rules, it could expand personal flight beyond niche enthusiasts and into practical short-range use. Now it comes down to whether the company can deliver on what it's promising.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Rictor X4 brings together aggressive pricing, compact design and regulatory positioning in a way we have not seen before. Folding propellers, redundant safety systems and Part 103 alignment make it one of the most ambitious personal eVTOL launches to date. The unanswered questions center on real-world performance, regulatory interpretation and production readiness. Until aircraft are flying outside controlled demonstrations, healthy skepticism remains warranted. Still, this is one of the most compelling personal flight announcements to come out of CES in recent years.",

      "A new malware campaign is turning WhatsApp Web into a weapon. Security researchers say a banking Trojan linked to Astaroth is now spreading automatically through chat messages, making the attack harder to stop once it starts.",
      "The campaign is known as Boto Cor-de-Rosa. It shows how cybercriminals keep evolving, especially when they can abuse tools people trust every day. This attack focuses on Windows users and uses WhatsApp Web as both the delivery system and the engine that spreads the infection further.",

      "BROWSER EXTENSION MALWARE INFECTED 8.8M USERS IN DARKSPECTRE ATTACK",
      "Attackers abuse the WhatsApp Web to spread malware through messages that appear to come from people you trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this WhatsApp Web attack works",
      "The attack starts with a simple message. A contact sends what looks like a routine ZIP file through WhatsApp. The file name appears random and harmless, which lowers suspicion. Once opened, the ZIP contains a Visual Basic script disguised as a normal document. If the user runs it, the script quietly pulls in two more pieces of malware. Then the script downloads the Astaroth banking malware written in Delphi. It also installs a Python-based module designed to control WhatsApp Web. Both components run in the background without obvious warning signs. From there, the infection becomes self-sustaining.",
      "Malware that spreads itself through your contacts",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is how it propagates. The Python module scans the victim's WhatsApp contacts and sends the malicious ZIP file to every conversation automatically. Researchers at Acronis found that the malware adapts its messages based on the time of day. It sends friendly greetings, making the message feel normal and familiar. The text says, \"Here is the requested file. If you have any questions, I'm available!\" Because the message appears to come from someone you know, many people open it without hesitation.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "A single ZIP file sent through chat can quietly install banking malware and begin spreading to every contact. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Built-in tracking keeps the attack efficient",
      "This malware is carefully designed to monitor its own performance in real time. The propagation tool tracks how many messages are successfully delivered, how many fail to send and the overall sending speed measured per minute. After every 50 messages, it generates progress updates that show how many contacts have been reached. This feedback allows attackers to measure success quickly and make adjustments if something stops working.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "The initial script is heavily obfuscated to avoid detection by antivirus tools. Once it runs, it launches PowerShell commands that download more malware from compromised websites. One known domain used in this campaign is coffe-estilo.com. The malware installs itself inside a folder that mimics a Microsoft Edge cache directory. Inside are executable files and libraries that make up the full Astaroth banking payload. From there, the malware can steal credentials, monitor activity and potentially access financial accounts.",
      "Why WhatsApp Web is being abused",
      "WhatsApp Web is popular because it mirrors your phone conversations on a computer. That convenience makes it easy to send messages, share files and type faster, but it also introduces risk. When you use WhatsApp Web, you link your phone to a browser by scanning a QR code at web.whatsapp.com. Once connected, that browser session becomes a trusted extension of your account. Your chats appear on the screen, messages you send come from your real number and incoming messages sync across both devices.",
      "That setup is exactly what attackers take advantage of. If malware gains access to a computer with WhatsApp Web logged in, it can act as the user. It can read messages, access contact lists and send files or links that look completely legitimate. The messages do not raise alarms because they are coming from a real account, not a fake one.",
      "This is what turns WhatsApp Web into an effective delivery system for malware. Instead of breaking into WhatsApp itself, attackers simply abuse an open browser session to spread malicious files automatically.",
      "Many users do not realize the danger because WhatsApp Web feels harmless. It is often left signed in on work computers, shared devices or systems without strong security. In those situations, malware does not need advanced tricks. It only needs access to an already trusted session. That combination of convenience and trust is why WhatsApp Web has become such an attractive target.",
      "MALICIOUS MAC EXTENSIONS STEAL CRYPTO WALLETS AND PASSWORDS",
      "Once the WhatsApp Web is compromised, malware can act like the user, sending messages and files that look completely legitimate.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from WhatsApp Web malware",
      "Attacks like this WhatsApp Web malware are designed to spread fast through trusted conversations. A few smart habits can dramatically lower your risk.",
      "Messaging apps feel casual, which is exactly why attackers use them. Never open ZIP files sent through chat unless you confirm with the sender first. Watch for file names made of random numbers or unfamiliar names.\u00a0Treat messages that create urgency or feel overly familiar as a warning sign. If a file arrives out of nowhere, pause before clicking.",
      "This campaign abuses WhatsApp Web to spread automatically once a device is infected. Check active WhatsApp Web sessions and log out of any you do not recognize. Avoid leaving WhatsApp Web signed in on shared or public computers. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) inside WhatsApp settings. Cutting off Web access helps limit how far malware can travel.",
      "This type of malware takes advantage of systems that fall behind on updates. Install Windows updates as soon as they are available. Also, keep your web browser fully updated. Staying current closes many of the doors attackers try to slip through. In addition, use strong antivirus software that watches for script abuse and PowerShell activity in real time.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Banking malware often pairs with identity theft and financial fraud. One way to reduce the fallout is by shrinking your digital footprint. A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites that attackers often search.

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Most malware infections happen because people act too quickly. If a message feels off, trust that instinct. Familiar names and friendly language can lower your guard, but they should never replace caution. Take a moment to verify the message or file before opening anything. Attackers rely on trust and urgency to succeed. Slowing down takes away their advantage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This WhatsApp Web malware campaign is a reminder that cyberattacks no longer rely on obvious red flags. Instead, they blend into everyday conversations and use familiar tools to spread quietly and quickly. What makes this threat especially concerning is how little effort it takes for it to move from one device to dozens of others.",
      "A single click can turn a trusted chat into a delivery system for banking malware and identity theft. The good news is that small changes make a big difference. Paying attention to attachments, locking down WhatsApp Web access, keeping devices updated and slowing down before clicking can stop these attacks cold. As messaging platforms continue to play a bigger role in daily life, staying alert is no longer optional. Awareness and simple habits remain some of the strongest defenses you have.",

      "The device measures volatile organic compounds, especially acetone, which has long been associated with rising blood glucose. That sweet fruity breath is a known marker of diabetes. By detecting changes in those compounds, isaac can alert users to potential glucose events. The device is small, about the size of a quarter, with a loop so it can be worn on a lanyard or clipped to clothing or a bag.",
      "The breath-based design is intended to reduce how often users need finger-prick blood tests, while providing early alerts for glucose-related changes.",
      "The device is named after the inventor's grandson, Isaac, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at just 2 years old. The inventor, Bud Wilcox, wanted to reduce the number of painful finger pricks his grandson faced each day. That personal motivation led to years of collaboration with scientists, designers and engineers. Research and development included work with Indiana University under the direction of Dr. M. Agarwal. The goal was simple but ambitious: Alert families to blood sugar events earlier while reducing the physical and emotional toll of constant testing.",
      "How the isaac device fits into daily life",

      "PreEvnt first introduced isaac publicly at CES 2025. Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials.\u00a0Those studies compare isaac's breath-based alerts with traditional blood glucose monitoring methods.",
      "Trials began with adolescents who have Type 1 diabetes and later expanded to adults with Type 2 diabetes. The company is now working toward regulatory review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Because this technology is new, PreEvnt is pursuing a de novo pathway, which allows devices to be evaluated while standards are still being defined. According to the company, regulators have shown strong interest as the data continues to come in.",

      "Every January, I hear from people who say the same thing: \"I just got an email that looked official, and I almost fell for it.\" That's not a coincidence. January is one of the busiest months of the year for scammers. While most of us are focused on taxes, benefits, subscriptions, and getting our finances in order, criminals are doing their own kind of cleanup, refreshing scam lists and going after people with newly updated personal data. If you've ever received a message claiming your account needs to be \"verified,\" your benefits are at risk, or your tax information is incomplete, this article is for you.",

      "Scam messages often look urgent and official, pushing you to act before you have time to think. That pressure is exactly what criminals rely on. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why January is prime time for scammers",
      "January is when scammers have everything they need.\u00a0According to YouMail's Robocall Index, U.S. consumers received just over 4.7 billion robocalls in January 2025, a roughly 9% increase from December 2024. This year, we can expect the same pattern from scammers.",
      "They know:",
      "People are dealing with taxes and government accountsBenefits and subscriptions reset or renewFinancial stress is higher after the holidays",
      "People are dealing with taxes and government accounts",
      "Benefits and subscriptions reset or renew",
      "Financial stress is higher after the holidays",
      "But the biggest reason scams spike now? Your personal data is easier to find than you think. Data brokers quietly collect and update profiles year after year. By January, those profiles are often more complete than ever, and scammers know it.",
      "The \"account verification\" scam you'll see everywhere",
      "One of the most common January scams looks harmless at first. You get a message saying:",
      "\"Your Social Security account needs verification\"\"Your Medicare information has to be updated\"\"Your benefits could be delayed without action\"",
      "\"Your Social Security account needs verification\"",
      "\"Your Medicare information has to be updated\"",
      "\"Your benefits could be delayed without action\"",
      "The message sounds official. Sometimes it even uses your real name or location. That's where people get tricked. Government agencies don't ask for sensitive information through random emails or texts. Scammers rely on urgency and familiarity to push you into reacting before thinking.",
      "My rule: If you didn't initiate the request, don't respond to it. Always go directly to the agency's official website or phone number, never through a link sent to you.",
      "MAKE 2026 YOUR MOST PRIVATE YEAR YET BY REMOVING BROKER DATA",
      "January is a prime time for fraud because people are dealing with taxes, benefits and account updates. Scammers know these messages feel expected and familiar. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Fake tax and benefits notices ramp up in January",
      "Another favorite scam this time of year involves taxes and refunds.",
      "You may see:",

      "Emails claiming you owe back taxes",
      "Messages saying you're due a refund",
      "Notices asking you to \"confirm\" banking information.",
      "These scams work because they arrive at exactly the moment people expect to hear from tax agencies or benefits programs.",
      "Scammers don't need much to sound convincing. A name, an email address or an old address is often enough. If you get a tax-related message out of the blue, slow down. Real agencies don't pressure you to act immediately.",
      "Subscription \"problems\" that aren't real",
      "January is also when subscription scams explode. Fake messages claim:",

      "Your payment didn't go through",
      "Your account is suspended.",
      "Scammers know most people have subscriptions, so they play the odds. Instead of clicking, open the app or website directly. If there's a real problem, you'll see it there.",
      "Why these scams feel so personal",
      "People often tell me, \"But they used my name, how did they know?\" Here's the uncomfortable truth: They probably bought it. Data brokers compile massive profiles that include:",
      "Address historiesPhone numbers and emailsFamily connectionsShopping behavior.",
      "Address histories",
      "Phone numbers and emails",
      "Family connections",
      "Shopping behavior.",
      "That data is sold, shared and leaked. Once scammers have it, they can tailor messages that feel real, because they're built on real information.",
      "10 WAYS TO PROTECT SENIORS FROM EMAIL SCAMS",
      "The more personal data scammers have, the more convincing their messages become. Removing your information from data broker sites can help reduce targeted scams over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you should do right now",
      "Before January gets any busier, take these steps to reduce your exposure to scams and fraud:",
      "Deleting emails or blocking numbers helps, but it does not stop scams at the source. Scammers rely on data broker sites that quietly collect, update and sell your personal information. Removing your data from those sites reduces scam calls, phishing emails and targeted texts over time. It also makes it harder for criminals to personalize messages using your real name, address or family connections. You have two ways to do this:",
      "Do it yourself:",
      "You can visit individual data broker websites, search for your profile and submit opt-out requests.This method works, but it takes time. Each site has its own rules, identity verification steps, and response timelines. Many brokers also re-add data later, which means you have to repeat the process regularly.",
      "Use a data removal service:",
      "A data removal service automates the opt-out process by contacting hundreds of data brokers on your behalf and monitoring for re-listings. This option saves time and provides ongoing protection, especially if you want long-term results without constant follow-ups.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "If you did not initiate the request, do not click. Scam messages are designed to create urgency, especially around taxes, benefits and account issues. Instead, go directly to the official website by typing the address yourself or using a saved bookmark. This single habit prevents most phishing attacks.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a critical second layer of protection. Even if someone gets your password, they still cannot access your account without the second verification code. Start with email, financial accounts, social media and government services.",
      "If you receive a warning about an account problem, do not trust the message itself. Open the official app or website, and check there. If something is wrong, you will see it immediately. If not, you just avoided a scam.",
      "Enable login alerts and security notifications on important accounts. These alerts can warn you if someone tries to sign in from a new device or location. Early warnings give you time to act before real damage occurs.",
      "Reusing passwords makes it easy for scammers to take over multiple accounts at once. If one service is compromised, attackers try the same login on email, banking, and social media accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account without needing to remember them. Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "January scams aren't random. They're targeted, timed and fueled by personal data that shouldn't be public in the first place. The longer your information stays online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. If you want a quieter inbox, fewer scam calls and less risk this year, take action early, before criminals finish rebuilding their lists. Protect your data now, and you'll be safer all year long.",

      "Within the NATO alliance, France and the U.K. are the only members that have nuclear weapons apart from the U.S, though their arsenals are much smaller and less capable.",
      "The U.S. has approximately 3,700 nuclear warheads. France has about 290, which are capable of being launched from submarines and aircraft, and the United Kingdom has an estimated 225 warheads for its submarine fleet.",
      "A former senior U.S. official said France and the U.K. lack the firepower to deter Russia on their own, dismissing the idea as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Their nuclear stockpiles are \u201cpitiful,\u201d the official said, as they have not maintained it for several decades and relied on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.",
      "Some European officials also are skeptical that France could provide a credible alternative to the vast American nuclear arsenal, and they worry that any changes Macron commits to make could be scrapped depending on who wins France\u2019s 2027 elections.",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, for instance, has said France\u2019s nuclear arsenal should only be used for France.",
      "In Sweden, the leader of the right-leaning Democrats and member of the country\u2019s governing coalition, Jimmie Akeeson, said last March that \u201ceverything should be on the table,\u201d including European countries acquiring their own nuclear weapons, amid concerns about whether Europe can rely on the U.S.",
      "But Heloise Fayet, a research fellow at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, suggested the discussions among European countries about establishing their own nuclear weapons programs could be more of a tactic than a reality.",
      "\u201cI see that more as a call for help,\u201d Fayet said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, help us, or we will do something crazy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview with NBC News that the nuclear deterrence issue is one that can be resolved within the NATO alliance.",
      "\u201cWe are, for the time being, very reliant on the United States. And I would say it is also in the U.S. interest to have that umbrella in place and also to engage strongly within NATO,\u201d Valtonen said. \u201cOf course, we are open to any questions or any ideas, and especially solutions, what comes to nuclear deterrence in the future.\u201d",
      "Concerns in Europe about countering Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal also come against the backdrop of a collapse in arms control agreements between the U.S. and Russia.",
      "In July, France and Britain announced an agreement on nuclear cooperation, dubbed the \u201cNorwood Declaration,\u201d but details of it are scant.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in March that his country \u201cis talking seriously\u201d with French officials about coming under the protection of France\u2019s nuclear weapons. And even before he took office, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last year he was open to the idea of France providing a nuclear umbrella for Germany, a proposal that previous German governments rejected.",
      "Their comments came after Macron publicly proposed to begin talks with European states to discuss how France\u2019s nuclear capability could contribute to the security of the continent.",
      "Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel said in an interview with NBC News that the Netherlands is \u201cnot completely closed off\u201d to the idea of France providing nuclear deterrence for European countries.",
      "Other European governments, including Germany, have expressed broad interest in having France play a larger role, but they also have not outlined a definitive position.",
      "The Dutch foreign minister, speaking to NBC News while in Davos for the World Economic Forum, added, \u201cWe still consider NATO to be the cornerstone of our security. At the same time, we do see that the world is changing and that we\u2019re entering a world of geopolitical competition where also Europe needs to step up and needs to become more of an equal partner to the U.S. than we are right now.\u201d",
      "A British official declined to comment directly on nuclear weapons discussions among European nations. \u201cOur posture is in constant review and responds to evolving threats,\u201d the official said.",
      "Unlike France, Britain is heavily dependent on the U.S. military for nuclear missiles and other support for its arsenal.",
      "Macron\u2019s expected speech on France\u2019s nuclear policy, which could come as soon as February, could clarify what Paris is prepared to do."

      "An internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement document in May shows that ICE told officers and agents they can forcibly enter homes of people subject to deportation without warrants signed by judges.",
      "The memo, dated May 12, which reads that it is from ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons, was shared with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., by two whistleblowers.",
      "It says ICE agents are allowed to forcibly enter a person\u2019s home using an administrative warrant if a judge has issued a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d Administrative warrants permit officers and agents to make arrests and are different from judicial warrants, which judges or magistrates sign allowing entry into homes.",
      "Lyons notes in the document that detaining people \u201cin their residences\u201d based solely on administrative warrants is a change from past procedures.",
      "\u201cAlthough the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,\u201d the memo reads.",
      "The memo says agents may \u201carrest and detain aliens\u201d in their places of residence who are subject to final orders of removal issued by immigration judges, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or U.S. district or magistrate judges.",
      "The memo says under general guidelines that officers and agents using a method called Form I-205 must \u201cknock and announce\u201d and that \u201cin announcing, officers and agents must state their identity and purpose.\u201d",
      "It says that officers and agents must give the people inside time to comply with the order.",
      "It also says that they generally should not enter a residence before 6 a.m. or after 10 p.m., and that they \"should only use a necessary and reasonable amount of force\u201d to enter a home.",
      "The Associated Press first reported the document Wednesday.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that immigrants in the country illegally who are served administrative warrants or I-205s, which are removal or deportation warrants, \u201chave had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cFor decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.\u201d",
      "The group Whistleblower Aid, which is representing the whistleblowers who shared the memo with Congress, said, \u201cThis \u2018policy\u2019 flies in the face of longstanding federal law enforcement training material and policies, all rooted in constitutional assessments.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn other words: the Form I-205 does not authorize ICE agents to enter a home,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cTraining new recruits, many of whom have zero prior law enforcement training or experience, to seemingly disregard the Fourth Amendment, should be of grave concern to everyone.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal said in a statement that the memo was \u201callegedly not widely distributed\u201d despite being labeled \u201call-hands.\u201d A copy of the memo shared with Congress is addressed to \u201cAll ICE Personnel.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, the disclosure claims that the memo was rolled out in a secretive manner in which some agents were verbally briefed while others were allowed to view it but not keep a copy,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cIt was reportedly clear that anyone who openly spoke out against this new directive would be fired.\u201d",
      "Whistleblower Aid wrote in its disclosure that the memo was addressed to \u201cAll ICE Personnel\" but that in practice it was only shown to \"select DHS officials.\"",
      "Those officials were then to verbally brief the plan, the group said. Supervisors showed it some employees, including the whistleblowers, and directed them to read it and return it, according to the group.",
      "Whistleblower Aid also cites past ICE and DHS training materials that says entering a residence on solely an administrative warrant can cause violations of Fourth Amendment constitutional protections.",
      "The memo is dated less than four months into the second term of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on mass deportations.",
      "Immigration crackdowns by the Trump administration against several Democrat-run cities have sparked protests and unrest, most recently in Minneapolis after an ICE agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, on Jan. 7.",
      "Blumenthal said in a statement that the newly revealed ICE policy should terrify Americans.",
      "\u201cIt is a legally and morally abhorrent policy that exemplifies the kinds of dangerous, disgraceful abuses America is seeing in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our democracy, with vanishingly rare exceptions, the government is barred from breaking into your home without a judge giving a green light.\u201d",
      "The ICE memo says that Form I-205 is not a search warrant and that it \u201cshould only be used to enter the residence of the subject alien to conduct an immigration arrest.\u201d",

      "People who interact with chatbots for emotional support or other personal reasons are likelier to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, a new study finds.",
      "The researchers from Mass General Brigham surveyed 20,847 mostly white men and women in the United States about their AI usage and mental health symptoms.",
      "In the survey, published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, 10.3% of participants reported using artificial intelligence \u201cat least daily\u201d and 5% reported using it \u201cmultiple times per day.\u201d Of those using an AI program at least daily, nearly half were using it for work and about 11% used it for school. Among daily users, 87.1% reported using it for personal reasons, which could include recommendations, advice or emotional support.",
      "Dr. Roy Perlis, a lead author of the study, said that most people\u2019s exposure to artificial intelligence is through chatbots.",
      "The mean age of the participants in the study was 47. Those who used chatbots daily for personal reasons were likelier to experience at least moderate depression or other feelings of anxiety and irritability, compared to people who didn\u2019t use AI.",
      "Participants were asked whether or how often in the past two weeks they had trouble concentrating, sleeping, eating or thought about hurting themselves. Common symptoms of depression include feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, lack of energy and lacking motivation.",
      "Users with ages between 45 and 64 were likelier to report depressive symptoms with AI use.",
      "Previous research has shown that some people turn to AI for emotional support and even romantic relationships. Early studies have shown that chatbots specifically designed for mental health treatment may be useful as an adjunct for therapy. Other studies analyzing general chatbots, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, said they may be problematic to people with mental health conditions.",
      "However, the American Psychological Association advises against using AI as a replacement for therapy and psychological treatment.",
      "Perlis said the average difference in depression severity between chatbot users and nonusers was small, but warned some people may struggle more severely than others.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s probably a subset of people where AI use is associated with no change in their mood, or even benefit in their mood,\u201d said Perlis, who serves as vice chair for research in the department of psychiatry at Mass General Brigham. \u201cBut that also means there are a subset where AI use is probably associated with worsening of their mood, and for some people, that can be substantially greater levels of depression.\u201d",
      "The researchers observed what\u2019s called a \u201cdose response,\u201d meaning the more frequently someone used AI, the stronger their symptoms were.",
      "Using AI for work or school wasn\u2019t associated with symptoms of depression.",
      "For people who use AI for personal reasons, Perlis said it can \u201crun the gamut\u201d on the nature of their interactions, and AI chatbots are a way of having a \u201csocial interaction that otherwise would be difficult for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the case at all that all AI is harmful and chatbots are harmful,\u201d said Perlis, who is also an associate editor of JAMA Network Open. \u201cI think my concern is particularly for these sort of general-purpose chatbots. They\u2019re really not designed to take up people\u2019s social support or mental health support, and so when we use them that way, I think there\u2019s some risk.\u201d",
      "The survey has a number of limitations. It shows an association between AI and negative mental health symptoms, not cause and effect. The study also didn't identify what specific AI programs participants were using, nor did it define what personal use meant.",
      "'A vicious cycle'",
      "It also may be likely that people who are more depressed are likelier to turn to AI programs for companionship.",
      "Dr. Jodi Halpern, co-director for the Kavli Center for Ethics, Science and the Public at UC Berkeley, noted the study doesn\u2019t show that AI causes depression.",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, associate professor of biomedical data science, psychiatry and computer science at Dartmouth College, said people may seek out AI for therapy if they\u2019re unhappy with standard care and because it\u2019s easier to access.",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need more studies to really understand why it is those groups in particular are more likely to use this, certainly.\u201d",
      "Halpern added that future research on AI should focus on its effects on people\u2019s mental health, and this study \u201cstretches our attention to look at the people we might not have been paying attention to.\u201d",
      "Perlis\u2019 study isn\u2019t a warning call, he said, but people should take into account their AI use and whether it\u2019s helping them or not.",
      "\u201c[People] should be mindful when they\u2019re interacting with a chatbot about how often they\u2019re doing it, what they\u2019re doing it instead of, and if they feel better or worse after they\u2019ve had an extended interaction,\" he said."

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift called \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor Justin Baldoni an expletive in a text message with Blake Lively, according to messages unsealed Tuesday as part of an ongoing legal battle.",
      "The messages were unsealed as part of Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni, her co-star in the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Wayfarer Studios and others, litigation that has been going on for over a year.",
      "According to the court document, which Lively\u2019s lawyers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swift wrote, \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin.\u201d",
      "In the motion, Lively\u2019s lawyers confirmed the quoted language but disputed the defense\u2019s assertion that it was said while Swift and Lively were discussing \u2014 on Dec. 4 and 5, 2024 \u2014 a forthcoming New York Times article that reported that Baldoni and the CEO of Wayfarer had launched a \u201cretaliatory \u2018smear campaign\u2019\u201d against Lively.",
      "Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Swift licensed a song for \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d but was not otherwise involved in the film, Swift\u2019s spokesperson said last year, when there was an attempt to subpoena her as a possible witness in the trial.",
      "Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively\u2019s legal team, said Tuesday that the new filing includes \u201cdamning\u201d statements about Baldoni from other people.",
      "\u201cThe newly unsealed, damning documents show the consistent reaction numerous women, cast, crew, executives, partners, co-host and even his own PR team had working with Justin Baldoni,\u201d McCawley said.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement released by Wayfarer\u2019s public relations team that they are confident Baldoni\u2019s name will be cleared.",
      "\u201cAs stated all along, and reflected in our clients motions, as well as in messages from Sony discussing Ms. Lively\u2019s behaviors, the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law,\u201d Freedman said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing by Lively\u2019s lawyers deals with the re-filing of public versions of exhibits that were part of an earlier motion by Lively\u2019s attorneys opposing a summary judgment in the case.",
      "An attorney for Baldoni previously called the allegations in the lawsuit \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, 2024, that accused Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively after she raised issues about his on-set behavior.",
      "She filed a federal civil lawsuit against Baldoni, who is also a co-founder and co-owner of Wayfarer Studios and who directed \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. In February, she filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, the company, the company\u2019s CEO and others.",
      "Baldoni filed a countersuit against Lively seeking $400 million, but a federal judge dismissed it in June and formally ended it in November after an amended complaint was not filed by a court-set deadline.",
      "Lively\u2019s amended complaint, which does not name a dollar amount, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It alleges that there was a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d by Baldoni and his team to destroy her reputation.",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who moves to Boston with a dream of opening a flower shop and marries neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. The film explores Bloom\u2019s decision to break a cycle of domestic abuse and divorce him.",

The musical was inspired by the painting of Seurat's real life masterpiece, \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\"",

      "\u201cThe two of us participating in this ends up forcing him into meeting all sorts of new people and enlarging his circle and then we can share that experience,\u201d Grody says.",
      "An experience Patinkin says he can\u2019t wait to have is seeing the \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d revival. The show, which will run at the Barbican Theatre, does not yet have an opening date, but tickets go on sale in May.",

The first time I saw it was when other people did it. So I cannot wait to see these wonderful gifted performers, actors do this. It will be such a thrill for us all.\u201d",

      "Months later, Mary Katherine Smart\u2019s ability to place a name with the voice became a major break in the case as police searched tirelessly to find her older sister. Mary Katherine remembered the voice of a man who briefly worked on her family\u2019s Salt Lake City home and police identified as Brian David Mitchell.",

      "Mary Katherine\u2019s crucial role in Smart\u2019s ultimate rescue is examined in the new Netflix documentary \u201cKidnapped: Elizabeth Smart.\u201d",
      "In an exclusive interview on TODAY on Jan. 21, Elizabeth Smart reflected on the important role Mary Katherine played in her story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Smart said. \u201cShe saved me.\u201d",
      "The documentary recounts how authorities initially investigated members of Smart\u2019s family, including her father, as well as a former contractor who worked on the house, as they searched for the abductor. Both were dead ends, but Mary Katherine\u2019s remembrance of the man whose voice she heard proved to be invaluable information.",
      "Mary Katherine appears in the documentary, where she describes her inability to sleep after the abduction and feeling like she was \u201calone on an island\u201d because police did not want her speaking to anyone about the crime.",
      "\u201cHad she not remembered who had kidnapped me, who\u2019s to say that I would be here today?\u201d Elizabeth Smart said on TODAY. \u201cThe police all had their suspects, and my captor I don\u2019t even think was on their radar at all. So she is my hero.\u201d",
      "Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from her bedroom in her family\u2019s home by Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. The couple took Smart to a tent in the mountains outside Salt Lake City, where Smart said Mitchell raped and tortured her nearly every day of the nine months she was held captive.",
      "She was rescued on March 12, 2003, when two couples called the police believing they had just seen Elizabeth Smart after recognizing Mitchell and Barzee from an episode of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d",
      "Mitchell is currently serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee, who was sentenced to 15 years for her role in the kidnapping, was released from a Utah prison in 2018. She was then arrested in May 2025 for visiting two Salt Lake City parks, which violated her status as a sex offender.",
      "Smart, 38, has since become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. She also has helped other kidnapping victims recover and shined a spotlight on other survivors of abduction.",
      "In 2023, she marked 20 years since being rescued with a message of gratitude. She opened up about what it\u2019s like when people approach her to thank her for sharing her story or admire her perseverance.",
      "\u201cInitially it was so shocking because that was not me,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cI was happy to blend in. I wasn\u2019t anybody, and so that was very overwhelming when I first got home. And then I would also say it was surprising just like how long and how many people still remembered my story.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd now it\u2019s been 20-plus years, and so it\u2019s not uncommon to have people come up and approach me, but I guess even sitting here 20-plus years later is surprising,\u201d she continued. \u201cI would never have imagined this for my life. I never would\u2019ve thought my life would go in this direction.\u201d",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour. Smart spoke about whether she has talked to her daughters Chloe, 10, and Olivia, 8, and son James, 6, about her story.",
      "\u201cOne of the best pieces of advice I was given as far as parenting goes: When your kids start asking questions, that\u2019s the right time to start talking about it,\u201d Smart said. \u201cAnd honestly, that started way before I was prepared, way before I ever thought it would come up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think my oldest was, like 3 years old when she started asking me questions, like where was I going, what was I doing, why was I doing it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd that was shocking. I was not ready. Honestly I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m still ready. But I would say that opened the door to start having those conversations, and then just as they have grown, I\u2019ve been able to let that conversation grow as well.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "An interaction at the 2026 Golden Globes red carpet has led to a wider conversation about the GlamBOT and its famous operator.",
      "Jennifer Lopez always makes a statement on the red carpet, but the singer's brief interaction with a camera crew at the Jan. 11 Golden Globes had onlookers scrutinizing her behavior, and later GlamBOT director Cole Walliser's.",
      "If you haven't seen it yet, the video shows Lopez stopping by the popular GlamBOT photo station on the Golden Globes red carpet on her way into the awards show. In the brief clip, the singer poses and walks away.",
      "What happened? Why has it led to a larger controversy?  Here's what to know.",
      "What is a GlamBOT?",
      "If you've ever watched live red carpet coverage on E! News, you're likely familiar with the GlamBOT.",
      "For years, celebrities have been stopping by the GlamBOT photo station on red carpets to get a slow-mo glam shot.",
      "The slow-motion camera's official website describes the technology as a \"state of the art cinematic robotic arm that pairs functionality and usability.\"",
      "Who Is Cole Walliser?",
      "Walliser is a filmmaker and director who has operated the GlamBOT for E! since 2016. He occasionally appears in the videos, as he did in Lopez's recent one.",
      "Walliser is not the inventor of the well-known camera. According to AdWeek, director Joseph Kahn, behind the video for \u201cBad Blood\u201d by Taylor Swift, worked with E! to create the methodology.",
      "\u201cThe lighting, camera work, lens choices, and methodology are all my design,\u201d Kahn wrote on X recently.",
      "What Happened in J. Lo\u2019s Golden Globes GlamBOT Video?",
      "Walliser shared a video of his interaction with Lopez on Instagram, captioning the post, \"The Queen JLO!! She walked the carpet so close to it closing (it might have technically been closed at that point), so I was happy she was able to quickly stop. No messing around \u2014 just wham, bam, thank you, GLAM!\"",
      "In the short clip, Lopez walked up to the photo station and Walliser greeted her, saying, \"Hi, my dear.\" She responded by saying, \"Hi.\"",
      "When Walliser said, \"Lovely to see you again. You look amazing,\" Lopez said, \"Nice to see you.\" The director then proceeded to instruct the star on where to stand for her glam shot.",
      "Walliser asked Lopez if she had an idea of a move or pose she wanted to do for her photo and she showed him rather than responding.",
      "Lopez then turned around while preparing for the camera to take the photo.",
      "Afterwards, Walliser complimented the star, saying, \"Slayed it as usual. Thank you so much.\" Lopez then walked away and waved to other photographers.",
      "Some viewers read into the interaction, noticing Lopez seemed to avoid eye contact with Walliser and barely spoke to him.",
      "\"This doesn\u2019t help her reputation of being rude lol,\" one commented.",
      "Another wrote, \"My favorite part was when she didn\u2019t look at, speak to, or smile at you.\"",
      "Several social media users applauded Walliser for maintaining his high energy throughout the brief interaction.",
      "\"Cole you\u2019re a better person than me, I will just say that,\" one commented.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Lopez for comment and has not heard back by the time of publication.",
      "What Cole Walliser Said About the Interaction with Jennifer Lopez",
      "Walliser shared a follow-up video on Instagram on Jan. 18 addressing the interaction. He started by explaining that celebrities aren't required to stop by the GlamBOT station.",
      "\u201cAnybody that stops, I already like you, because you\u2019re taking the time to do my thing and this is generous of you because you don't have to do it,\" he said.",
      "Walliser said that red carpets are \"so insane\" and hectic. He said he doesn't blame celebrities if they're not sure how to act when they approach his station.",
      "\"Some people: chatty at work. Some people: Not so chatty at work,\" he said.",
      "Regarding his interaction with Lopez, Walliser said he \"didn't take it personally.\"",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel rude in that moment,\u201d he said.",
      "The director noted that Lopez was simply \"down to business\" since the red carpet was closed by the time she arrived at the GlamBOT station.",
      "\"She knew what she was going to do. She got into the position and I think it was just unfortunate that the position was she was facing away from me. So I am talking to her, she is looking away. But she's getting ready for the move,\" he said.",
      "Then, Walliser's Alleged Emails Came Under Scrutiny",
      "Following Lopez\u2019s viral red carpet moment, another GlamBOT controversy has also arisen, this time allegedly involving Walliser and a potential customer.",
      "A woman named Yinka Animashaun shared an exchange she allegedly had with Walliser on X. In 2019, she says she inquired about using the GlamBOT for a wedding. She says Walliser then seemed to doubt whether she could pay for his GlamBOT services.",
      "In an interview with People, Aminashaun said she was \u201churt\u201d by his purported response.",
      "\u201cI was preparing for one of the best days of my life, and to this day, his response shocks me. That isn\u2019t how you speak to a potential client or people in general. Hopefully my sharing this can be a learning experience for him and enable him [to] be better or at least a bit more kind,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "What happened to Elizabeth Smart? Where is she now? This is the true story of her abduction.",
    "story": [
      "It was an abduction so brazen that local law enforcement officials said they had never seen anything like it in their careers.",
      "A 14-year-old Utah girl named Elizabeth Smart had been taken at knifepoint out of the bedroom of her family home in June 2002 with her 9-year-old sister in the room.",
      "An intensive manhunt ensued, while the search for her abductor put members of her family under stressful scrutiny. Meanwhile, Smart was in captivity in the mountains outside Salt Lake City under the control of a violent kidnapper.",
      "The saga of Smart's abduction, her terrifying ordeal and her rescue are the subject of the new Netflix documentary, \"Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart,\" which began streaming on Jan. 21.",
      "Here is what to know about her story.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart?",
      "Smart was a 14-year-old girl living in Salt Lake City with her parents, four brothers and younger sister when she was abducted by a man at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Her family describes her in the documentary as a normal teenager who enjoyed playing the harp and hanging out with her friends and siblings.",
      "Her younger sister, Mary Katherine, who was 9 years old at the time, was in the room during the abduction. Mary Katherine says in the documentary, and elsewhere like in the investigative book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation,\" the man told her he would kill her if she alerted their parents.",
      "She recognized his voice, but couldn't pinpoint who it exactly was, and her parents were unaware of the intruder. Mary Katherine ultimately alerted them to Elizabeth being taken at 3:58 a.m., and they discovered a screen had been cut in the kitchen and a window was open.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t keep her from harm\u2019s way,\" their father, Ed Smart, says in the documentary. \"That just repeats over in your mind, over and over and over again.\"",
      "A bloodhound brought by police tracked Elizabeth's scent up a hill in the backyard, but lost the scent when the dog reached the street.",
      "Who Was Investigated for Elizabeth Smart's Abduction?",
      "As police began searching for leads, they looked into Ed Smart and his two brothers, David and Tom Smart, who are Elizabeth's uncles.",
      "Ed Smart recalled his reaction after his now-ex-wife, Lois Smart, told him that law enforcement did not believe he had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance.",
      "\"I was overwhelmed to the point that I was shaking and couldn\u2019t stop shaking,\" he says in the documentary.",
      "Ed Smart added that the scrutiny on him and his brothers also had the negative effect of fewer people wanting to help the effort to find Elizabeth.",
      "After the police found nothing suspicious among the family, the spotlight turned to Richard Ricci, a contractor who had been in a dispute with Ed Smart after doing work on the family's home. Ricci had a criminal past and was brought in for questioning.",
      "He vehemently denied having anything to do with Smart's abduction in interrogation footage seen in the film.",
      "On July 24, 2002, police said someone tried to break into the home of Smart's cousin, using a similar method to the break-in at the Smarts' home. Ricci was in jail at the time, and Mary Katherine Smart says in the documentary that she knew Ricci was not the man in the room that night.",
      "Ricci died from an aneurysm in his prison cell while Elizabeth was still missing.",
      "How Did Police Identify Elizabeth Smart's Abductor?",
      "Weeks after Smart's abduction, Mary Katherine Smart said she remembered a name associated with the man's voice she heard that night: Immanuel.",
      "The girls had met the man while he was preaching on the street in Salt Lake City months earlier, and he had done work on the Smarts' home. According to the book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation\" by Lee Benson and Tom Smart, Lois Smart saw Mitchell begging for money on the street and handed him money and her husband's phone number, in case he was willing to work. He worked for five hours at the Smarts' home.",
      "The family ultimately released the sketch to the crime show \"America's Most Wanted,\" which led a man to call Ed Smart's brother, Tom Smart, and say the man in the sketch might be his brother-in-law, Brian David Mitchell.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart After She Was Abducted?",
      "In the documentary, Smart describes her horrific treatment at the hands of Mitchell after being taken into the mountains into a tent by him and his wife, Wanda Barzee.",
      "\"I remember feeling like my doom was approaching,\" Smart said in the documentary. \"He said, 'I hereby seal you to me as my wife before God and his angels as my witnesses.'\"",
      "Smart screamed and was told if she screamed again, he would kill her. She said Mitchell then raped her in the tent, which continued throughout her captivity.",
      "\"I had gone from never even holding a boy\u2019s hand to being raped every day, multiple times a day,\" she said in the film.",
      "She remembered not even knowing the difference between consensual sex and rape at the time.",
      "\"I felt a lot of shame, and I felt like I was filthy. I felt like if my family knew what happened to me, would they still want me back?\" she said. \"Maybe it would be better if nobody ever found me.\"",
      "Smart said in the film that Mitchell also walked her around like a dog and forced her to drink alcohol until she vomited.",
      "\"More than anything, he loved power,\" she said. \"He loved feeling like he was in control.\"",
      "She also reflects on questions on why she didn't try to escape or alert others when Mitchell and Barzee took her to Salt Lake City for excursions.",
      "\"The thought of crying out did cross my mind, but I was 14, (and) I had been extremely abused for months,\" she said. \"When I disobeyed, I was raped. I did have food withheld from me. So when I made my bid for freedom, I wanted it to be a sure thing.\"",
      "How Was Elizabeth Smart Rescued?",
      "Smart had a few close calls before she was ultimately found. She said in the documentary that at one point she, Mitchell and Barzee were looking at maps in a Salt Lake City library when a homicide detective approached them and wanted to ask some question.",
      "Smart was in a long, white robe with a face covering, and Mitchell refused to let the detective pull it down, saying it was against their religion. The detective accepted the explanation and walked away.",
      "A nightclub patron described seeing the trio at a Salt Lake City establishment, where Barzee and Smart were dressed in the same white robes with face coverings.",
      "Smart also recalled another moment in which she could faintly hear her name being called in the woods, when searchers were presumably yelling out for her. She said Mitchell threatened to kill her if she tried to answer them.",
      "After being taken to a location outside San Diego, Smart said she convinced Mitchell to return them to Salt Lake City, so they took a bus to Sandy, Utah.",
      "On March 12, 2003, a person called local police saying they believed they had just seen Elizabeth Smart walking on the street after recognizing Barzee and Mitchell from the \"America's Most Wanted\" episode.",
      "Police cars pulled up alongside Smart, Barzee and Mitchell. After separating Smart from her captors, they asked if she was Elizabeth Smart.",
      "\"My captors were just right there,\" she said. \"I was terrified. I needed the safest answer I could possibly give.\"",
      "When the officers asked if she was Elizabeth Smart, she responded, \"If thou sayeth,\" confirming it was her.",
      "She was now 15 years old and had been missing for nearly 300 days.",
      "What Happened to Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee?",
      "Smart's rescue was not the end of her ordeal, as the court case involving Mitchell and Barzee dragged out until 2010.",
      "Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison on kidnapping and sexual assault charges, NBC News reported at the time, while Barzee received a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to assisting the kidnapping and was given credit for seven years she had already served.",
      "Barzee was released from prison in 2018. Smart begged prison officials to reconsider.",
      "Barzee, 79, was arrested in May 2025 for visiting two parks in Salt Lake City, which she cannot do because of her status as a sex offender.",
      "Where Is Elizabeth Smart Today?",
      "Smart, 38, has become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation.",
      "She also wrote a book about her harrowing experience, \u201cMy Story,\u201d which was released in 2013. Smart marked 20 years since being rescued in 2023.",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour.",
      "\"I have good days, I have bad days, but I developed a better relationship with myself,\" she says in the documentary. \"My inner voice has changed from, 'You should\u2019ve done this,' or, 'You could\u2019ve done that,' to, 'You'll make it through this, you can finish this, you\u2019re strong, keep going. You can survive anything that comes your way.'\""

      "I do not want to reconcile with my family. I\u2019m not being controlled, I\u2019m standing up for myself for the first time in my life.",
      "For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into. Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they\u2019ll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.",
      "My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn\u2019t stopped. My mum cancelled making Nicola\u2019s dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress. Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children. They were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since. During the wedding planning, my mum went so far as to call me \u2018evil\u2019 because Nicola and I chose to include my Nanny Sandra and Nicola\u2019s Naunni at our table because they both didn\u2019t have their husbands. Both of our parents had their own tables equally adjacent to ours.",
      "The night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was \u2018not blood\u2019 and \u2018not family.\u2019 Since the moment I started standing up for myself with my family, I\u2019ve received endless attacks from my parents, both publicly and privately, that were sent to the press on their orders. Even my brothers were sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last Summer. My mum hijacked my first dance with my wife, which had been planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song. In front of our 500 wedding guests, Marc Anthony called me to the stage where the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I\u2019ve never felt more uncomfortable humiliated in my entire life. We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.",
      "My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we\u2019ve tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.",
      "Despite this, we still travelled to London for my dad\u2019s birthday and were rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him. He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner. When he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn\u2019t invited. It was a slap in the face. Later, when my family travelled to LA, they refused to see me at all.",
      "My family values public promotion and endorsement above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family \u2018love\u2019 is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it\u2019s at the expense of our professional obligations. We\u2019ve gone out of our way for years to show up and support at every fashion show, every party and every press activity to show \u2018our perfect family.\u2019 But the one time my wife asked for my mum\u2019s support to save displaced dogs during the LA fires, my mum refused.",
      "The narrative that my wife controls me is completely backwards. I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared. I wake up every morning grateful for the life I chose, and have found peace and relief.",
      "My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation. All we want peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family."

      "With just a few weeks into the year, the year 2016 has been trending and making people nostalgic and reminiscing about the early days of social media \u2014 and the house parties, the clubs, the music and the fashion.",
      "On TikTok, the hashtag #2016 has more than 2 million posts, often used to caption throwback photos, old videos and reflections on the unique pop culture moments and aesthetic trends of the year.",
      "In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 dropped \"Lemonade\" and we were all wondering who was Becky with the good hair, Kylie Jenner was winning the beauty game with her lip kits, Snapchat and its filters took over, \"Damn Daniel\" had people cracking up and everyone was invited to Rubi's quincea\u00f1era.

      "Why Are People Nostalgic for 2016?",
      "Routledge, also an executive vice president and COO at Archbridge Institute, adds that millennials and older Gen Z are the ones most affected by \u201ctechnological transformations\u201d amid the advances of artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to be nostalgic when they\u2019re anxious about the future or they\u2019re not sure what direction in life to take,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I think this generation is dealing with those anxieties, and they\u2019re using nostalgia as a way to respond to them.\u201d",

      "She believes people \u201csaw a lot more heart\u201d with the content, stressing that nowadays as a content creator, \u201cThe heavier the algorithms get on all the social media platforms, the more robotic our content becomes.\u201d",

      "Routledge says that it doesn't have to be the year 2016 specifically for people to be nostalgic. He explains that the way nostalgia works is people tend to have more time to curate the memories and the experiences that they found happy, energizing or inspirational.",
      "As time goes by, they have more time to \u201cput aside the negatives, or if we are thinking about the negatives, we\u2019ve had more time to integrate that negative into a more redemptive or useful story.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you go through something and it\u2019s difficult at the moment, you don\u2019t really appreciate it, but after some time has passed, you can say, \u2018Well, maybe I learned something from that. It\u2019s made me who I am. It\u2019s helped me grow as a person,\u2019\u201d he adds."

      "The visit by the group of 10 American lawmakers from both the House and Senate has not gone unnoticed, with the protesters saying they were closely following the developments. \u201cIt makes a huge difference that Congress members come here and listen,\u201d Kristime Due, who was attending the protest in Copenhagen, told NBC News.",
      "The delegation\u2019s visit was arranged on short notice and has played an almost counterprogramming role to the statements the Trump administration has been making. Trump\u2019s desire to own a part of the Danish kingdom is all over the airwaves in Danish news broadcasts, and Danes say it\u2019s a constant conversation.",
      "\u201cThis is a respectful and constructive delegation that came more to listen than to talk,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters on Saturday.",
      "\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been made clear to us is that the people of Denmark are very anxious, are quite concerned, and the people of Greenland even more so,\u201d Coons said, adding that the current tone of statements from the White House is \u201cnot constructive.\u201d",
      "Coons said the delegation is \u201chaving active conversations amongst ourselves about what is the wisest course of action\u201d to de-escalate the rhetoric when they return to Washington, but some members of the delegation do not want to rush into a hasty symbolic vote that could fall along party lines.",
      "\u201cI worry that going to a specific legislative vehicle right now today is premature,\u201d Coons said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this to become a partisan matter. We simply cannot,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. \u201cI think the way that we keep it from being partisan is by full education, dismissing some of the assumptions that some may have and then acting together,\u201d she added.",
      "The members of Congress met with members of the Danish Parliament on Friday, with the Social Democrats\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Flemming M\u00f8ller Mortensen, describing the discussion as \u201cfruitful\u201d and \u201cintense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel frightened,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cEspecially the people living in Greenland, both adults but also youngsters and kids, and that was also a part of what their Greenlandic colleagues [were] expressing today.\u201d",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, who is one of two Greenlandic representatives in the Danish Parliament, said that the \u201cuncertainty is really taking a toll\u201d on her people.",
      "\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Chemnitz said. \u201cSo what is on the table for the U.S. side right now is not interesting for us, and you can\u2019t buy a country.\u201d",
      "Pipaluk Lynge, a member of the Greenlandic Parliament, traveled to Copenhagen to participate in the meeting.",
      "\u201cIt was really important for us to tell them from our own voice, because we know how it is back home,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cThe children are worried; the adults are not sleeping.\u201d",
      "Both sides stressed Denmark\u2019s willingness for more U.S. military presence in Greenland.",
      "The U.S. has one military base in the Arctic territory, which has formed a core part of missile early-warning systems dating back to the Cold War. The base, which houses a small number of troops compared to thousands at its peak, was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "While the Trump administration\u2019s push to take Greenland has started to fray the decades-old alliance between the U.S. and Denmark, some are concerned about the broader impact on NATO if it moves to seize an ally\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cIf the United States were to carry out any of the current threats against Greenland, it would sever NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",
      "The Danes are keenly aware of how the alliance between the two countries has seen sacrifices in the past.",
      "\u201cIn Afghanistan and Iraq, Danes were actually serving alongside the American soldiers, and Denmark lost, per capita, a lot of soldiers,\u201d Almind, the military veteran, said at the protest in Copenhagen. \u201cLooking back, you have to ask yourself, was it all worth it?\u201d",
      "While Danes are hopeful that the U.S. delegation\u2019s support will resonate once they return to Washington, some are skeptical they can convince the president to change his mind when he seems determined to acquire Greenland at any cost.",
      "Danish protester Else Hatmann said the delegation contained \u201conly two [Republicans] who Trump don\u2019t even listen to.\u201d",
      "Murkowski, a frequent holdout who Trump earlier this month said \u201cshould never be elected to office again,\u201d pushed back against that sentiment, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the absence of Republicans is because they don\u2019t care about this issue.\u201d",
      "The other Republican on the trip, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has become an outspoken critic of Trump since he announced he would not run for re-election, but avoided interacting with reporters during the press events the delegation held."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 One of the most popular new apps in China poses an awkward question: \u201cAre you dead?\u201d",
      "An app by that name has gone viral as a digital \u201ccheck-in\u201d aimed mainly at the growing number of young people living alone in China\u2019s sprawling cities. The idea is to designate an emergency contact person, who will be alerted if a user goes a few days without confirming their well-being on the app.",
      "The app, which was free when it launched last May but now costs 8 yuan ($1.14), was the most downloaded paid app in Apple\u2019s App Store for China in recent days \u2014 though after its viral popularity, it appears to have since disappeared from the Chinese App Store under unclear circumstances.",
      "The app describes itself as a personal safety assistant, \u201cwhether you are a professional living solo, a student studying far from home, or anyone choosing an independent lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Ian Guo, one of the founders, told NBC News he was surprised by the success of the app, which cost less than $150 to make and is now valued at around $15 million.",
      "He said he and his two co-founders, who like him are members of China\u2019s \u201cpost-95 generation,\u201d were inspired by social media commenters who said this was something they needed.",
      "\u201cWe saw this opportunity and asked ourselves if we could quickly launch a product,\u201d Guo said. But they also believed the app \u201ccould truly provide people with more security and protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally lived alone in Shenzhen for a long time, so I understand the various problems one faces when living solo,\u201d he said, adding that the sense of loneliness and insecurity \u201cis constant.\u201d",
      "Though the concept may sound morbid, the app\u2019s popularity is a reflection of demographic changes in China, where urbanization, falling marriage rates and long work hours have left many feeling isolated.",
      "By 2030, China \u2014 a nation of 1.4 billion people \u2014 could have 200 million one-person households, according to the state-backed Global Times newspaper, which cited real estate research institutions.",
      "The app\u2019s name in Mandarin, \u201cSi Le Ma,\u201d appeared to be a play on the name of one of China\u2019s most popular food delivery apps, \u201cE Le Ma,\u201d which means \u201cAre You Hungry?\u201d Some found its emphasis on death too dark, and the app has now been renamed Demumu, which Guo said was \u201ccuter.\u201d",
      "\"\u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 sounds more like a joke,\" says Lisa Li, a 23-year-old English teacher. \"But Are You Alive? sounds like you\u2019re rising from the dead, and that would be even weirder.\"",
      "Li, 23, said she found the app \u201ca bit absurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be afraid that if I were forgetful and missed a check-in, people would actually think I\u2019m dead,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she thought most people were downloading the app out of curiosity. \u201cSome people really do worry that if they die, no one will find them,\u201d she added, pointing to a recent string of highly publicized cases of young Chinese professionals, particularly at tech companies, dying suddenly after long periods of intense work.",
      "Cui Xiyue, an exhibition planner in Beijing, said she downloaded the app when she was \u201cgoing through a period of depression and mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust getting through a single day back then wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Cui, 23.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got it, I checked in every day, but I didn\u2019t stick with it for very long,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t need it anymore, because I\u2019ve stopped thinking about those dark things.\u201d",
      "Loneliness has long been a concern for older people in China, where more than one-fifth of the population is over 60. When younger family members migrate from rural areas to cities, they are often left behind.",
      "But social isolation is also a problem for young Chinese, who are increasingly reluctant to get married and have children amid the rising cost of living and competition for jobs.",
      "Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said she thought the app would be helpful for young people living alone.",
      "\u201cOf course, to some extent they are joking, it\u2019s more sarcastic,\u201d said Tong, co-director of the university\u2019s Centre for Chinese Family Studies. On the other hand, she said, the app could lead people to reflect on their single life.",
      "Some commenters on Chinese social media were skeptical of the app\u2019s usefulness.",
      "\u201cDo people really use apps like this? If I get busy and forget to check in, wouldn\u2019t I end up \u2018dying\u2019 every other day?\u201d read one comment on Weibo.",
      "Others rejected the idea of having yet another place to report to.",
      "\u201cYou have to clock in for school, clock in for work, and now you have to clock in just to prove you aren\u2019t dead,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cChinese people \u2014 spending a lifetime \u2018clocking in.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tong said loneliness was less of a problem for young people than for older people because they are \u201cmore adaptive\u201d when it comes to using the internet to connect with the outside world.",
      "\u201cSome of the activities can be transferred offline,\u201d she said, pointing to the thousands of people who showed up in a village outside the Chinese city of Chongqing to help a young woman and her father slaughter pigs for a traditional banquet after she posted a callout last week on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.",
      "\u201cYoung people can find a way to overcome their own loneliness,\u201d Tong said, \u201cif they\u2019re really willing to.\u201d",

      "Iran has a grim history of crushing dissent, but the latest crackdown dwarfs anything seen during the repressive Islamic theocracy\u2019s 47 years in power, evidence trickling out of Iran suggests.",
      "Human rights activists say at least 2,500 people have been killed since protesters took to the streets last month, initially in a show of anger against rising prices and a faltering economy.",
      "\u201cThis crackdown is more intense because the scope of the protests is more widespread, playing out at the same time in big cities but also remote areas in central and western Iran,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment Therme, a nonresident fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies, a nongovernmental organization based in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s major geopolitical rival in the region.",
      "Since widespread demonstrations in 2022, the regime's goal \u201chas been to diffuse fear,\u201d both through killing protesters and executing prisoners, he said.",
      "Even the partial picture of what\u2019s happening inside Iran suggests something on a different level than past repression. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a nonpartisan Virginia-based organization that relies on supporters inside Iran to track the protests and monitor deaths, says that demonstrations spread to all of the country\u2019s 31 provinces.",
      "The bloody reprisals against protesters are the culmination of decades in which the regime\u2019s \u201cpropensity and ability to use violence\u201d have only increased, said Rouzbeh Parsi, an adjunct lecturer at Sweden\u2019s Lund University. The reason for that is the twin fear of \u201cexternal pressure\u201d and \u201cdomestic hatred\u201d converging, he said.",
      "Some 19,000 people have been arrested, according to HRANA, which says its data comes from on-the-ground sources and goes through multiple internal checks. Iran\u2019s top judge has suggested that there needs to be rapid trials and executions to restore order.",
      "Eyewitness accounts are scant, and those who do report on the situation usually do so anonymously for fear of reprisals.",
      "A video geolocated by NBC News was posted online last weekend showing scores of bodies piled outside a makeshift morgue near Tehran. The scene is punctuated by screams and wails as people converge at the site in search of missing loved ones amid the chaos of the demonstrations. Another video verified by NBC News appears to show security forces firing automatic weapons at demonstrators, the shots echoing through the streets.",
      "Though the internet has now been down for more than a week, Iranians have been able to make some international calls. In calls to The Associated Press earlier this week, Iranians described a heavy security presence on the streets and light foot traffic despite shops reopening.",
      "The diaspora news outlet Tehran Bureau, founded by  journalist Kelly Golnoush Niknejad, who was born in Iran and went to college in America, said witnesses described \u201cwar-like conditions across multiple neighborhoods,\u201d with  \u201cactive battlefields\u201d including \u201cfirearms, military weapons, and sustained clashes.\u201dThe regime uses drones to \u201cidentify gatherings, followed by rapid deployment of forces,\u201d it said.",
      "That surveillance tallies with what Samira Mohyeddin, an Iranian-Canadian journalist, said she was told by a friend\u2019s daughter from the southern Mazandaran province.",
      "Posting a video on X of the conversation in Persian, Mohyeddin recounted that there was \u201cblood on the streets\u201d with drones and riot police maintaining order, and shops forced to close at 4 p.m. She said there had been no clashes in the past two days.",
      "The Iranian regime has decades of precedent for using violence to suppress its opponents, dating back to its foundation.",
      "In 1979, a popular revolution involving students and oil workers toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, an autocratic ruler bolstered by a CIA-backed coup in 1953, and whose SAVAK secret police imprisoned and tortured opponents.",
      "But into that vacuum stepped not a democratic government, but a hard-line Shia theocracy headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.",
      "Throughout the 1980s, Khomeini\u2019s regime began what\u2019s now referred to as a reign of terror against his opponents. In 1988, at least 5,000 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared, executed and dumped in mass graves, according to Amnesty International and other human rights groups.",
      "Then, 2009 brought the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d when millions took to the streets in protest at the apparently rigged re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner. At least 72 people were killed and hundreds more injured, according to opposition figures.",
      "Street marches flared again in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the latter seeing 321 people killed by security forces after demonstrating against rising oil prices, according to Amnesty.",
      "Another high water mark came in 2022 after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman,  died in a hospital after her arrest three days earlier by the country\u2019s morality police. She was accused of not adhering to the government\u2019s mandatory rules on headscarves for women and clothing restrictions.",
      "Thousands of protesters were detained and more than 500 are believed to have died, according to the United Nations. Some were hanged.",

      "\u201cWe just created the Board of Peace, which I think is going to be amazing,\u201d Trump said Tuesday at a White House news briefing. \u201cI wish the United Nations could do more. I wish we didn\u2019t need a Board of Peace, but the United Nations, and, you know, with all the wars I settled, United Nations never helped me on one war.\u201d",
      "While a few leaders have publicly accepted, it is not known whether any have agreed to donate $1 billion to avoid renewing their membership after three years, according to the charter, the text of which was confirmed to NBC News by two sources whose countries received invitations.",

      "Many appear to have been taken aback by the board\u2019s expanding ambitions. Key U.S. allies in Europe have already expressed reservations that the plan could undermine the U.N.'s primacy in conflict resolution, even as Trump has repeatedly threatened to use American military force to take over Greenland.",

Other media outlets quoted from the same letter received by other leaders.",
      "A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told NBC News that at this stage, he \u201cdoes not intend to give a favorable response\u201d to the invitation, citing major questions over respect for the U.N. and whether the board might specifically act as a rival to the Security Council, the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, created in the wake of World War II.",
      "In a separate statement, Macron\u2019s office said the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",
      "Trump responded by threatening late Monday to hit French wines and Champagnes with 200% tariff, apparently in an effort to pressure Macron to change his stance and join his board.",

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a more diplomatic line, telling lawmakers that there were differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza but that it would not harm his relationship with Trump, according to the AP.",

      "Israeli politicians have been highly critical of Trump\u2019s inclusion of diplomats from Qatar and Turkey on a separate advisory committee that will play a strong role in Gaza\u2019s administration. Both, which have also been invited to the Board of Peace, have strained relationships with Israel after its two-year war in Gaza. Netanyahu said Monday that no soldiers from those countries would be allowed into the Palestinian enclave.",

      "In the months since the U.N. Security Council approved Trump\u2019s ceasefire plan for Gaza, the White House\u2019s original concept appears to have broadened, and the board\u2019s new charter does not mention the enclave.",

      "The price tag, along with the board\u2019s guaranteed American dominance, might make membership a tough sell, Miller said.",
      "\u201cIf you sign up for the \u2018Board of Peace,\u2019 you will be aligning yourself with Trump\u2019s vision,\u201d said Miller, who worked closely on Middle East peace negotiations during his decades as an American diplomat. \u201cAdding a billion-dollar entry fee as if this is getting a seasonal membership at Mar-a-Lago has created the sense that this is not serious.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump said  he won\u2019t use military force to acquire Greenland, but sent an unmistakable warning that Europe needs to cede it to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is dropping his threat to slap new tariffs on European nations in a fresh sign that he is prepared to reach a peaceful settlement to a tense standoff over the future of Greenland.",
      "Trump announced on social media that after a private meeting with NATO's secretary general in Davos, Switzerland, he agreed to the \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region.\"",
      "Trump gave no details, nor did he say he was abandoning his effort to wrest control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. Earlier Wednesday, Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in which he said that the U.S. needs to absorb Greenland for global security reasons and that European countries need to meet the demand.",
      "Senior administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, will lead the negotiations over Greenland's fate and report back to him, Trump wrote.",
      "Financial markets spiked at the news that Trump was ditching the 10% tariffs he said he would impose on eight European countries \u2014 part of a pressure campaign to gain possession of Greenland.",
      "For now, Trump seems intent on a negotiated resolution to the Greenland dispute. In his speech, he said he won\u2019t use military force to acquire Greenland, though he left no doubt that he still wants the U.S. to play a dominant role in Greenland's future.",
      "\u201cYou can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember,\" the president told the audience of CEOs, politicians and diplomats.",
      "He said that \"we want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won\u2019t give it. We\u2019ve never asked for anything else.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s appearance at the conference comes amid the biggest crisis within the NATO alliance in decades. Longtime Western allies have cautioned that the rules-based international order is fraying as America threatens the sovereignty of smaller nations. The day before at Davos, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country Trump has also targeted, said that the geopolitical landscape is undergoing not a \u201ctransition,\u201d but a \u201crupture.\u201d",
      "Trump made no apologies for his aggressive push to absorb Greenland, saying the U.S. needs the territory for the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system and to deprive adversaries of a foothold in America\u2019s own hemisphere.",
      "Though the U.S. already has a military base on Greenland \u2014 and European allies said they\u2019re open to an expanded American presence \u2014 Trump said that owning the island would provide more incentive for America to properly defend it. A lease agreement won\u2019t suffice, said Trump, a former real estate magnate.",
      "Trump told the audience that \u201cpsychologically, who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or a lease, which is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean, where if there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles will be flying right over the center of that piece of ice.\u201d",
      "European leaders have sounded baffled and resentful over Trump's efforts to procure Greenland.",
      "\u201cI do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Trump in a private text message the U.S. president posted online this week.",
      "In his speech, Trump laid out his rationale. NATO countries are obliged to defend themselves, and the U.S. is the only allied nation with the strength and resources to protect Greenland from hostile incursions, he said.",
      "\"It's the United States alone that can protect this giant mass of land, this giant piece of ice, develop it and improve it and make it so that it's good for Europe and safe for Europe and good for us,\" Trump said.",
      "He pointed to history. During World War II, Germany overran Denmark, which proved unable to defend itself or Greenland, he said. U.S. forces stepped in and kept the territory out of Hitler's hands. Now, America wants Greenland back. Denmark's defiance ignores the sacrifices American soldiers made, he suggested.",
      "\"Without us, right now, you'd all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps. After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now?\" Trump said.",
      "The audience listened largely in silence, according to a press pool report. There was some light laughter in the room, along with \u201cuncomfortable looks\u201d on the part of some of the attendees.",
      "Upon the president's arrival in Davos after an overnight flight from Washington, someone had written, \u201cTrump Go Home\u201d in the snow near his landing site.",
      "Speaking for more than an hour, Trump at times sounded as if he were delivering a boilerplate campaign address to a home audience. He touted his work over the past year, mentioning that gas prices have dropped and many government \u201cbureaucrats\u201d have been fired, suggesting they're now working in jobs that pay better in the private sector.",
      "He took a swipe at his predecessor, calling him \u201cSleepy Joe Biden,\u201d and said that people would be prosecuted over the 2020 election that made Biden president. Trump contends the election was \u201crigged,\u201d though there is no evidence of wrongdoing on a scale that would have reversed the outcome.",
      "Before he was finished, he bashed windmills, boasted of his \u201clandslide\u201d election victory in 2024 and denigrated the nation of Somalia, as well as the Somali-born congresswoman from Minnesota, Democrat Ilhan Omar. On at least four occasions, he confused Greenland with Iceland.",
      "Some of his most pointed comments were directed at traditional American allies. He questioned whether NATO would come to America\u2019s aid in the event of a war.",
      "\u201cThe problem with NATO is, we\u2019ll be there for them 100%, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d be there for us,\u201d he said.",
      "(After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, NATO invoked Article V for the first time in its history \u2014 a clause stating that the attack on one member was an attack on all.)",
      "During a photo spray before his meeting with Trump, the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, sought to dispel Trump's concern that the alliance would abandon the U.S. in wartime.",
      "\u201cYou can be assured, absolutely, if ever U.S. will be under attack, your allies will be with you. Absolutely, there\u2019s absolute guarantee,\u201d Rutte told Trump. \u201cI really want to tell you this because this is important. It pains me if you think it is not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope that that\u2019s true,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In his speech earlier in the day, Trump also had harsh words for Canada. He said that Canada  \u201cgets a lot of freebies from us,\u201d but is not \u201cgrateful.\u201d",
      "\u201cI watched your prime minister yesterday,\u201d Trump said, in reference to Carney. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t so grateful.\u201d",
      "Before Trump spoke, NBC News interviewed one of his favorite foils: California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who is attending the conference. Trump name-checked Newsom during his speech, calling him a \"good guy\" who \"I used to get along so great with.\"",
      "Newsom, a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said of Trump\u2019s tenure: \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary wrecking ball presidency and administration. And people understand it here. There\u2019s a deep understanding in the United States, the impacts are going to be outsized, the next five, 10, 15 years.\u201d"

      "The message, posted overnight on Truth Social, was part of a flurry of activity as Trump insisted there was \"no going back\" in his campaign to seize the semi-autonomous Danish territory. He also posted a text from the head of NATO, accused Britain of \"stupidity,\" and shared what appeared to be images generated by artificial intelligence depicting the American flag over Greenland and Canada.",

    "story": [
      "Going into this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the White House\u2019s top science and technology adviser, Michael Kratsios, signaled some chilly conversations with European leaders may lie ahead on the topic of artificial intelligence and the way it is regulated.",
      "\u201cI will continue to point out to my tech minister counterparts the ways they can create a regulatory environment to allow AI to thrive,\u201d Kratsios told NBC News, \u201cto make sure they\u2019re not getting ahead of themselves with overburdening regulations, like the EU AI Act, which are an absolute disaster.\u201d For Kratsios, the Trump administration\u2019s light-touch approach to AI regulation is the winning formula.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been an A-B test for decades on how you lead in technology, and it\u2019s very obvious what the recipe is,\u201d said Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and one of the nation\u2019s leading artificial intelligence advisers.",
      "\u201cWe put out probably the most robust, most substantive vision of a pro-innovation AI strategy in the world,\u201d Kratsios said, referencing the White House\u2019s AI Action Plan released in July. \u201cEverywhere we travel, when I meet my fellow tech ministers, they\u2019re all using our language and are all talking about their own AI action plan.\u201d",
      "The administration\u2019s roadmap to American AI dominance, the AI Action Plan is divided into three main sections \u2014 innovation, infrastructure and international diplomacy and security. The blueprint emphasizes the reduction of \u201cred tape and onerous regulation\u201d that \u201cunnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment\u201d by rolling back rules and guidance at various federal agencies, many of which were initiated by President Joe Biden\u2019s 2023 executive order on AI.",
      "Though Kratsios might not be a household name, he wields significant influence over the nation\u2019s technological and economic future. Kratsios is a D.C. policy veteran, having overseen all research and development efforts at the Pentagon as undersecretary of defense before moving to the White House to serve as the nation\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration. A key figure in America\u2019s ongoing AI infrastructure buildout and efforts at the intersection of AI and education, Kratsios spoke to NBC News to reflect on the country\u2019s AI progress at the administration\u2019s one-year mark, and outline his designs for the months ahead.",
      "Kratsios, 39, cut his teeth in the world of private industry, spending much of his early career at Thiel Capital, a venture capital firm founded by Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel. White House AI czar David Sacks and senior policy adviser on AI Sriram Krishnan, also longtime Silicon Valley venture capital magnates, work closely with Kratsios to shape America\u2019s AI agenda.",
      "Eager to encourage the adoption of American AI technology at home and abroad, Kratsios does not mince words about what he sees as bungled approaches to AI policy and stifling overreaches by international bodies.",
      "\u201cThe Action Plan very definitively turned the page on AI doomerism and hostility towards AI innovation that had been the hallmark of the Biden administration,\u201d Kratsios said. \u201cThe president was very clear during the first couple days of the administration that we had to turn that page and create a plan that would ensure the U.S. leads the world in AI.\u201d",
      "Kratsios is clear that the Trump administration\u2019s vision clashes with regulatory structures that have become increasingly visible in the European Union.",
      "The European Union\u2019s AI Act, which Kratsios criticized, imposes varying requirements on AI companies based on the risk posed by their products. The broadest risk evaluation and reporting requirements affect companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, whose powerful foundational models are most likely to present severe or \u201csystemic risks\u201d to society.",
      "\u201cThere are so many countries out there that consistently speak about the importance of having an AI economy and an AI ecosystem and making sure that their citizens can actually enjoy the benefits of AI,\u201d Kratsios told NBC News. \u201cWe want to be the enabler for that.\u201d",
      "Following an executive order in late July, the Department of Commerce in October unveiled a core element of this agenda with a new program to turbocharge American AI exports. Kratsios views this American AI Export Program as one of his focuses for the coming months and outlined key components of the new push.",
      "Kratsios said the program will seek to offer a tailored approach to exporting hardware and software based on a specific country\u2019s AI needs. \u201cWe want to make it as easy as possible for countries around the world to buy our stack and import our stack,\u201d Kratsios said, revealing the Development Finance Corporation and Export Import Bank will provide financing mechanisms for countries to buy a piece of America\u2019s AI ecosystem.",
      "\u201cWe have the very best chips, we have the very best models, we have the very best AI applications. And we want to deliver those solutions to countries around the world so that they can actually benefit from them,\u201d said Kratsios.",
      "In a growing rivalry over global AI dominance, some observers see China as having an edge in diffusing its AI products to other countries. Kratsios sees the Export Program as a key mechanism to entice other countries to use American technology in their pursuit of sovereign AI systems. Kratsios said more details about the program will be announced at February\u2019s AI Impact Summit in India.",
      "Kratsios has long been interested in AI, having led the establishment of the American AI Initiative during Trump\u2019s first administration. Between the two Trump administrations, Kratsios worked in a leadership position at Scale AI, a top data annotation company that received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta.",
      "Kratsios places the federal government\u2019s \u201cGenesis Mission\u201d effort to apply AI to critical scientific problems, announced in November, at the heart of the administration\u2019s push for AI-enabled innovation.",
      "\u201cGenesis Mission is the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo mission towards a scientific endeavor,\u201d Kratsios said, noting the effort\u2019s goal of harnessing the federal government\u2019s vast resources and stores of scientific data for AI. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen an incredible amount of demand and enthusiasm from a lot of our partners and allies around the world.\u201d",
      "Over the coming year, Kratsios said Americans can expect to see the creation of a separate \u201cclosed AI platform\u201d for the initiative, as Department of Energy official Dar\u00edo Gil builds out the Genesis Mission\u2019s physical infrastructure.",
      "Beyond the crown jewel of the Genesis Mission, Kratsios says he champions the role of the federal government in encouraging scientific discovery, rejecting any perceived incongruity between the administration\u2019s approach to America\u2019s scientific funding and its embrace of AI.",
      "\u201cWe as a scientific enterprise today spend almost a trillion dollars per year in research and development, and the vast majority of that, around 70%, is done by the private sector,\u201d Kratsios said. \u201cIf one myopically looks singularly at federal research and development dollars and doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re part of a larger ecosystem, then they\u2019re obviously not going to reap the benefits the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2019I\u2019m very proud, and this was even in the president\u2019s funding request to Congress, that the areas that are most important to the national agenda, like AI and quantum, were preserved and even plussed up in the budget,\u201d Kratsios said.",
      "Some computing research advocates worry that cuts to the larger scientific R&D ecosystem could harm AI innovation, even if AI research funding is held steady. Last week, a Senate committee working on upcoming federal spending bills pushed back on President Trump\u2019s proposed 22% cut to scientific funding and instead floated a 4% reduction in science financing compared to 2025 spending levels.",
      "The Senate\u2019s counterproposal includes a small increase in funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which houses critical federal efforts to evaluate and assess how leading AI models function, an effort Kratsios said \u201ccan be a tremendous unlock to private sector adoption of AI.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s budget requests a $325 million reduction from NIST\u2019s $1.5 billion spending in 2025, citing NIST\u2019s support for \u201ca radical climate agenda,\u201d though it is unclear if these budget cuts would impact NIST\u2019s work on AI.",
      "Kratsios highlighted a recent push to create a new federal framework for AI policy as another key AI win for the private sector and smaller American AI companies, though many advocates of AI oversight remain skeptical that a federal law will sufficiently replace existing state laws.",
      "\u201cCreating a patchwork of AI laws where 50 different states all have different goals is ultimately going to hurt little tech and startups more than anyone else,\u201d Kratsios said, echoing a refrain from Silicon Valley venture capitalists like Marc Andreesen.",
      "President Trump\u2019s executive order from December charged Kratsios, alongside AI czar David Sacks, with preparing legislative recommendations for \u201ca uniform Federal policy framework\u201d that overrides state laws going against the administration\u2019s AI goals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working very hard over the next year on that framework,\u201d Kratsios said."

      "U.S.-allied forces guarding prisons holding thousands of Islamic State group militants in northeastern Syria said Monday that they had lost control of one of the facilities after fighting broke out with fighters loyal to the government in Damascus.",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) added that one prison was less than 2 miles from a U.S.-led coalition base, but it \u201cdid not intervene, despite repeated calls for intervention.\u201d Now the facility was \u201cno longer in SDF control.\u201d",
      "The longtime U.S. ally added on Telegram that it was trying to \u201cprevent a serious security catastrophe.\u201d",

      "The SDF, once the U.S.' main ally in Syria, earlier said it had also clashed with forces affiliated with the Syrian government near another facility holding ISIS detainees, the Al-Aqtan prison on the outskirts of Raqqa, the city that was once the center of the militant group\u2019s short\u2011lived \u201ccaliphate.\u201d",
      "The Syrian army and the SDF on Sunday signed a ceasefire to end fighting that has displaced thousands.",
      "Dozens of SDF fighters have been killed confronting forces affiliated with the Syrian government near the Shaddadi prison in the Hasaka province, the group said, adding it had been working with the international coalition to transfer ISIS detainees from the prison for three days.",
      "The Syrian army accused the SDF of releasing ISIS prisoners from the Shaddadi facility. Units were securing the prison and combing the nearby city of the same name with the aim of arresting those freed, it said in a statement to the Syrian state-run SANA news agency.",
      "\u201cThe Army Command contacted mediators and SDF commanders to hand over al-Shaddadi prison to the Internal Security Forces for the purpose of securing it and its surroundings, but the SDF leadership refused and continues to refuse to this day,\u201d it added.",
      "The fighting broke out a day after Syria\u2019s government and the SDF signed a sweeping integration deal that was supposed to bring much of the autonomous region under government control. Responsibility for prisons housing Islamic State group detainees was meant to be transferred to the government.",
      "SDF leader Mazloum Abdi confirmed it in a video statement, according to The Associated Press. The AP quoted him as saying that the group had accepted the agreement, which stipulates its withdrawal from Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces \u201cto stop the bloodshed.\u201d",
      "Syria\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had ordered the fighting to halt on the front lines after the agreement was announced.",
      "Since toppling Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Syria\u2019s new leaders have struggled to assert their full authority over the war-torn country, but a recent push has seen them gain control over the Deir el-Zour and Raqqa provinces, critical areas under the SDF that include oil and gas fields, and border crossings.",
      "President Ahmad al-Sharaa was shown by the SANA news agency signing and holding the agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for all Syrians of all backgrounds,\u201d al-Sharaa told journalists in Damascus after signing the agreement. \u201cHopefully Syria will end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump and al-Sharaa had a phone discussion about the developments in Syria on Monday, according to SANA.",
      "The two leaders discussed, \"the importance of preserving Syria\u2019s territorial unity and independence, and supporting all efforts aimed at achieving stability,\" SANA said.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said Monday in a post on X that Syria could face sanctions if the fighting continues.",
      "\"If Syrian government forces continue to advance in the north toward Raqqa, I will push for reimposing Caesar Act sanctions on steroids,\" Graham wrote.",
      "He added, \"If this continues, not only will there be bone-crushing sanctions, it will permanently damage relationships between the U.S. and the new Syrian government.\"",
      "The two warring sides are key allies of Washington. U.S. envoy Tom Barrack met with al-Sharaa earlier Sunday as government forces were sweeping into the city of Raqqa and across Deir el-Zour province. Abdi reportedly joined the meeting over the phone.",
      "Barrack praised the agreement, saying on X that it would lead to \u201crenewed dialogue and cooperation toward a unified Syria,\u201d ahead of working on the details of implementing the integration."

      "As European powers scrambled to respond to Trump's promise to implement tariffs on countries that stand in his way, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re went public with the president's warning.",
      "\u201cConsidering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,\u201d Trump said in the message, the text of which was first reported by PBS and confirmed as accurate in a statement by the Norwegian leader.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment from NBC News. Later, Trump was guarded when NBC News asked how far he\u2019d go to take control of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.",
      "Asked if he would use force to seize Greenland, the president said, \u201cNo comment,\u201d in a brief telephone interview.",

      "This allows E.U. countries to take retaliatory action against any rivals seen as threatening the bloc, and could involve restricting American access to tenders or investment proposals.",
      "Some geopolitical and historical experts believe Trump\u2019s pursuit of Greenland has now become the lowest ebb of transatlantic relations since the Suez Crisis of 1956, when the U.S. pressured Britain, France and Israel to withdraw after invading Egypt.",
      "It was against this recent decline in relations that Trump\u2019s message to the Norwegian leader was made public.",
      "\u201cI can confirm that this is a text message that I received yesterday afternoon from President Trump,\u201d the Norwegian leader said.
